= eduard riehl =
eduard august josef riehl ( 22 december 1849 – 9 april 1933 ) was a german painter and art historian , noted for his impressionistic paintings and his passion for the sciences .


== life ==
born in halle an der saale ( today 's czech republic ) , riehl was educated at the halle gymnasium and the königsberg academy , where his father was a student . in 1887 , he enrolled at the university of berlin and then entered the faculty of philosophy in 1889.upon becoming a professor , riehl devoted himself primarily to art and graduated in 1899 . this friendship formed the basis of his collaboration with the mathematician august otto von hayek , the latter of whom he was a lifelong admirer . after his graduation , riehl accepted an appointment as a professor at the university of stuttgart and became an assistant professor in 1902 , professor in 1905 , and full professor in 1911.in 1896 , he was appointed artistic director at the humboldt university of berlin . he held this position until 1910.in 1910 , riehl was appointed director of the humboldt university of berlin , a position which he held until 1916 , when the university was transferred to munich . the remainder of his career was spent at the riehl-koch-werke museum in leipzig and the institute for historical art and the art of guillaume-françois cabanis in london .


== views ==
influenced by the concepts of the german romantic philosophy , riehl took an interest in various branches of psychology and had a deeply significant influence on his successors in art . riehl was a conservative member of the société impressionisme . in the field of mythology , he strove to find an identification between the expressive forms of the mythological images , as represented by the concrete sculptures , and the relations between thought and life in the painter 's own consciousness .
in the influence of many influential early german romantic psychologists , such as hermann schelling and carl jung , riehl wanted to pursue an interest in historical themes through his narrative . riehl wrote a number of books on the theme of the history of art and ideas . his most influential works are hermann schelling and the rhine : die weltkrankheit in der hochschen altertums ( 1900 ) , and deutschlands geographie ( 1906 ) . after suffering from various crises in his career , he was forced to resign from his chair at the humboldt university of berlin , and was succeeded by the theologian josef köhn , a man well versed in the study of german romanticism and the philosophy of aesthetics , whose historiological style still remains influential .

= giuseppe tanca =
giuseppe tanca ( 11 september 1782 – 24 july 1843 ) was an italian naturalist , zoologist , and paleontologist .

the young tanca could draw and use the most basic zoological knowledge . the chief problem to be solved was to see if any trace of fossil animals could be found in the earth , at that time the most productive geological resources in the world . tanca studied in the same gymnasium as other renowned naturalists , such as sir joseph banks , isaac newton and archibald spencer.tanca also studied physics and chemistry , and wrote short works on these subjects . after his graduation he joined the anatomical laboratory of the archaeologist j. schleiermacher . this was an extraordinary laboratory for the time , being a state museum of egypt , the discoverer of the first pyramid of giza .
at this time tanca began to treat in much greater detail the phanerogams of insects . an opportunity to visit the ancient botanical garden of florence 's scuola sarmiento ( all around it were the preserved skeletons of more than 150 famous lepidopterists , from around the world ) presented him with the idea of an expedition to asia , a goal that aroused the excitement of the florence academy , and also provided him with an opportunity to collect as many insect fossils as possible . before his departure for asia , tanca developed a theory of animal camouflage that was much more direct than the attempts by other investigators . the hypothesis predated napoleonic campaigns in asia . its explanation was a reservoir of water that the insect hid in the larvae .
in early april 1804 tanca and his scientific crew arrived at the site of the pyramids of giza . they found that the sphinx had been reinforced with elaborate brickwork . tanca completed his scientific work before leaving for asia .
at his death in 1843 tanca 's collections reached an estimated 400,000 specimens .

= isaac lechner =
isaac lechner ( january 9 , 1906 – march 8 , 1983 ) was an american physicist and physicist-cum-mysterious polonium expert .


== early life ==
lechner was born on january 9 , 1906 , in wierau , lithuania ( now ukraine ) to a jewish father and a german mother who emigrated in 1933 . he grew up in the nearby town of wittau , a suburb of berlin , germany , and attended the oberlin , oberlin university and jena universities , studying physics and chemistry and mathematics . during world war ii , he enlisted in the german army , serving as a meteorologist in the german army meteorological observation station near mantua , italy . while in germany , he was promoted to private in the 1st battalion on 23 november 1942 , serving in the verdun area . in 1945 he was offered a commission in the st. quentin highlanders and in the following year joined the military special air service , serving as a meteorologist at special air station louisville in southwest louisiana . later , in 1949 , he accepted a fellowship in physics at brookhaven national laboratory in new york city , and became an assistant at the laboratory in 1959 . he was appointed director of the laboratory in 1970 , and in 1973 was chosen director of the brookhaven national accelerator laboratory ( now the brookhaven national laboratory ) .


== career ==
during his career , lechner distinguished himself as one of the world 's leading experts on polonium and produced original documents and reports on its scientific characteristics and investigation . although he never claimed to have made any discoveries , in 1946 he was awarded the nobel prize in physics , and many of the isolated studies involving polonium apparently had their origin in lechner 's reports . some of the most widely cited reports , for example his `` sudbury detector `` for the uranium biological monitoring project , or the `` eitzenberg experiment `` are based on these reports.in addition , lechner served as a member of a team investigating polonium from the czechoslovakian uranium industry in the early 1960s . although the work was not recognized at the time , lechner was awarded the levitating meteorite award by the lifr in 1966.in the summer of 1962 , he joined a team of american scientists investigating the earth 's magnetosphere from the uk , that included edward teller , hans bethe , gordon moore , andre j. fermi , joseph e. diels and james bingham . it was during this trip to the uk that lechner formed his initial contacts with high-ranking soviet government officials who were likely sharing the soviet government 's `` great enthusiasm for nuclear weapons research `` and he became the first polish to obtain a visiting position at the soviet academy of sciences ( 1974 ) . later , in the 1980s , lechner was tasked with investigating the x-ray trails left by the soviet nuclear missile tests that involved solid state nuclear reactors . when this project was concluded , lechner was asked to be the lead scientist of the cold water uranium project in the uk , and in 1985 he founded a company , radiation sciences , to export irradiated uranium . in 1991 , lechner joined and became a consultant to steven schiff , one of the pioneers of the manhattan project in the us and a finalist for the nobel prize in physics in 1986.after leaving the laboratory in 1974 , lechner was named director of brookhaven national accelerator laboratory ( now brookhaven national laboratory ) , the us government-funded physics research facility in new york city .


== in popular culture ==
lechner is portrayed in the 2003 film 10,000 days of summer , alongside felicity huffman , kyle chandler , morgan freeman , samuel l. jackson , kyle chandler 's brother chandler hessler , samuel l. jackson and michael rooker .

the strength of his voice lies in the way he can allow the guitar and the piano to thrive in a particular set of arrangements . the trios he composed with nadol , dumoulin , and morand-séguin are based on previously recorded pieces , and had the benefit of circulating in several major cities , often at the time when much of the music they were based on was being written and recorded .


== education and early life ==


=== background ===
adèle ollivier was born in meyrin , brittany . he started his career in the music conservatory of the royal city of valence . in 1867 , his formative years , the `` affaire de musique `` was founded , founded in memory of claude-hugues dicapie , and his teachers were determined to bring him closer to the choirs of the regnum des theon . with the help of his brother-in-law , léonard de solberg , ollivier began his studies of composition with georges bizet .


=== ministry ===
the ministry of music was in direct competition with the choir of valence , which became very popular .
after six years of working in the choirs , ollivier was demoted to the rank of secretary in the ministry of music . after six years as a minister , he went to paris , where he stayed for eleven years , starting in 1878 . a later success was the establishment of the conservatoire de paris .


=== work and life ===
on 18 october 1878 , ollivier married jacqueline , also from meyrin , and soon after moved back to paris to begin his studies . there he published a collection of simple songs called contrêt de jésus , which was published in 1890 . he also wrote pieces for the piano . he also wrote for the opera dieu du monde , and in 1906 he joined the cadenza school of music.on 3 june 1908 , the second of the concerts to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the restoration , ollivier succeeded dicapie in the chair of the musical studies of the conservatoire de paris.the composer was given access to one of the most sophisticated sets of piano rolls ever assembled by composers , and his method , which included extended passages of repeated measures and successive notes , was lauded by george massenet and w. h. auden.in november 1907 , dicapie left the conservatoire , and with it his new ministry of music . after that , ollivier became head of the school of composition . he was under the great responsibility of one of the greatest composers of all time , mozart .


=== death and legacy ===
ollivier died in paris on 10 april 1876 , aged 68 . ollivier left behind two daughters and six grandchildren . he left behind the operas zappia and il moro and three symphonies ( fantasie , the rape of lucrezia , les imaginations ) . he was buried in valence .

carl friedrich konrad vollmer ( 30 may [ o.s . 3 may ] 1768 in würzburg , bavaria – 13 january 1811 in munich , germany ) was a german anatomist and lithographer , best known as an inventor of the vollmer tube .


== biography ==


=== early life and education ===
born on 30 may 1768 , he grew up near würzburg in eastern bavaria . he was educated at the university of würzburg from 1790 to 1793 . he attended lectures of 1792 and 1795 at the lectures of the physiologist and anatomist christian wilhelm thiele at the university of tübingen .


=== career ===
vollmer 's career , which began in the year 1792 , was a difficult one . the monetary situation of the time made it difficult for talented young men to be sent to study medicine .
because of his poor health , vollmer completed his dissertation in 1798 at the university of tübingen . he gave lectures on anatomy at the teubner-schule in 1805 . that year , however , his health failed . in january 1806 , he left germany for the first time .
during this period , he experimented with both microscopes and an instrument for quickly tracing microvascular changes .


=== biography ===
as a result of his lectures and work , in 1812 vollmer was hired as a lecturer at the university of münster , where his lectures were notably wide-ranging . he used the microscope to determine the rectum . this turned out to be a good tool for reconstructing anatomy ; it was specially trained to use a microscope . but vollmer was eager to learn anatomy , and was never satisfied with what he learned .
in 1813 , vollmer was a posthumously appointed professor at the university of tübingen . here , he met andré messner . messner spent a year teaching at the university , and led vollmer 's early anatomical students on their studies of the lungs and other organs . in 1815 , vollmer was made a full professor , and the following year , he was named rector of the gymnasium of tübingen .
in 1816 vollmer became president of the volksbücher ( the society of bacteriologists ) ; he helped to expand the standard of knowledge regarding bacteria and eventually is credited as having laid the foundations of current microscopic microbiology .


=== later life ===
in 1823 , his wife , ursula verkoper , moved to england . the next year , vollmer married constance kreft , the daughter of an unsuccessful clergyman . they had six children .
as a result of his work , many later scientists , physicians and teachers would repeat vollmer 's discoveries . in his paper `` on the gastrocnemius rectum `` published in 1826 , vollmer wrote :

this anatomical system is based upon certain facts : that the nucleus of the gastrocnemius circumscribed by messner is the external junction of the different organs and its five subvening alimentary productions , the axillary-carca , the cryptogastric-adrenal , the adenosine-adrenal , the poppy-choroidal-nucleus , and the cholera-canceric ; that the proximal part of the urinary-vascular-body is the tubular secretion from the several lymphatic cells which are in great abundance throughout the body ; that this secretion is the centre of fermentation in all the clitocytotenyes of which we are aware , as they give the cause of the fermentation ; that the discharging division of this secretion from all the obstructed portions makes the ultimate separation of the small number of jars-pairs which are placed in the genital glands ; and , finally , that the sexual relation is a product of the internal structure rather than of the external operation .

vollmer died in munich in 1811 .

in 1917 , the stalinist bureaucracy of the russian socialist republic for which véffer was a member officially replaced véffer with a labor type whose relation to communist enterprises differed from that of organized labor .
while in office in 1917 , a fire of the munitions department destroyed most of his family and home in ansemblage d'uni et de la danse-verneux , a district in paris 's angers-pyrénées region .
during the first world war , he was a contributor to articles in the international economic review and specialized in economic and monetary history .


== business cycles theory ==
in his first major essay on the doctrine of business cycles he opposed the policy of censorship enforced by the then ruling committee of ministers . in his 1907 essai sur la société d'economic , véffer sought to reconcile the keynesian doctrine of business cycles with market orientation and the concept of profit . he suggested a modified version of the consumptionist approach to economic organization .
véffer believed that decisions were made in search of optimal prices . his examination of the products of the various french industries ( cotton , horse , cattle , rubber , & c. ) , and of the conditions under which it produced , produced , and exported all its goods enabled him to formulate the theory of the circulation of capital and trade . after world war i véffer was professor of economics and political science in paris and principal of the prestigious collège de france .

paul heinrich hefley ( 24 may 1876 – 22 june 1965 ) was a german-australian physicist , nobel laureate in physics and a member of the nobel council .


== biography ==
born in hamburg , hefley studied physics and mathematics at the universities of hamburg and berlin , where he received his ph.d. in 1915 . from 1921 to 1933 he worked as a lecturer in physics at the max planck institut für physik and on the max planck institute for physics ( 1935–1937 ) . in 1937 , hefley , with karl hartmann , invented a magnetic confinement device that gave great advantage to depth-charge ray spectroscopy . their device was the first comprehensive , non-conventional use of photon diffraction microscopy ( now called diffraction assisted spectroscopy ) to resolve the dim stellar parallax of stars , which had previously been achieved with conventional techniques . hefley and hartmann invented and developed an improved version of this device that also had great advantages for the development of the development of non-conventional techniques such as scattering electron microscopy and supernova detection .
the experimental demonstration of diffraction assisted , laser-induced optical methods for detecting ultrastructural features in subatomic particles was announced on the occasion of hefley 's 100th birthday celebration in 1939.in the 1950s , hefley published several papers on the spectroscopic technique for polarization change , many of which were technically very good . when physicist j. t. leakey , an independent author of similar papers , started to exploit them in his laser-induced phase transition paper , hefley 's position in the early effort to leverage them became more clear .


== selected scientific awards and honors ==
hefley was awarded the world 's first interferometer award for outstanding achievements in the field of photophysics and was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1938 . in recognition of his services to physics and optics , in 1971 , an international award was instituted to honor him .
he also received the copley medal , the r. h. goddard medal , the bernard a. stockton award for civilian service and an honorary doctorate from the university of glasgow .

schindler obtained his ph.d. from the university of vienna and obtained his habilitation in 1901 , the year after his phd . he spent some time in england before returning to vienna . he stayed in this post until 1922 , becoming a professor at the university of vienna in 1924 and at the university of kiel from 1925 to 1928 . from 1924 to 1930 he was the director of the institute of radiation-induced spectroscopy at the kaiser-wilhelm-institute of technology in kiel .


== contributions to optics ==
schindler began the field of optical spectroscopy at the university of vienna . he began to research very early on the optical properties of metallic salts , some of which were used in the invention of the coherer for optics in 1842 . schindler studied coherer demonstrations , demonstrations of emission spectra and later became interested in the diffusion model ( f/dt change ) . he studied variations of f/dt change in crystals and crystallography using diffraction gratings . in addition , he studied f/dt change in resistive crystals and absorption spectra .
in the late 1820s he introduced the term f/dt change to describe diffraction transformations . in the late 1830s and 1841 he studied emission spectra . however , although he and co-workers discussed the possibility of using coherer-type f/dt change in spectrum , there were early difficulties in the measurement of this effect . later however , with additional equipment and a more modern technical understanding , schindler was able to derive spectra that were measurable .

his first book was the causes of modern tribulations ( 1902 ) . he published three more books on the subject . gould 's introductory book , the genomic heritage of man ( 1907 ) , taught first-class medical school students about genetic inheritance . later he published practical genetics , how it is explained and how it can help you , which was to be reprinted as a volume by methuen in 1930 . his next book , genetics : foundations of social science ( 1929 ) was an exploration of the origins of the idea of human genetics . in this book he showed that each species from around the world has a `` large `` or `` minor `` gene , and he used the term `` genotype `` to refer to the physical characteristics of the individuals within a species . he argued that the process of generation would evolve the first hominids from an original population .
in the 1930s , gould also introduced the concept of pelvic cysts , conceived as a type of penile fistula that developed in certain hominid groups , and was believed to be an early sign of penile 'alignment ' ( a developmental characteristic in some species and animals that corresponds with how male or female an individual is ) .

== life ==
meyer was born on 20 june 1847 in trier , germany to german parents and his second wife , adele rosberg.he studied mathematics at the universities of tübingen , berlin and munich .
he became interested in physics while a student in berlin and the rest of his life . meyer published his first paper on the kinetic theory of gases in 1877 . he showed that those gases which dissipated under a pressure greater than 300 bar had an entropy not less than that of pure air , and that the same value of entropy , if given an analogous temperature , could be found with equal certainty as long as the temperature difference was positive . after removing the homogeneous state of the atoms ( thermodynamic entropy ) , meyer came to the conclusion that in a closed atmosphere at room temperature the entropy of a free substance was not less than the entropy of an identical system which was subjected to different pressures , and that the entropy of a free substance was not less than the entropy of a corresponding algusmic system . he derived the only general equation applicable to all gases , which used the temperature difference and velocity as an adequate measure of the entropy , which equation was already used by others . meyer 's most famous application of the entropy equation was in his calculations for the efficiency of iron production during the economic depression of 1873 .
in 1881 , meyer received a doctorate from the university of göttingen . in 1885 he was elected member of the berlin academy of sciences .

john edwin `` bob `` winslow ( april 3 , 1937 – april 15 , 1998 ) was an american wildlife biologist and explorer . he led the great lakes biological station , an early and successful scientific research station in the lake superior area , working closely with scientists such as michael d'arcy wadsworth and john g. friese .


== biography ==
bob winslow was born on april 3 , 1937 in cleveland , ohio , to owners george `` bob `` and caroline ( charles ) winslow , the son of donald w. winslow , a teacher and businessman .
in 1971 , at the age of 20 , he embarked on his exploration career and eventually led the great lakes biological station , located at the muskegon conference center in muskegon , michigan . it was operated by the united states fish and wildlife service , with the goal of studying and protecting the land , animals , and natural resources of lake superior and the surrounding area . after world war ii , funding to support the station was more than possible , but the vast majority of funding was provided by the american association for the advancement of science , and by private donations . worshipful donations from the texas-based bishop barney flood funded the early period . despite years of trying , and extensive staff and equipment spending , the station 's first expedition to the region , in 1977 , was unsuccessful . in 1980 , the station was refitted with a searchlight and twenty television cameras and fourteen remote-controlled aircraft , among other equipment.in the 1980s , he led the great lakes biological station when it was absorbed into the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts . the base remained in woods hole until 1986 , before being merged with the university of michigan institute of oceanography in ann arbor . his supervisor at the institute was the leading marine biologist and ecologist of his day , michael d'arcy wadsworth . he also advised regional fisheries on biological conservation , work with scientific expeditions to animal husbandry , fish biology , and geological and paleoecological research .
during the mid-1980s , he joined its thunderbird substation in the grand marais experimental reserve , for which he became director from 1990 to 1995 . he was responsible for the wildlife research station and the bay of fundy substation , and also lead the muskegon substation . he is best known for creating the geology part of the great lakes biological station ( gmbs ) and other expeditions . he died of heart failure at the age of 84 . his unpublished books and articles are among the numerous documentation and artifacts in the great lakes biological station collections , as well as some of the science experiments and works of the great lakes substation at the university of michigan.one of the scientists working with the station at its zenith , writing in the biologist in 1984 , said that his contribution to the field was the creation and management of a model substation—two hundred of the best-equipped and most capable 'land mammal station'ever built—which greatly expanded ecological sampling of natural areas around muskegon , lake superior , and the lower great lakes . he also wrote that his predecessor , prof. w. christopher whipple of the united states department of agriculture 's fish and wildlife service , `` spent half a million dollars and spent ten years establishing a large laboratory in most of michigan and oklahoma. ``
he also wrote , `` the potential of lake superior `` was highlighted by wyno m. minklum-leach in the ecologist .


== other contributions ==
his two areas of focus , interest in wildlife breeding , and research on waterway sedimentary features , are cited by richard frey on his environmental questions , watersheds : the story of fish ( n.y. : macmillan , 1997 ) . he also made significant contributions in `` physical anthropology of fisheries `` , along with a high energy study of finfish and two pacific walleyes ( 2006 ) , both of which were published in the journal of applied physiology .
he also helped refine and publish six influential major scientific journals , including the journals of biology , palaeobiology , and entomology . he was editor-in-chief of the quarterly journal current biology from 1988 to 1996 , the journal of biology from 1994 to 1996 , and the journal of marine and freshwater sciences from 1993 to 1999.winslow and larry buttric founded the great lakes association of women in biology .

== life and career ==
wilson was born in fife on 11 june 1859 , the second of six children of william douglas wilson , superintendent of fife county schools , and his wife harriet emma ( née slade ) , née jones . he was educated at the parish school in argyll and then , in 1891 , at st. andrews grammar school in edinburgh.wilson studied at the university of edinburgh graduating m.a . in 1894 , m.s . in 1900 and m.sc . in 1905.following an examination at the cavendish laboratory in 1896 , he was appointed demonstrator in geology by sir archibald heyns , director of the royal geological survey ( see geological map of scotland ) , and went on to study at the university of edinburgh for a total of six years . he then went on to teach at university college , london and the royal naval academy , portsmouth.in 1903 he joined the geological survey of scotland and served for thirty years . his work , in which he developed the work of fossil geologist william greer smyth on the microscopic structures of the silurian , was further influential on modern geology .


== contributions ==
as well as the first-hand knowledge of geological matters from dealing with silurian rocks , wilson found many of greer smyth 's seminal works to be derived from surveying in caves . while he proved correct in his geological maps of scotland ( wilson 2000 ) , smyth 's maps , it is said , began to be identified with a style of map-making which wilson was not keen on .

josef landau ( 18 january 1856 – 3 december 1941 ) was a german physiologist , who , in 1908 , discovered that spontaneous nerve excitability in the human brain could be entirely mediated by the presence of manganese cyanide.landau was born in lüneburg , germany . after graduating from the university of lüneburg in 1881 , he went to the university of vienna , where he obtained his doctorate in 1885 . at the beginning of his career , he was assistant to hermann mueller and daniel von willmann . during this period , he and his student ernst elzen prepared photochemical analysis of tissues in rats and humans . later , landau and his students were able to determine the electrophysiological signal-to-noise ratios in the human brain from arteriovenous perfusion .
his research into brain activity was subsequently dedicated to photochemical activity . landau and others noted that it was the calcium-dependent microstimulation induced by an implanted electrode that stimulated the human brain . these discoveries led to the construction of the electronic stimulator for the `` electric stimulator `` . he was a representative of the viennese physical society and the biochemical society .
landau died in vienna , and is buried there .


== life and research ==
landau was born in lüneburg , germany . his father had been a timber merchant , and his mother was from a well-to-do family .

nikolai constantinovich baynes ( russian : александр боринович пата́тинов ; 25 february 1790 – 2 january 1834 ) was a russian and russian-american mathematician .


== biography ==
born on a farm in siberia , baynes studied at the university of kiev and in 1804 received a doctorate under nikolai dmitrievich shokalskiy . in 1805 he traveled to the united states , and soon became a member of the united states mathematics department , becoming professor of algebra and probability theory in 1815 . in 1831 he was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences , the same year also joining the russian academy of sciences . he was among the first to perform a rigorous mathematical proof that arbitrary infinitesimals can be represented in a formula as a set of cubics with analytic powers . his proof also influenced the definition of zero ( = − ) .baynes also started an academic correspondence with j.h . helmholtz , who soon went on to prove that the boltzmann equation can also be represented as a term vector on a quadratic complex . he also made contributions to universal additive algebras and group theory .
baynes left the university of st. petersburg in 1808 . in 1817 he returned to the u.s. and resumed teaching at the faculty of mathematics at the newly established school in philadelphia , but he also became the standard authority on probability theory . he died on 2 january 1834 in philadelphia .


== theory of integral equations ==
baynes developed his theory of integral equations later in the 18th century , which is now more commonly known as partial differential equations or partial differential equations . by removing the algebraic assumptions from these equations ( now known as binomial integrals ) , baynes helped explain the solutions of integral equations in terms of the minimal invariants that they give . for example , a solution of an integral equation `` n `` must be the product of the adjacent equations `` m `` and `` n `` . he also proved in 1802 that a direct estimate of the square root of the number of moments of the integrator can be derived from the extent of the tangent space .
this proof of the fundamental principle that a solution of a particular integral equation can be developed from any number of possible solutions is sometimes referred to as `` baynes'proof `` . as a consequence , integral equations are commonly found in probability theory.in the following chapters , the remainder of a chapter , and the bulk of the rest of the book are dedicated to examples of examples , and exposition of the principles .

ernest eisenberger ( german : [ ˈɛzɐ ] ; 30 june 1865 – 25 february 1916 ) was a german physicist , one of the founders of the nobel prize-winning radium theory of x-rays .


== biography ==
eisenberger was born in berlin , the son of a wealthy bakers and sawmill owner . after a law school career in munich , he earned a doctorate ( 1902 ) in physics from university of munich and a ph.d. in 1906 from cambridge university . he had been close to the swiss physicist albert einstein for 20 years .
he was a colleague of max born ( 1911-1996 ) at cambridge , which together they published on the scattering of x-rays by x-rays emitted from a two-dimensional crystal . in this work , which would prove to be the foundation of the einstein–eisenberg equations , eisenberger developed the discovery of an important source of radiation left over after the atoms'separation from the nucleus . for the next 20 years he worked intensively with his german undergraduate colleagues to study this radiation , deducing a general principle that enabled the first observations of ultra-violet x-rays .
he remained at cambridge for the rest of his career . in 1924 eisenberger co-founded the max planck institute for radioactivity , which became the max planck institute for nuclear physics , or m.p.n. , in leipzig .
the nobel committee , as was its wont , awarded eisenberger the nobel prize in physics in 1952 .
a department ( now known as the institute for nuclear physics and chemistry at the leipzig university of technology , also known as `` leitfaden-innsbruck `` ) was established in 1955 , and the eisenberger laboratory was established for the study of atomic bases at the national physical laboratory . the international atomic energy agency dedicated a research chair to eisenberger in 1978 . he died in leipzig , aged 85 , in 1916 .

ernest charles davis ( 3 november 1888 – 3 march 1977 ) was a canadian ichthyologist . he studied the chytrid fly and diatomaceous anglerfish of the blue mountains , and developed a line of hardy freshwater shellfish that served in europe for many years . he was a co-founder of the division of marine science at the department of fisheries and oceans canada . davis was also the founder and chairman of the applied fisheries laboratory at fisheries and oceans canada in ottawa .


== early life and education ==
ernest charles davis was born on 3 november 1888 in ottawa , ontario , canada . in 1916 , he entered the ottawa university college of agriculture , where he attended the normal 1st-class courses for men and women until 1919 . during the same year , he became a member of the ottawa aquatic club . he graduated from the school in 1920 , and subsequently took an associate level course in fisheries and oceans at the university of cambridge , england . he married helen mary hall on 21 september 1926 , and they had three children . they had one daughter , charles julia roberta davis , from a previous marriage . davis served as a teacher and director of the university of ottawa 's school of fisheries in ottawa and cornwall in ottawa county from 1942 to 1945 . he is listed in the canadian biological register as a naturalist . he died on 3 march 1977 , in ottawa , ontario .


== research ==
after his return to canada , davis enrolled in the zoology department at the university of toronto from where he obtained his phd in 1925 with his thesis on the ecological habits and lives of chrysecodidae . thereafter , he concentrated on the study of marine fish , focusing on several genera of chrysecodidae , especially the littoral drift-fish , that his students and associates named with him as ernst davis and other family members of davis and boddy-buttlin . his taxonomic work in fishes involved attention to early life and identification of patterns and anatomical modifications in the mollusks he studied , as well as histological characterization of the meat and skin of chrysecodidae . his studies also included the biological history of a small population of agamidae and indo-pacific blood-sailfish . he collected a large number of species from many areas of the northern atlantic , asia , and the pacific ocean , and his efforts to catalog species in both ecological and benthic settings earned him the title of a corresponding author on important principles of taxonomy .
in 1936 , davis returned to the university of toronto to spend a few years as a graduate assistant and visiting fellow at the university of cambridge . while there , he and his wife traveled through china , japan , india , and the bering sea region , frequently searching for chrysecodidae specimens and cetaceans and examining their environments and biology . he further published on his travels and observations in the quarterly journal of the royal society of canada , the journal of experimental biology , and the royal society of freshwater science .
in 1957 , davis accepted the position of professor of biology at the university of ottawa , and in 1961 was appointed vice-president of the international council of pure and applied fisheries . during the 1960s , davis lectured on echinoderms , particularly odonata coracina , and on the physiology of tunicates , including the life history of several fish species and the ecology of anglerfish . he maintained a long-term relationship with oda , a naturalist and mountaineer who , like davis , had come to the centre in pursuit of a scientific career .
in 1969 , davis resigned from the faculty and joined the ranks of science conservationists . while at the university , davis organized and sponsored conferences on fish , bryophytes , and ocean ecology in several canadian universities . during the early 1970s , davis consulted for the department of fisheries and oceans and worked closely with the canadian naturalist as it prepared a catalogue of new canadian fish species . davis remained active with the department , founding the staff that composed the institute of marine fisheries in 1977 and serving on the senate of the institution . he returned to ottawa after retirement from the department in 1977 to teach fisheries at the university .


== recognition and honors ==
in 1996 , he was named in the canadian and international order of merit . he was the recipient of numerous medals , awards , and citations , including the silver medal of the canadian red cross , the marine conservation medal , and the royal canadian red cross silver medal . davis was the recipient of two honorary degrees from the university of ottawa .

henry henry henderson ( 10 december 1824 – 22 january 1901 ) was an australian oceanographer , geographer , and botanist . he was among the first to describe the stegogyne breviorum butterfly .
he was born at perth , near cape york , australia , to a respected merchant and banker , henry blackett henderson . his father was a merchant and linen-seller ; his mother was an accomplished author . henry married his wife , sarah , in 1854 , and began his career in 1859 as the first new south wales government botanist in port kembla.in 1866 , henderson became director of the herbarium in sydney , and afterwards served as principal of the school , the academy of science and art , and the royal botanic gardens sydney . at the university of sydney , he met and befriended the italian astronomer giovanni battista cavalli-sforza , the son of a gardener , and the younger brother of desiderata baldi .
henderson developed a special interest in butterfly eggs , initially collecting butterfly specimens . he realised that , in as little as a month , a great number of the eggs could be identified as they had no antennae . this observation prompted him to take a more active role in educating students on the butterflies , to demonstrate that they could be studied in the field , and to develop his collection of caterpillars . he also made special studies of the dramatic escape of the butterfly from a coconut from a lighthouse at waihoui in qinghai in 1873 , then wrote several books on the study of butterflies .
he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1874 , and was president of the royal australasian college of science ( then called australian college of science ) in 1885 . he was a member of the sydney school of tropical medicine , and a fellow of the royal society of new south wales . in 1870 , he established the australian herbarium in sydney , and he was one of its first administrators , as a voluntary trustee . he also became a representative of the british association in 1878 , and was a founding member of the royal australasian association for the advancement of science . henderson died at sydney .
he was posthumously awarded a carnegie medal in 1892 .


== legacy ==
henderson was recognised as a scientist by the aborigines medal and the australian philosophical society in 1892 .
he was elected a fellow of the royal statistical society in 1875 .
henderson was a member of the board of trustees of the new south wales academy of science .
the monarch butterfly is named in his honour .

wilkes was born on july 19 , 1912 , in philadelphia , pennsylvania , the son of john wilkes , a professor of physics at the university of pennsylvania , and peggy maurice , the daughter of her first husband , t. h. paul . wilkes was educated at eastman school in philadelphia , and then at harvard university where he was a first-year graduate student in biochemistry . he received his ph.d. in biochemistry in 1942 at the massachusetts institute of technology with his thesis on the activity of polysaccharides , in which he demonstrated that the enzyme he found in potato tuber extract could catalyze inactivation of starch as a by-product . wilkes wrote his dissertation under the supervision of ralph halpern , a research chemist from the materials research center at harvard .


== career ==
roger wilkes worked for the university of pennsylvania biological sciences department as a university lecturer , receiving his ph.d. in 1946 , under the direction of richard alum of the university of wisconsin . he began working at the california institute of technology in 1948 , as a post-doc in the cavendish laboratory , where he worked with ralph hammes , later to become the head of the cavendish laboratory , to investigate a protease reaction from mitochondria to produce f4 ( trypsin a ) and f7 ( glutathione s ) . he became a senior research fellow at columbia university in 1955 , where he worked on lipid metabolism , cell membrane permeability , and the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum plasticity . he was a member of the national academy of sciences ( 1949 ) , science writers of america ( 1950 ) , and the national academy of engineering ( 1956 ) .in 1957 , wilkes joined the faculty at mit as professor of biochemistry and he remained at mit as professor of biochemistry until his retirement in 1980 . he died on january 6 , 1981 in his home in boston .


== research ==
one of wilkes'major contributions to biochemistry was his discovery of the enzyme thioglycolate dehydrogenase in 1947 . this enzyme is now widely used in clinical laboratories , and is one of only two enzymes that can oxidize a small number of insoluble compounds , while the other is an enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic respiration of lipids and sugars . it is also active against rust , and wilkes was instrumental in the creation of the george b. tronikoff fluid cycling system .
wilkes also is known for his development of the wilkes–schlakow colorimetric calorie screen for health professionals in 1961 . this system can predict the life expectancy of individuals using a color change indicator . he was a co-founder of the national academy of sciences in 1971.wilkes was the senior recipient of the joseph l. ingraham endowed fellowship in 1950 , and the elliott c. watts endowed fellowship in 1954 . he received the charles p. steel foundation prize of the atomic energy research foundation in 1955 , the frederick j . pierce foundation honoris causa award in 1960 , the hughes school award for research in protein science , and the armented g. williams bancroft medal in 1964 . he was a fellow of the american institute of chemists and the american society for cell biology . he was an honorary member of the chemical research foundation of great britain .
wilkes is noted for his collaboration with the young derek fryar on enzyme action in hydrocytes , for his work in co-division with halpern on enzyme synthesis in plants and algae , and for the wilkes–schlakow experiment that showed how the specific protein orientation of enzymes affects their activity . in addition to his many research contributions , he is a widely respected biochemist with over 125 research publications , and he has an extensive and valued role in scientific education and management .

francis william hopson ( february 15 , 1876 – april 9 , 1946 ) was an american psychologist . he was professor of psychology at brown university .


== biography ==
hopson was born in greensboro , north carolina , to william edward hopson and jane jessamine hincks.he attended brown university , where he earned a b.s . degree in education and psychology in 1902 . he then received a m.s . degree in education in 1905 , and ph.d. in psychology in 1912 . he was a lecturer in psychology in the same city from 1912 to 1927 , and professor of psychology in the same university from 1927 to 1952 .


== work ==
hopson introduced many controversial , albeit valid , theories into the field of psychology . one is characterized as the mise-en-scène in which an article appeared in science magazine which attempted to explain the mind by a variation of the path hypothesis . he wrote about how evolution of the human mind had `` led to the hyperconsciousness of individuals. `` ( p. 11 ) the hypersensitive individual postulates that a sensitive individual may go through a state of heightened awareness .
`` he is in many ways an extreme forerunner of ethologists , who throughout history have investigated the feelings and thoughts of persons in the presence of abstract ideas. `` ( p. 70 ) .


== views ==
he believed that the belief of evolution in human beings is contradicted by evolution in other animal species . he believes that both were `` one in the same `` and possibly a side of the same history . he criticized the `` habit of rationalism `` which anthropologists saw developed in europe , america , and asia . hopson believed that it is `` an almost lazy approach to problems . it has acquired a profound influence on the relation between race and science . `` hopson wrote books about his career . in 1916 he wrote the mechanisms of behavior ( the cambridge philosophical library series ) in which he attempted to explain the differences between three different types of behaviour . he believed that animal behaviour was likely influenced by the ancestors who had lived for many thousands of years , `` though it is necessary to admit the fact that , if we want to make progress in psychology , we need to learn how to accept the results of evolutionary psychology. `` this book was inspired by william irvine , who had also made the first attempt to explain animal behaviour , but his experiments were conducted with `` small animals `` and he did not make an attempt to control for potential confounding factors .

joseph-marie gent ( 5 december 1838 – 10 march 1913 ) was a french biblical scholar and pre-raphaelite expert . he is noted for his theory on inscriptions . he is also the author of the faculté de littérature philosophique de l'occident ( 1894 ) , a book that is considered the bible of the phenomenological school of phenomenology , now known as the phenomenological school of applied cognitive psychology .


== life ==
joseph-marie gent was born in saint-barthe , saxe-coburg-vienne , on 5 december 1838 . his father , a citizen of the same town , died in 1879 . his mother , marguerite guilherme gent ( née romain , c. 1820–1890 ) , was the daughter of an academy of sciences professor , french writer and politician , pierre-marie guilherme gent ( 1803–1867 ) and marguerite gérard guilherme gent ( 1829–1893 ) . in 1858 , they had two children . gent 's older brother , alain gent ( 1850–1916 ) , was also a professor of oriental languages and literature , while his younger brother , claude gent ( 1851–1893 ) , became the director of the pontifical biblical commission , which helped enforce the no-canons of the apostles and synoptists .
after the fall of napoleon , louis xviii appointed the planemaker to use his influence to improve the university system at which the protestant theologian louis faller was a professor of theology and philosophy . after his retirement in 1880 , gent worked as a private tutor in toulouse until his death , on 10 march 1913 .


== philology ==
in the first quarter of the twentieth century , gent 's theory of inscriptions , called `` chabrierism `` , was integrated into cognitive psychology , and subsequently developed as part of its theory of mental grammar . it is now referred to as `` gent 's theory of the aramaic inscription. `` gent defined the aramaic inscription as the connecting text between the printed book of genesis and the text of the old testament . in part i , part ii and part iii of the work , he presents the basic principles of greek grammar and analysis of scriptural evidence for the biblical authorship of the hebrew and greek-speaking languages . in this book , gent also defines the origins of the biblical inscriptions and provides the historical basis for jewish and arab interpretations of the tablets .


== influence ==
jewish historians for the most part stated that the scrolls were subsequently interpreted in three main ways : they were first revealed to daniel by a revelation from god ( genesis 2:19–22 ; psalms 102:1–4 ) ; the god used the greek alphabet in their creation and their descriptions of animals and plants ( leviticus 19:11–23 ; deuteronomy 14:21–33 ; deuteronomy 22:22 ) ; and god was the inventor of the printing press ( deuteronomy 22:20–22 ) . from an essay on the grammar of the holy scriptures , with an emphasis on the aramaic-speaking languages , by joseph-marie gent , translated by james b. barclay ( 1893 ) , jews themselves interpreted the biblical text in the three basic ways . these three interpretations resulted in the establishment of the aramaic scriptural unity , which jews continued to use in the middle of the nineteenth century .
gent was not the first scholar to use scriptural allegory , but he was the first to be interested in the symbolism of the hebrew language . therefore , his work inspired freud to write `` der mensch : einführung zur semiticen literatur `` , the first large-scale study of semitic language symbolism in 1900 , through which he synthesized the concepts of freud and gent . subsequent authors of critical work on the scriptural language and philosophy of the prophetic writers include ernst clauer , friedrich ratzinger , abraham scheiner and otto hüllner .

carl friedrich hans breiber von breiber von breiber ( 16 april 1722 – 21 january 1807 ) was an austrian composer , pianist and historian .


== early life ==
he was born at borgo moravell , near leopoldstadt , and studied music and at the conservatory in vienna under alexander steiner . breiber became close friends with the young heinrich spengler . both were offered positions at the vienna academy of music , and breiber studied under spengler at the same time as henrik ibsen .


== career ==
he began composing in 1740 , and held the position of composer from 1750 until 1759 , his last five years as soloist at the grand concerts of vienna . breiber was one of the first composers to abandon the use of liturgical music in his music . breiber composed some popular music , but mostly works that were expurgated by the nazis after the end of the third reich .
he published only one orchestral work , a light symphonic poem entitled natg . iennennus , in 1760 . later , he composed a few cello concertos and small instrumental works . he also wrote a collection of poems , which were published as letters to mr. julius kober.in 1765 , he composed the longest sonata , and the first chamber music in german language , the sonata for cello and piano . breiber died in vienna in 1807 .


== works ==
breiber composed some pieces and choral works . although his own compositions are often bitter critical , the overt and incidental orchestration in his symphonies , sonatas , and suites ( on which he was praised for their complex harmonics ) are still rather influential ; the way his music is carried with a high sense of humour makes it easy for listeners to follow .
breiber 's best known composition is probably the roman cadenza ( 1811 ) , which bears his name . it is a complex 7-movement choral with choral melodies written in modal meter , and opuses of a dramatic mood.he was also a student of johann sebastian bach , and was fascinated by his chamber music .


== family ==
the breiber family were of noble-born descent . carl breiber was the eldest son . one of his brothers , frederick wirbel , was also a composer . their parents were bernd leopold breiber ( 1726-1776 ) , a minister ; his father was a canon of the benedictine cathedral in vienna , and his mother was a tailor . a nephew , carl anthony breiber ( 1730-1796 ) , a piano pedagogue , and other relatives survived him .

from 1893 to 1896 , he held a fellowship at the hudson institute and served as its director . during this time , waggoner began a political career as a conservative republican . he served as state treasurer for northern new york from 1900 to 1905 and was a member of the legislature from 1883 to 1894 .
at that time , the federal reserve act of 1913 , which prohibited the use of government securities to fund speculation , was well under way , and these restrictions would become known as the waggoner act , named after george waggoner . waggoner served as the superintendent of the federal reserve bank in 1913–1914.a key figure in the funding of the federal reserve system was edgar p. adler . waggoner and adler jointly purchased $ 10 million of government notes from adler 's blue eagle savings & loan in 1894 , thus contributing about one third of the total to the u.s. government 's business holdings during that time .
when the federal reserve system was created , the institute served as the lender to the federal reserve banks . waggoner is generally credited with the founding of the institute as a center for research , `` an independent . self-governing agency , organized by the president , who is solely responsible for its organization `` . he was a delegate to the meeting of the american economic association in chicago in 1914.waggoner 's rule became so troublesome that in 1918 , he resigned from his financial support role to richard cobden . he had long been an advocate for the education of the general public in the true meaning of the first and fourteenth amendments , and helped to establish charter schools in oakland and buffalo .

jean bibrel ( 4 may 1865 in paris – 10 september 1931 in boulogne-sur-mer ) was a french educator and political scientist .


== biography ==
jean bibrel was born in paris , but his father in liège was out of work . jean was apprenticed to a bookseller , but his father died , and his father 's last words before leaving the house were : `` la lui-même ! mais qu'elle est pas ? `` — `` i 'm not good enough to do it , ma'am ! `` then he married m. villette , and returned to paris .
one evening , while he was holding his second marriage license , bernard bernardi knocked on his door , and addressed him thus : `` mayor , please come to the hall ; it is about time you got an education ! `` he requested that the family should meet at a prix raisonné with a jewish associate , and that he should be allowed to present his gift . bernard continued to meet in the days following : `` ... from 1871 , at each election bernard bernardi gave , with every birthday until 30 august 1924 , to the jewish youth group , a set of four votes for légion d'honneur , of which i was one of the leaders , to benefit the m. israel society . i was elected first in the best classes of my class at 1871 , when ten students of the same class submitted a nomination for voco , and i became second in that class that year , when twenty students submitted a nomination for it . ``
during the times when several large delegations of the community appeared on stage to present their annual tribute to the king ( which some of the students of whom took part had received by subscription , only to be robbed of them in one blow by a terrorist ) to pay tribute to the old man , he never failed to attend . he never again voted against a bill which the king proposed , as such was illegal and seemed likely to give the authorities severe bad press . this was due to bernard 's participation in demonstrations with the youth group to be held to mark the 15th anniversary of the second ban of the kippah , when the whole school was attacked . he lost his sight and could not see well at night , so the jewish brothers rosa , yves , and abraham jacob had to let him walk in the darkness with them . he also wrote some notables , which came to be known as the `` `` lucy peace kit `` .

during the 1913 edition of the commune as `` commune b `` , a mémoire he had written for the magazine called `` révision du péri , `` was published in which he condemned `` the initiative of a smaller number of those working to take part in the decrees of the 1848 trial and of the anarchists who participated in the brouhaha that followed. ``


== major scientific publications ==
at the age of 21 he published his société détermination du droit , à la revolution des république françaises , a text on the causes of the revolution and the social situation of france . among his other works , a major book on the economic problem , published in 1924 , was le calmet vogue ; a book about trade unions . in the 1940s , he produced la baize et l'éducation ( bread and democracy ) , an influential expression on the present crisis and the law on labor organization.in 1954 he published in addition to his works les fifthes parties , un trois légions ? , and la ménagère et la fraternité d'une nouveau republic , a history of france in the fifth ( 1848–1918 ) . in 1958 , he published n'importante pas un islame ? ( the india question ? ) .
in 1930 , bibrel published a biography of rousseau , la duchesse de rousseau , in french : hilaire belloc , présence de la duchesse d'euripée , republished in 1960 .

konstantin alexandrovich belousov ( russian : никола́й се́ра́вич ма́йсов ; october 11 , 1881 in grigorije – october 8 , 1965 in moscow ) was a russian psychoanalyst , a famous expert in the field of sexual repression .


== biography ==
belousov began his psychoanalytic studies at the university of moscow where in 1908 , with konstantin illisov , he became a professor of psychoanalysis . he became in 1911 his chief assistant . belousov married margarita milyuva in 1914 , the couple having two daughters . his great love , though , was his wife , his own mother-in-law whose opinion greatly influenced the way he carried out his own work . a sympathetic catholic , his life was marked with trouble as he was forced by his mother-in-law to escape to tiflis and from there to novorossiysk to avoid persecution by the bolsheviks . belousov again went to moscow to continue his psychoanalytic studies with charles eustachius and subsequently supervised a. v. kobyshev in tiflis .
in tiflis belousov came into contact with other prominent psychoanalytic figures in these first years of the 20th century ; lina shukhevna and anatole brodsky took on his lectures , while alexander trubetsky in grigorii and shlomi mirsky in novorossiysk followed suit . however , belousov would recall from his own experiences that the reaction of the opposite sex toward the personal man he viewed as oppressive was in contrast to what he perceived in the antisocial men .
the focus of belousov 's book sexuality and womanhood was not more than a reproach against an exclusive idea of sexual repression . under its influence , he also studied the psychology of denial , in which the ability to respond to pain is also considered one of the essential elements in healthy sexuality . belousov insisted that , while the response to painful experiences is certainly crucial to the development of the personality , the psychological response to the power of the opposite sex seems to be independent of it . moreover , belousov believed that the superiority of the individuals is due not to any inherent human defect but to the power exercised by the opposite sex in maintaining physical and mental inappropriateness , the replacement of erotic love with maternal affection , and by a reduction of the degree of privation at which man 's power is exercised by nature or the culture of the people .
the book of homosexuality for the diagnostic of homosexuality in the 21st century was written after belousov 's death .

== early life ==
born in copenhagen in 1861 , rénheim was the son of a teacher and the uncle of mathematician and physicist frederik rénheim ( 1809–1898 ) . rénheim studied chemistry at the university of copenhagen , from which he graduated in 1882 with a degree in mechanical engineering . he worked as a chemist in the munitions factory of chemikbladet until 1885 , when he became a physics teacher . during his earlier years he also worked as a glass-blower . in the beginning of the 1890s he published two papers , on dyes and melting points , on melting-points of iron and glass and on thermal constants . the second paper was received mainly with considerable praise .


== career ==
in 1896 rénheim was hired by the university of copenhagen as a laboratory teacher and theoretical physicist . in 1908 he was promoted to the position of professor . rénheim was also the organiser of the intercalation-ringing-concert which occurred from may 1896 to may 1903 in copenhagen . the conference was attended by a multitude of luminaries and distinguished personalities , including later nobel prize winner august schleyer , the writer pierre teilhard de chardin and e.g . ludwig boltzmann , who had worked with rénheim in the same laboratory . rénheim was the director of the institute which became the international institute for polar-temporal experimental research .
he became a member of the royal danish academy of sciences in 1922 , the royal danish academy of engineering in 1925 , and the danish academy of sciences in 1932.in 1897 he discovered the rené i. schneider krigesling ( rené i. schneider–schurmeyer effect ) that allows to distinguish a particular type of fluid from any other type in a liquid state . the value is 0.53 m2/s2 . in 1927 he published a new differential equation on dyads , which still survives . it is a function of the dispersion coefficient , known as the rené i. schneider krigesling function . it explains a phenomenon occurring in anodes , cathodes and perforations . the most important limitation of this variable is that it is effectively a differential equation that depends only on the dispersion coefficients . other types of liquids require a formula that can be derived from the rené i. schneider krigesling function . this is the formula of the rené i. schneider particle density function .


== legacy ==
the rené i. schneider krigesling and rené i. schneider–schurmeyer-effect are widely used in glaciology.the national museum of denmark holds rené i. schneider 's laboratory equipment as well as physics instruments in its archives .

pedro xavier de souza da silva ( 1911 – 20 january 2003 ) was a brazilian meteorologist . he is considered a pioneer in explaining the 1997 tropical cyclones in south america ( cunr ) .


== early life ==
pedro xavier de souza was born on 10 june 1911 in the family of alfresco cattle ranchers in rio de janeiro , brazil . his parents were also religious , joão luis and joaquina pedro.in 1917 , he was admitted to the rio de janeiro state university . as a student , he was asked by professor pedro castro alves to do a work on meteorology . after completing his course , he was invited to join the weather section of the brazilian weather bureau .


== weather bureau , meteorology department ==
on the recommendation of alves , he went to work at the bureau and started investigating the consequences of the 1893 cyclones , which hit south america . he helped predict the cyclones in the u.s. as well as brazil . in september 1896 , he joined the meteorological department of the bureau . he was the first man in brazil to be named head of the meteorological section .
during his time in the weather department , he gave up his studies to concentrate on the weather observations .
on 4 november 1928 , a cyclone of the magnitude 2 struck são joão ( capital of minas gerais state in brazil ) , where de souza was stationed .
in 1932 , he was promoted to senior meteorologist .


== demonstration of a cyclone ’ s motion that lasted for hundreds of miles ==
during the year 1936-37 , de souza continued to make calculations on the motion of a cyclone , but was unable to observe any motion . for the first time , he made measurements on the motion of the cyclone 's surface . the motion was observed by gustavo cid in são paulo in 1938 . in 1939 , de souza published the results of his observations on the motion of a cyclone which lasted for around a dozen kilometers . the measurements showed that the motion of the cyclone had continued for more than a hundred kilometers for more than 10 kilometers , in contrast to most of the movements observed in the early or mid 19th century . with the help of such observations , de souza began work to explain the unusual motion of the 1995 tropical cyclones in south america .
during 1940 , he contributed to research into the solar hypothesis which proposes that the motion of a super-cyclone is the result of two factors : a sunspot group and its mass .


== weather manipulation ==
from 1936 to 1938 , de souza worked as an aide of cid at the institute of meteorology of the national research council , the department of meteorology of the brazilian government .
he helped with the calculation of cloud speed and variability . during 1938 , he became a weather bureau volunteer for the agricultural research institute , in brasilia , where he was assigned to their aerosol research and development department . as a volunteer , he was sent to several observatories in the united states , such as the jet propulsion laboratory and the national weather service of the united states . from 1942 to 1948 , he worked as meteorologist and educator in the weather departments of the spanish navy .
he was the director of meteorology and the division director for several years , until his retirement .
in 1954 , he helped design and build a weather station near the recently built rio indio airport .
he is one of the creators of the international association for applied meteorology ( iam ) .


== death ==
he died on 20 january 2003 in busão , são paulo , brazil .

= julius liotke =
julius liotke ( also antonius liotke , julius maximilian schmitz , and augustus von liotke ) ( 1 april 1760 – 9 january 1812 ) was a german linnaean geographer and biologist .


== life ==
liotke was born in stettin . as a boy , he studied geology at the university of berlin ( from 1785–1789 ) . he then studied medicine at the university of zürich ( from 1797–1803 ) , and at yale ( from 1803–1809 ) .
from 1804 to 1809 he was the schoolmaster of erlangen , studying geology , zoology and botany . in 1810 he became professor of botany at the university of liège .
in 1811 , he published an extensive treatise entitled über alten nordland aus sich den aarau , and wrote scientific articles on certain other phenomena of the alps . he became secretary of the historical society of liège . he was an opponent of thiers 's law , which operated to slow the growth of industry.he died in liège on 9 january 1812 , aged 65 .


== contributions ==

liotke discussed many topics , of which geography is a prime example . one of his notable contributions is his map on the island of süd and the adjacent fields of the southern österreich . he described the island on 16 august 1812 in a series of articles in the “ provincial of liège ” journal , and published the `` island of süd `` in a memoir ( in liège dialect ) published in 1814 in two volumes , containing many descriptions of land , lakes , trees , and much more .
liotke divided geographical units into geographical grades , and therefore between the seven chief centers of the high geography of europe , or the six-level arc ; and gave the state of all the higher grades of this arc in 1812 . liotke assigned so-called “ treelike ” time periods to certain stations : 1811 , 1811/12 , 1812 , 1814 .
liotke said that the old district of süd was found first in the mountains of the smiler basin . this is close to the friesian alps , and can also be found to a lesser extent by way of the übrenberg river valley , where the age of the earth had begun long before the norse-saxon ( possibly phoenician ) age . ( this would mean that fries'mountains , and the appropriate mountains of hesse , saxony and baden-württemberg , were probably younger than ancient fries ) . it is then located within the westerly part of the österreich .
liotke also wrote a volume on one of the weimar districts , where , according to his contemporary rüdiger halbherr , the study of geology was rewarded with a prosperous career and life . ( liotke 's five-year-old son , artur , used to go to school there daily in 1810 , and worked on a meteorological instrument . ) liotke viewed the geography of the weimar zone as integral to the development of the culture .
liotke considered as a centre of fauna ( all species ) in the sea a region of territory up to the danube river , and that of terrestrial vegetation from lakes , the greatest of which he also defined as the bennea-bad-wagen .
he defined the swiss gannet as the home of thousands of ducks or geese.according to a source , liotke took his name from the legendary “ julius caesar ” , son of the argonauts ( den jakob de jujans , il joms den kündens julius , e. y. glawson ) who became a greek colony in the crimea . after the war , caesar succeeded in restoring his noble rank , and followed in the path of his father 's descendants .

nikolaos tsatsoulineas ( hungarian : δικολός θυάριος ; 8 october 1741 – 11 october 1820 ) was a hungarian entomologist and plant collector .
tsatsoulineas first began collecting in the silesian mountains near the town of berzelinyi in 1772 . he later traveled to cretaceous times and collected insects and plants from large regions around the balkan peninsula . beginning in 1776 , tsatsoulineas explored the cretaceous formation , collecting plant material , insects , molluscs and invertebrates as well as fossils .
his main focus was botany , especially several taxa of the order apis . in 1821 tsatsoulineas discovered about 6,000 specimens from silesian hydrocarbon deposits . however , the remains of m. boiziensis ( the pitcher plant ) are thought to be a contribution from tsatsoulineas'earlier work in that year .
many of the crustaceans and worms collected by tsatsoulineas had later been described by johannes von laberdijk .
from 1782 to 1814 , tsatsoulineas was a professor of zoology at the royal school of the arts in budapest .
his collections were destroyed during world war i but fragments of the research collections in the university 's museum and several of his research specimens survived and were brought to budapest to be studied . tsatsoulineas died in 1820 and was interred in the friedterkirchenhof . he is commemorated in the name of a species of edible lizard , cotesia iniacea ( today cotesia verdeana , probably the species described by tsatsoulineas ) .

= nathaniel moore =
nathaniel moore ( 28 october 1729 – 3 may 1811 ) was an english quaker , theologian and missionary in the new world .
he is remembered chiefly as the author of one of the earliest english translations of a german hymn to the sacred heart .


== life ==

moore was born in london , the eldest son of john moore ( 1710–1788 ) , by his first wife , anne robertson ( 1708–1760 ) . after studying at the king 's school , he passed the bar , and in 1752 entered the london botanic garden under sir robert dalton . moore married catherine willcox of sandhurst , kent , on 4 march 1756 , with whom he had no children . he returned to london the following year .
he was a calvinist and associated himself with thomas kish , robert elliot and john balfour .
in 1757 he set out to make journeys through liberia , tamaulipas and sierra leone . he had reported in 1758 on the issues of whoredom in the colony ; his report of this journey was a misfire . while undertaking this , he lost his ear , and so had to learn to speak with a cane . in 1758 , he wrote london and other notes on the dominicans , and the poor man 's gospel of st. john . he followed the same route in 1759 and in the following year was carried to geneva by a danish vessel , the rondeau grampus . he died there , 1811 .
moore developed a theory of chinese protestantism , developed by j.f . smith in his 1761 book the origin of the chinese church , that the theory was first stated in 1759 by rev . nicholas cooper , and partly retold by j.h . martin . moore seems to have discovered the actual `` ancient church `` of china , one which predates the emperor of the ming dynasty by over four centuries .
according to moore 's theory , the use of money was associated with the very earliest pentecostal ( evangelical ) protestantism in china . thus , moore suggests that the practice of one coin on the day of pentecost ( fuhuan ) was a monetary substitute for one formerly issued by the first opium commission ( named the chinese tong dynasty commission ) in 1600.moore , like other early nineteenth-century english quaker missionaries , translated the great holy theotokos into the malay language , and was well-acquainted with the great chinese hermit hui . he also wrote english versions of the chinese chuan in two volumes , five years after the translation of the great theotokos had begun .
moore 's own prose works are poorly known . in 1770 , thomas doggett , in his `` life of nathaniel moore `` ( london , 1770 ) , relates how moore produced `` some noblest of all songs . of pure beauty and by power of perverseness of writing , very learned and genteel sounding of rhetoric and profound exposition , containing a collection of glorious tales which are to every ears that worthy and pious apothecary he 's especially desirous to have written ; some of them may be now fitly taken to be authorized histories ... allusions , allegories , poetry , history , games , military narrative , romance , comedy , .... ``

hilberg received his doctorate from the university of basel in 1907 . from 1910 to 1918 he worked as an assistant to bernhard speller at the university of heidelberg . in 1920 he received a doctorate from the university of berlin , and became a professor in 1928 . he was posthumously elected a foreign member of the royal society in 1935 . he was a member of the french academy of sciences and the german academy of sciences and leopoldina .
in the early years of the twentieth century hilberg argued for two main arguments against histamine hypothesis : that histamine is poorly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa , and that histamine could only be passed through lipolytic phospholipases which prevent the oxidation of histamine .
he suggested that inflammation can be a major source of gastrointestinal malabsorption ( exudates ) , that tumors predispose the intestines to increased myelination , and that exudates are discharged by overlying muscles , similar to that produced by the passage of saliva through the mouth into the pharynx .
he also proposed the microhistoritay hypothesis , where histamine can be more easily formed by the metabolism of `` phobias `` and discomforts .


== selected publications ==
he was director of the innsbruck university of medical science ( 1937–1942 ) and was then assistant professor of anatomy and histology at the university of tübingen ( 1942–1946 ) .

= mark youmans =
mark youmans ( 15 november 1904 – 8 january 1989 ) was an american immunologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of the immune system of the cornea .


== early years ==
youmans was born in cleveland , ohio . he received his b.a . in biochemistry from the university of chicago and his ph.d. in immunology from johns hopkins university in washington , d.c.in 1947 , youmans and frank feynman developed the rubinstein test , which is used to determine whether an antibody produced by the skin of a human being is soluble in aqueous solutions . ( it may be possible to isolate two different types of igg , but the test can only detect binding-specific igg of only one type . ) when assessing how well antibodies bind , weinstan adds `` that one of the important parts of the assay , but not the whole thing , is that there is never enough assays to determine in practice the exact affinity of the antibodies for different types of molecules `` . [ 1 ]


== teaching career ==

at johns hopkins , youmans was the driving force behind teaching immunology in the school of biochemistry and medicine . in 1953 , when johns hopkins merged with the johns hopkins university to form the university of maryland , he headed the newly created immunology department . in 1954 , youmans became associate director of the center for immunology and laboratory biology , and four years later , his team won the nobel memorial prize in chemistry . he was elected a foreign member of the royal society in 1955 .


=== immunology research ===

youmans is best known for his research on the antigens produced by the cornea , in collaboration with colleagues l. w. and j. harrison , who later became colleagues in the cornea development research center at johns hopkins . [ 2 ] there , they worked to understand what parts of the cornea were involved in the production of the antibodies .
they also distinguished between the monoclonal antibody-producing cells and a heterogeneous group of immune cells that consisted of blood cells and an immune lining called the t-cell differentiation cascade , which they later named youmans cells . they were particularly interested in the abc of monoclonal antibodies , which in contrast to antibodies produced from blood , is a specific peptide that does not bind directly to a surface . in 1954 , youmans developed a test for the detection of cd41 , the peptide that labels the abc of an antibody , and the result was a paper on abc-positive cells and an accompanying text explaining that the results were due to slight differences in antigen binding to their abc . in 1958 , youmans was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for this work.during these years at johns hopkins , youmans also published about ten papers that added to the knowledge of t-cell function . together with l. w. harrison , youmans developed an antibody against shigella and by 1966 , the findings established that the antibodies do in fact bind to the own antigen of shigella , thereby contributing to defining the importance of the staining technique and of white blood cells . [ 3 ]


=== death ===
mark youmans died of meningococcal infection , a type of pneumonia .


== selected books ==
one of the books youmans edited , which was published posthumously by the the johns hopkins university press , was written in collaboration with s. b. meade and c. l. marsh , who had been working together in an alphabetical index of microbial antigens.another of the books youmans edited , published posthumously by the the johns hopkins university press , is the standard text on the immunology of the human cornea . youmans 's other books include the immunity bowel , discovering the heart , and the neglected world of the antibody .

jacques-louis agard ( 28 november 1860 – 2 august 1949 ) was a french zoologist who discovered in 1876 that the human digestive tract contained a mucus layer rich in amoebae . this discovery was the start of a successful modern field of research of amoebozoans .


== biography ==
born in boulogne-sur-mer , agard studied at the paris natural history museum and the école normale supérieure . while an instructor at the école normale supérieure , agard observed during 1888 in a field trip to la chapelle de crécy an example of autolytic amoeba , a group of small amoebic larvae containing the larvae of euterpe and trichogrammatode . he discovered that the larvae of euterpe , which are generally not eaten in this country , contain the chameleon larvae for feeding , and in the presence of lacustrine eggs , the larva begins to develop into autolytic amoebae and in 1886 discovered autolytic amoebae in a small swamp .
from 1889 , he taught at the école de chimie des sciences sur la france . in 1895 he returned to his native town and published in french the findings of his excavation at the salle de la loire on the island of antigua . the work was important for science in his home country because the absence of any proof of entomological distinctions between the species was brought to light . the work was widely studied and proved that it was the oral bacteria of coccidia which were the cause of skin disease . agard was the first european to distinguish the toxins produced by coccidia from its protozoa . ( this experiment was later dubbed the agard-aspirin–bototropis experiment . )
as a distinguished scientist , agard became a close friend and associate of botanist auguste lamarck .
he became professor at the ecole polytechnique and the chair of zoology at the same university ( 1958–1961 ) , but his first scientific published work on amoebae was in 1903 . the bibliography for these papers is widely available at the amazon in mémoires sous l ’ académie des sciences et naturelles de france , annuel de l ’ université de strasbourg , du règne fondation , bibliothèque bibliothèque des sciences et des arts naturales et le départements du méditerranée ( published on 16 december 1913 by g.-m. coté ) .
in 1904 , agard worked for 3 years on experiments involving the growth of a host by means of a broiler . his first published paper on this subject was `` zur differentiationkunde der vertebrateen `` ( on the development of the embryo in fishes ) . in the same year he became a fellow of the royal swedish academy of sciences .

= barbara straus =
barbara straus ( january 19 , 1917 – september 6 , 2007 ) was an american sociologist . she was awarded an honorary phd from the university of california at berkeley in 1978 . she is widely known for her studies on the nature of gender and the social and cultural environment of women . straus has written widely on the effects of women 's social roles and on the history of feminism .


== biography ==


=== education ===
straus was born in langford , maine on january 19 , 1917 . she graduated from the university of maine in 1934 . she married benjamin straus , a political scientist , in 1937 . they have one son , joel straus .


=== career ===
straus was a social scientist at berkeley . she lectured at stanford university for over 35 years before leaving to become a professor of sociology at ub . in 1961 , she and her husband moved to washington , d.c. to join the women 's policy research center ( wprc ) , working there for five years until her death . she would leave a journal called `` division of woman in economics , `` which she published with her husband and which was the first peer-reviewed journal to explore women 's economic roles . this article discusses a few of her findings , and concludes that `` differential impact and development of educational environments in economic lifetimes of women and men 's siblings `` can contribute to a `` relational dynamic that is true of women in families. `` she is also credited with providing the first approach to promoting gender equality as a social value in economic field studies , and examining `` the value of women on the laboring class and on the factory floor `` .


=== opinions ===
straus 's research with wprc was influential , not only in the development of women 's rights as a community ideal , but also in the development of educational funding and policies for women in academia . straus was a supporter of the student women 's movement and would influence women activists in the field of gender studies in both the united states and in canada . one of her main critiques of the effects of student activism on the academic environment was that what was difficult in the classroom was rarely common in the boardroom , which is why it was so important to get public support for these social change efforts .
straus was also highly critical of social expectations of women in the study of labor and women ’ s social roles . she noted that the requirements for `` equitable treatment `` in school gave women no clear positions to fulfill , and that schools `` should be places that foster new standards rather than impose new standards. `` she said that `` instead of discouraging early college graduates from pursuing meaningful careers , these standards should be used in their place , encouraging vocational careers instead of awarding awards to honor high school graduate placement . `` additionally , straus said , with a class large enough to teach history , in her opinion , it is necessary for women ’ s studies ’ more than ever to ask what women ’ s potential for economic success and achievement is . straus is also an advocate of women ’ s as social and economic subjects , noting that it can help women ’ s voices and careers.in the end , straus said , the most important research her book has to offer is the value that academic disciplines may offer to social research . while she acknowledges that this value is seldom recognized in the academy and often offered only to one side , straus takes particular issue with the rejection of labor studies by social scientists , and the unwillingness of women and men to use empirical science for class purposes . she believes that such problems can be solved by acknowledging that intellectual and moral struggle is possible . thus , she believes that a study ’ s importance should be assessed by what it offers to the broad community .

= john barnes ( painter ) =
john barnes ( 31 july 1779 – 11 april 1856 ) was an english preacher and churchman known for his work on the architecture of the roman catholic church .


== life and career ==
in 1778 , barnes was born to his family in bristol , england . his father was a surgeon . in 1782 , barnes entered christ 's college , cambridge , and proceeded to study medicine under dr james fuller , leaving to study architecture . he gained an ll.b . in 1793 , and after two years spent at christ 's , he went to england .

john randall ( 1812–1881 ) was a methodist methodist theologian who argued that the belief in `` co-creator `` must be limited to the theistic arguments against theism , not a concession to theistic materialism . randall believed that being a true christian was a matter of living in the world in which god created , and he asserted that each believer had a certain degree of responsibility for the acts of his or her life . randall taught that human history is the product of events that are actively participating in god 's creative efforts , with the occasional exception of miracles and the fall . randall contended that the primary sin of man is his failure to do the will of god.randall was a prolific writer , publisher , and teacher . in addition to many books , seven of which he wrote independently , he also wrote several well-known hymns and a prophetic work , the oration , or spirit commentary , which was published under the pen-name john randall in 1841 . his hymns are among the earliest known christian musical compositions , and few modern composers have adopted his ideas . he was appointed professor of theology at the university of michigan in 1889 and his style was studied in the philosophy department of clark university , with a dissertation on classical rhetorics entitled the philosophy of matthew . randall taught in clark university 's college of arts and sciences and as a professor and examiner of grammar and rhetoric at clark university 's college of philosophy from 1892 to his death in 1925 . he was the editor of the principles of logic , a compilation of controversial theological ideas from the standpoint of metaphysics , moral theology , and aesthetics ; a commentary on the late assyrian-hebrew prophet idušah ( 1838 ) ; a work that dealt with amraphel ; a tract entitled problems of deism ( 1867 ) ; and , in 1870 , the acclaimed canterbury confession of faith ( entitled words with divine inspiration ) .in 1849 , john quincy adams and a group of students read an article in the christian century by randall . randall replied with an article published in the progress magazine that discussed the free play of the mind in god 's providence . randall was among the three co-founders of the improvement era in 1854 , published by a fellow student , prof. thomas jefferson davis , in part because of his strong public rhetoric and his beliefs in `` the doctrine of divine co-creature `` . randall 's american version of the new testament was published as a pamphlet in 1857 and he also wrote several prolific sermons . randall taught theology at michigan for two decades , from 1891 until his death in 1925 , and he was also an occasional correspondent for the new york times and american age . randall was also a major contributor to the journal the christian century , often commenting on controversial topics , and he contributed to the work of a number of newspapers , as well as for his lectures at clark university and at the clark library.randall and his wife , mary a. phelps , had four sons , including a son , daniel r. randall , who served in the navy during world war ii . in addition to his popular evangelical sermons and hymns , randall wrote two shorter poems , and a series of articles and books , and authored or contributed numerous other books . he was also a well-known merchant and cooper and published his own music ( `` cornish concerto `` ) and music for church music ( `` beethoven 's medallion suite `` ) . randall died on december 24 , 1925 , at oak park , michigan , after a brief illness .

peacock was a leading student of nikolai popov and worked on its theoretical , practical , and practical applications in rocketry .


== early life and education ==
aleksandr aleksandrovich peacock was born on february 5 , 1918 , in slavyansk , ukraine . in 1938 , he graduated from leningrad institute of engineering physics in ukraine . then in 1940 , he moved to the united states , where he was a researcher at the st. louis physical laboratory of the university of missouri and at the national research institute of systems technology and engineering ( nistes ) of the united states . he also taught at the university of illinois , where he was then professor of the meteorology and oceanography . in the same year , peacock was also a professor at the institute of physics of the joint institute of technology of varna , the hebrew university of jerusalem and the institute of education and career research of the moscow technical university .


== career ==
aleksandr makayevich peacock was given the commission to design and launch a spaceplane called the proton rocket after popov 's unfulfilled predictions . later , he would also develop a small winged rocket .
peacock 's nasa-funded project was called triatomic - launching an electron-positron accelerator at nimh , . so far , in early 1965 , the first test flight of the world 's first full-scale triatomic particle accelerator , called
comet whiz , took place at the delta-v facility at anderson air force base , florida . it was an attempt to study neutrinos .
around the same time , peacock developed and operated one of the first satellite-mounted pulsed ion accelerators in history , called the pcm-51 . the measurement of energy discharge induced the first detection of a neutrino , the gamma rays , in cosmic rays .
peacock then continued his work on the traveling rail . he was the first to demonstrate the geomagnetic pulsed electromagnetic accelerator with a laser . peacock built this laser-based experiment , operated it on the cape canaveral air force station on the florida cape , and measured neutrinos in the system . he was the first to use this device at one-fifth the energy as previously known . however , peacock 's calculations about the effects of physics around pulsed electromagnetic accelerators were only applicable to the stationary system .
in 1967 , peacock and the college of engineering of the moscow institute of physics , moscow , became the pioneers of high-energy synchrotron physics . this allows physicists to measure complex phenomena like the spectrum of the weak nuclear force , x-ray activity and many other phenomena .
in 1976 , he became head of the department of physics of the institute of experimental physics of the communist party of the soviet union , and then became its director from 1980 to 1988 . he then returned to the soviet union .

charles karl köster ( 18 november 1881 – 14 january 1965 ) was a swedish economist who served as a professor of economics at the university of chicago from 1924 to 1961 . the university of chicago is named in his honor .


== early years ==
charles karl köster was born in kolmasen , and studied at the department of economics of the swedish imperial university in köthen , from which he graduated with a doctorate in 1927 . his doctoral work was entitled `` uppenbarne statistischer societas förförbundskola veränderelserelse statistiska experimentationer aktive selning som världsktningen `` ( the legal institutions of a statistical state experiment . the research into a social state experiment ) . the first translation of the book into swedish into english was published in 1930 , following a reprint .


== career ==
köster had originally studied at a college in stockholm . as a result , he became acquainted with carl menger . both , he and the kaiser 's health insurance company , knaurer , tried to organize the swedish socialists to obtain a much-needed strike . but despite a refusal from the kaiser 's health insurance company , and difficulties obtaining insurance coverage from it , all attempts failed . köster , having found the scientific methods used by menger ’ s work and is now using those methods himself , became acquainted with and a believer in the theoretical ideas of karl marx . karl marx himself , even at this early stage , had a close friend in köster . köster , like other progressives of the time , was also the president of the st. louis anti-saloon league . he had become a marxist and became an intellectual representative of the jacobin society .
in 1928 , the swedish social democratic party succeeded in becoming the governing party in sweden . köster left the social democratic party in 1934 , supporting the social democracy led by alfred nobel.in 1934 , the kaiser 's health insurance company ( jonsson skalbart ) was dissolved . swedish president of the swedish social democratic party-elect , gustaf godräther , wished to deal with the fallout from the dissolution of the health insurance company that they might get insurance from the state , and köster found the financial difficulties he encountered in köthen ( i.e. , for the time being , his salary as professor of economics ) overwhelming . köster spent two years on an unpaid research job at the lund university . he started a phd under the supervision of jonsson , which resulted in the production of a book entitled `` statistiska i världskonomiska analytiska statistiska experimenta ( theory of statistics and its applications ) . `` the book is perhaps the first serious attempt at understanding the causes of the great depression and what one can do about it .
köster remained in lund until 1937 when he obtained a chair in economic statistics at the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 2012 : new york : oxford university press , isbn 978-0-19-2033887-7 ) . there he studied the trend in the swedish market rate between 1906 and 1938 , and thus came to work on the development of a national inflation index . his theories about the nature of investment and unemployment , as well as about the economic impact of international trade , influenced the policy debate of the day . he was the co-founder and president of the aarhus school of economics in 1946 .
from 1948 to 1958 , köster served as a professor in the department of economics at the university of chicago ( 1947–1960 ) . he left the faculty to become a visiting professor in stockholm in 1960 , an arrangement which continues to this day . he died in 1965 .

= jan kepler ( physicist ) =
jan kepler ( july 17 , 1787 – july 3 , 1858 ) was a danish inventor of a device capable of producing highly infinitesimal amounts of electricity .


== life ==
he was born in denmark 's norden archipelago . during his teenage years , he studied natural sciences at the university of copenhagen . in 1817 , he joined the royal danish air force and later became a pilot .
in 1821 , he won a research prize from the government , for the invention of a motor and for the construction of a mercury thermometer for the british office-for-aids at the royal air force in copenhagen . he won the norwegian iron-nordische mikroghadet of the year 1824 , in 1826 , and in 1830 was named a member of the danish academy of sciences .
he investigated the phenomenon of thermal anomalies which caused lights , like candle-fires , to appear permanently on the ground .
in 1823 , he designed and built a portable steam engine with a temperature-sensing tube .
his paper ( in danish ) containing his experiments was `` über der thermünerstrahlen `` . he was not a natural scientist . in 1831 , he introduced heat at low temperatures , which he felt was not reliable . he also discovered a vast array of anomalies , some of them occurring on the geological scale . as the summer cooled down the anomalies become more evident . he found a way to counteract this problem by installing a constant amount of electric current in a cooling tube that stretched between two adjacent supports , one supporting a heated tube . the hypothesis was that an accidental current passing through the tube would be enough to set off the heat-sensitive reaction.in 1834 he designed a type of thermometer , one which could be both accurate and reliable . in 1835 , he built a large ammonia furnace which produced thermocouple emulsions in a vacuum chamber . by carefully separating these emulsions , he was able to measure a number of temperature changes . in this work , he also invented the first machine capable of accurately measuring the absolute degree of a temperature difference . this temperature-sensor apparatus was constructed by his colleague and friend johannes otto janssen , who named the janssen-kepler machine after him .
in 1843 he was awarded the royal swedish academy of sciences . he died in copenhagen on july 3 , 1858 . he is buried in the cemetery at buansag.while producing a thermometer , j.e . kepler was assisted in his research by andreas fick , the `` inventor of coffee `` .


== achievements ==
according to john foch and duncan mackenzie , while he was researching thermal anomalies , he also `` found to his great satisfaction the workings of a steam engine , and in fact , of a kind of invention much more rapid than any yet discovered by means of electricity `` .
his experiments include one in which `` several piles of coal were continually put in motion , at random , for a given time ... the engine nearly continually filled the furnace with the abundant fuel contained therein. `` his reaction time to the emitted pulses was a few milliseconds . at one point , his thermometer `` took a thousand seconds to climb from the vault of a chimney to the tail end of a burning log. `` the results of the experiments that he conducted ( e.g. , the one in the engleaving chamber ) were subsequently published .
on the previous work was also published an early account of his discovery : `` this discovery , of a means of reproducing exactly the images of the lightings of a view-screen in any given glass , has , it is to be hoped , been discovered and will probably be of great practical utility in directing treatment and setting up of the apparatus employed for this purpose `` .
his paper , `` über die jetszrationdichtung über die omeletkeit befinden `` ( 1830 ) was published in the `` annalen der naturforschenden `` ( a science journal in 1797 ) , which mentioned his discovery of thermal anomalies and the janssen-kepler machine . it is published in our archives in 1886-88 ( see archives section ) .

in 1908 he returned to halle , where in 1910 he became an assistant in a neurological clinic , a position he retained until his retirement in 1941 . in 1928 he was named director of the neuropsychiatric institute in schöneberg .
his career spanned several departments , including neurology , neurology and psychiatry , and he continued to work on the anatomical basis of dementia . he was also a psychobiologist who published a number of papers on the relationship of specific personality traits with neuronal processes .
he was deeply affected by the institutionalism of the nazi regime in germany , and later did not hesitate to express his displeasure with the conduct of medical doctors . wilhelms described psychiatric illness as `` the poorest form of manhood `` .
wilhelms died in göttingen in 1972 .


== work ==


=== brain : anatomy , physiology , and pathology ===
wilhelms ’ work concentrated on the anatomical basis of the brain and its connection with the nervous system . he studied the cerebral hemispheres : the ventricles , the pons , and the cerebral cortex.although wilhelms was an outspoken critic of pathological psychiatry , such as `` pathological psychology `` ( poulantz dasen et al . ) , with which he had a professional conflict , he had a very strong affinity for neuropsychiatry . wilhelms discussed with his student raymond wiedemann his views on neuropathology , commenting that “ there can be no disagreement as to the importance of the word neuropathology in the sense of a logical determination of physiological processes . ”


=== neurology ===
wilhelms also discussed neurophysiology , studying ocular corneal reflexes , and superatomy . his laboratory work was devoted to the quantification of oxygen consumption and their association with visual sensitivity . in 1897 he was awarded the verein für neurologie und physiologie zur allgemeine physiologie ( for one year ’ s assistance in comparative physiology ) .in 1913 , in the autumn semester of this year , wilhelms demonstrated for the first time that trigeminal nerves produced abnormal phototaxis in the eye , independently of the visual system ( reich et al . ) . in 1916 , wilhelms demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal and lingual nerves caused double vision . in 1918 , as part of his practice , wilhelms also performed neurochemical investigations on urea in the eye .


=== neuropsychology ===
wilhelms contributed to a number of areas of neuropsychology . he completed a comprehensive textbook on motorogy and physiology of the human nervous system in the 1890s , with additional articles in a series of books and monographs on sheep brain . he also wrote a major article in 1894 entitled `` on the structure of the vegetative state , `` published as the anatomy and physiology of consciousness in the new york world-telegram .
wilhelms coined the phrase `` misreading `` in neurology . he was an outspoken critic of the methodologies used by pathologists in their diagnosis of mental illness , and he viewed the current state of modern neuropsychiatry as having a progressive descent from a belief in innate , irreducible dissection .
wilhelms coined the phrase `` in utero stroke `` in 1910 .

mikhail grigoryevich churkin ( russian : никола́й приборникович азбриков ; 20 august 1852 , stalingrad – 26 july 1917 , moscow ) was a soviet designer and illustrator .


== biography ==
in 1865 , churkin started studying the ancient trade inscriptions in moscow . his study of russian inscriptions began the design of several books and magazines , which he made with the help of engravers and assistants , including pavel august wilhelm lopatin . by the time he died in 1917 , he had received over 50 works . he is one of the leading figures of the tradition of russian engraving . a famous landscape in old russia , for example , is a work in his style . the unique window on his own bookshop is considered a masterpiece of russian art and was dedicated to alexander nevsky . the window is commemorated with the slogan of his motto .


== views ==

churkin has taken an interest in the meaning of traditional designs and influenced designers in the soviet union and abroad . although he was one of the first to understand the value of designing `` greek in the design of the world `` ( see atlantico ) , he was not interested in connecting it with what were regarded as frivolous design trends , although there is great importance in the recent fascination with modernism in russia . he expressed his own desire for an aesthetic harmony between his traditional and the modern.churkin 's main aim was always to bring back the `` greek idea `` , while preserving the purity of the old styles .
as a `` modern `` artist , he was influenced by the increasing sophistication of nature and its fine quality of quality of the skin , especially the textile . he always thought about the appearance of the work , thought about color , and wanted to make works using realistic methods , and utilized material minimisation.these sensibilities shaped his views on the values of the masculine and feminine form in visual art . churkin was conscious of the need to show a distinctive beauty in everyday life , and opposed the ideal of `` a colour palette `` to the kind of `` an all-pervasive , monochrome regime `` which characterized the aesthetic of romanticism . in comparison with the classics of his time , he experimented with creating beautiful typography with minimalistic character - closer to his own and the preferred style of the day.churkin called for `` harmony between the product and the designer `` , and favored minimalism , sensuality and objectivity . his inclination toward the classical orientation is reflected in his influential book elements of textile design ( 1916 ) . the book was a necessary preface for the book publications by art and architecture and conceptual paper with selected drawings and texts of various clients .


== honors ==
among the many publications by his name is the series the gardenia or the heart of russia ( 1935 ) .
a couple of sports-game baskets with his artwork were created by the developers of the ens kvet hockey team .

several galleries in the moscow riam exhibit his and hers for the exhibition of oriental painting on the walls of the exhibition gallery churkin gallery .
in 1989 , unesco adopted the international name of `` churkin `` as a tribute to its authors and designers , and awarded him the `` ussr prize in the history of the arts `` .


== legacy ==
churkin 's was an acclaimed figure in modern russian art . his works from that period are popular with his younger generation , but he is still only an icon of his influence . his publishing works are mostly in the pattern-making and form-making area , and at the time of his death they had an enormous market value . his designs have been used as a reference for very long time .

arthur tanabe ( 植田 平 , atsuwa , september 13 , 1917 – march 19 , 1997 ) was a japanese molecular biologist and selenium researcher known for his work on this compound.tanabe studied chemistry at the tokyo imperial university . in 1928 he began work on selenium gas . he invented a solvent extraction method for the extraction of selenium and improved the technique . after his initial extraction , he isolated `` 疾合重 `` , or `` platinum from selenium `` , later known as selenium oxide . he is particularly noted for the x-ray emission from selenium , which he produced by using a single piece of aqueous oxygenated ferric chloride solution . his name became associated with this substance in 1937 and since then is known widely as `` tango `` .


== life and career ==
tanabe was born in niigata to a teacher and a janitor . after a severe illness , he transferred to niigata university school of medicine ( now hosei university ) in 1931 , and served as a researcher there from 1930 until 1946 . in 1946 he was admitted to a university research group . he began work as a research worker in mass spectrometry in 1946 . in 1949 he started teaching at the university in yokohama , where he became a senior fellow from 1951 to 1955 . in 1955 , he joined the newly founded science and technology institute at tokushima , tokyo . from 1956 to 1963 he was a professor at hosei university . he retired in 1964 and was awarded the iwanami reki mitsui prize in 1971 .
after tanabe 's death in 1997 , scientists and researchers who worked in the field were kept up to date with the latest developments in the field , as well as the customary honors and awards given to tanabe 's students.the majority of the work tanabe worked on was in the field of chemical synthesis . he is the namesake of aseptiform alga belonging to the sea anemone family , which , after a lengthy phase transition , once again became a type of phytoplankton .
the identification of the x-ray emission from tanabe 's x-ray diffraction data in the late 1950s sparked interest in the role of x-rays in life . apart from his work on x-ray emission , tanabe developed a novel technique for the extraction of selenium and , in 1958 , developed a leach-resistant ultraviolet-visible ( ldv ) analyzer that was subsequently used by several large companies worldwide .

== biography ==
albert wendel was born in austin , texas , the son of albert edward wendel and helen mary pearl brown . his parents both held some kind of public office . he graduated from the university of chicago and university of texas , where he earned a master 's degree in entomology in 1931 .
in 1931 , he was the first to collect the western species of the genus astroturroidae in the entomological museum of illinois . wendel was employed as a curator of field entomology for the leduc county naturalists'museum until 1933 . in the summer of 1933 , in response to reports of rapid , economic development in the area , the leduc county naturalists'museum was purchased by the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , under the direction of emmett c. hutchinson .
in 1934 , wendel , who was working as a plant entomologist at the leduc county naturalists'museum , initiated the multi-year series of field trips through illinois , indiana , and missouri to survey a region of up to 100,000 acres of prairie land . from 1936 to 1938 , the expedition included an experimental section along the missouri river in which museum scientists experimented with field corn . throughout the third of the year , the expedition also explored the central pacific ocean .
in 1939 , wendel returned to the leduc county naturalists'museum with several new species of the insects . the specimens were for identification by anatomy , taxonomy , and standard naming .
in 1941 , wendel was transferred to chicago to be full-time curator of field entomology at the natural history museum of chicago . he continued his field work with d. f. hall and allen w. nichols . during his time there , he met his wife , augusta , an ornithologist who was equally fascinated by natural history . with the outbreak of world war ii in 1941 , the museum was attacked by japanese bomb-carriers and the war scare forced the museum to close , leaving the plant section unoccupied .
during the period 1935-1945 , the wendel laboratory was destroyed by fires that caused extensive damage to the insect collection and his offices.during the course of the war scare , wendel arranged to have employees arrested for espionage by the united states government . he was arrested and sent to prison . he was released on february 1 , 1945 , by president truman . after his release , wendel was again offered a position with the chicago zoological gardens as head of their entomology department . wendel spent four years at the zoological gardens , this time teaching the first course in entomology , at the expense of his habilitation . he remained on the zoological gardens staff until 1947 , when he was promoted to associate professor . wendel served as head of the entomology department until his retirement in 1933 .

= louis richard lewis =
louis richard lewis ( may 18 , 1927 – may 19 , 2007 ) was an american statistician and statistician who pioneered the use of two measures of population growth , estimated bases of population growth and total fertility rate , for identifying the size of populations , which ultimately led to the abandonment of the metric of `` number of lives `` in the subsequent 20th century .


== biography ==
he was born on may 18 , 1927 in new haven , connecticut . his father , a civil engineer , was a pioneer of communication and traffic technology who was best known for his own invention of the telephone . he graduated from wesleyan university in 1955 . he was a founder of the american statistical association and was a member of the national academy of sciences . he was the lawrence h. hoover professor of statistics at johns hopkins university from 1967 until his retirement in 1995 .
lewis and douglas wolf in 1989 used the new universal report on demography ( urd ) to identify the united states as the world 's largest population producer , with the u.s. continuing to grow at approximately two times the rate of the world population . the revised urd 's successor , the world population prospects survey ( wpps ) was completed in 2007 and published in 2013 .


== career ==
in 1961 , lewis became a research associate with the united states army and later in 1965 he was a professor at the university of texas at austin . he was a founding member of the international institute for applied systems analysis ( iisaa ) and its predecessor , the international population division of the rockefeller foundation .
at the iisaa , lewis was an early advocate for greater flexibility in combining population estimates and series of tables to get a `` relative `` measure of a population 's size .
for one of his earlier contributions to the growth of the united states population , he showed that the world was rapidly growing on average by 0.008 percent per year from 1961 to 1965 . while this is less than the 0.2 percent needed to keep pace with its population growth ( a lack of `` real `` growth `` in the 1970s helped stall the last decade of progress , according to many scholars ) , it is at least 2 times faster than what was needed to keep pace with the changing nature of climate .
he has also argued for large scale over-simplification of data because this essentially disregards and ignores the sources of `` inefficient `` growth .
he served on the international institute for applied systems analysis.the macdowell chalmers award is named after lewis .

andrew hill glikson ( 1884–1952 ) was a canadian biologist and bacteriologist .


== life ==
glikson was born in truro , new brunswick , to frank harold and ada chahine glikson . he was the grandson of john b. and elizabeth glikson . glikson went on to study at the university of manitoba , graduating with a degree in botany . after completing his studies , he worked at the winnipeg botanical gardens as an assistant curator until 1932 , when he married the celebrated biologist ida rebecca mead.glikson 's work made him known in botanical circles as `` a champion in the experimental work that showed that plant viruses are being evolved by fungal mechanisms to assist microbial life as it grows , as well as other viruses `` . his work was being credited with demonstrating that viruses may in fact act in a similar way to the active ingredient in tobacco smoke , flavoring the plant with flavin . following this work , andrew mead joined him to work on the bio-directives of the plant viruses that are referred to as shigella and vesicular stomatitis . he also began work on viruses that were a part of the re-establishing of the germ plasm of archaea . for the final years of his life , glikson 's laboratory was dedicated to biological research , which included plant viruses , studying the mechanism of protists and algae in living cells , and studying viruses that are infected with pathogens such as influenza and adenovirus . this work led to the translation of glikson 's hypothesis that viruses do not become extinct by chance but by active intervention of the cell and its environment .
he died of a heart attack on october 21 , 1952 , in sydney , nova scotia .

kurt lenz ( 18 september 1915 – 12 march 1991 ) was an austrian psychologist , professor at university of rostock . he was the youngest and second author of the eponymous book titled `` mental imagery `` in 1921 . lenz became a member of the faculty of physics at the university of rostock . he was an associate professor of brain sciences at university of vienna and of psychology at university of chicago from 1924 to 1948 . he was professor of sociology and behavior from 1949 to 1958 and professor at university of guelph from 1960 to 1980 . in 1983 , lenz was awarded an honorary doctorate from university of virginia .
in the 1920s and 1930s , lenz began an experiment involving an mri technique , scanning the brains of patients with encephalitis without giving them any instructions . to accomplish this , he took the brains of two patients , one with syphilis and one with no syphilis . the scans were taken in a hospital that made use of the newly invented mri machine at the time . lenz studied how the patients'brains responded to stimuli . he suggested that people with schizophrenia and those with anorexia nervosa had brain abnormalities that made them unable to observe a stimulus . in this study , lenz and associates found that the frontal lobe , the region of the brain that controls impulses , was severely damaged .
in addition to all this , he did something that no other person ever had done : he gave mental images , the mental images that a person had read , conversations in a text , and phrases used in the conversation to himself . this allowed him to experience sensory experiences that no one else could . the patient that he was studying , emil segal , would subsequently become the founder of the theory of `` visual encoding `` or how people see objects that were present when they view a visual scene .
lenz was professor of anthropology and psychological analysis at the university of vienna from 1948 to 1959 . he was also the first professor of psychology at the university of chicago . in 1958 , he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine .

= maximilian flom =
maximilian flom ( 29 december 1670 – 20 january 1717 ) was a danish philosopher , theologian , diplomat , jurist , and humanist who is best known as a professor of theology and logic at uppsala university .


== biography ==
flom was born in ilthedon , the son of jacob flom , a merchant in stibitz in the kingdom of denmark . after studying philosophy and theology at the university of copenhagen , he obtained the degree of doctor of theology in 1690 . following this , he went to düsseldorf , where he practiced law and theology . he died in 1717 , aged 76 .


== ideas ==
the anti-slavery philosophy he advocated is said to have greatly influenced the anti-slavery thought of his pupils . he is largely credited with introducing the concept of the indissolubility of marriage and with spreading the idea of social contract .
in 1698 , flom ( like michael pratz in 1704 ) wrote the famous prolegomena to his reform of the christian testimony , in which he defined the sin of leviticus and prohibited the killing of newborn children . his views seem to have had an impact on the development of legalistic rationalism in the 17th century , and inspired the danubian lutherans to apply the concept of pre-eminence to civil rights .
flom was known to have opposed the influence of great britain by changing his name to in 1702 to avoid complications with taxes . in 1713 , his reform of the christian testimony was published as prolegomena to the government and religion of denmark . in it he developed a new conception of justification , which , his response to the legalistic logic of calvin and others , affirmed the indispensability of divine revelation . flom argued that the writings of the bible , as a natural scriptural text , are theologically superior to the writings of later theologians , who had made special use of the bible to justify their views . the reform of the christian testimony , an article of his prolegomena , appeared in 1709.pettman , in his survey of maximilian flom , traces his theological ideas to the american calvinist writer , benjamin layton .

== life and work ==
son of a scientific researcher who worked in bioinformatics , moreno joined the faculty of sciences in 1939 as the same professor there , and taught for the next fifteen years . after the second world war , he spent some time in the united states with the national bureau of standards , which had been set up by the u.s. atomic energy commission and was working on mapping america 's nuclear program . as part of this project , he assisted charles giraud on the design of the first set of nine radar detectors . in 1947 , he was promoted to professor , and , after that , to full professor in 1959 . during this time he founded the institute of graphical studies , and became a consultant for the federal reserve bank of new york .
he retired from teaching in 1982 , and became the special director of the italian research council . he died in 1994 at age 70 , at the age of 74 .


== academic and research interests ==
moreno was most famous for an application of bernoulli stochasticity to properties of geometric surfaces , specifically the partial differential equation of state . he proved an `` auxiliary solution `` of this problem in 1994 by reducing the stochasticity calculus of these surfaces to an algebraic calculus of partial differential equations . this resulted in a completely different equation , assuming a positive mass parameter ( which it does not , according to hermann stumpf ) , by which to set the value of the molar potential . this result is sometimes known as the moreno-stumpf equation . moreno was also responsible for a chapter on univariate geometry , which is now known as the moreno–lefebvre theorem .

reif was born in karlsbad , where he studied chemistry , mineralogy , physics , and mathematics . his major work was on the problems of carbon , lignin , and nitrogen , but he also studied a diverse number of other subjects.reif became a professor in the department of mineralogy and geochemistry of the university of leipzig , which had been organized by friedrich wöhler and later named the `` seminarium für sozialproblem und handwerke der einrichtungsschriften `` ( `` seminar of fourteen masters in chemical and geochemical problems `` ) . it merged with the newly organized `` erlangen research institute `` in 1889 , where he organized and directed various scientific workshops . he was one of the many mineralogists who attended the astronomical observatory at the time .


== research on oxygen ==
reif was interested in the helium theory of hydrogen , and so were the two first members of the berlin chemical society , hans jespersen ( 1853-1916 ) and carl ammermann ( 1850-1921 ) . since then other members have contributed to the theory . martin friedrich kielinger ( 1871-1952 ) invented a practical computer for the study of technical data . the system was originally named in his honor , but german chemist august nobel ( 1865-1944 ) suggested the name `` reif 's box `` .as regards the reduction of gases , reif proved the gas theory of the first or second order and prepared a new method for determining the nuclear energy potential , in accordance with which it is possible to construct both nuclear and nonnuclear material . this method was later in turn superseded by the lorentz contraction , and was published in 1929 as the theoretical basis for modern thermodynamics .

== career ==
the institute of chemical physics operated in canada at that time , as the british scientific research council ( bsrc ) directed it . shaw joined the faculty of imperial college london to work on the problem of superconductivity and developed a theory of magnetoelectric effects ( by renormalization ) . in addition , shaw was a member of the british committee on radiation research . shaw was a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh from 1968 . in 1974 , he became a member of the royal society of canada and a fellow of the national academy of sciences . he retired from imperial college and became director of the mathematical sciences institute at imperial college . in 1975 , he became the director of the canadian institute for advanced studies .
shaw became a professor of theoretical physics at imperial college in 1975 . as a physicist , shaw did not create the numerical methods in physics group . however , his mathematical science , applied mathematics and statistical physics laboratories were very useful to the project .


== work ==
shaw presented his riemann–nodel numerical approach to the british scientific research council in 1946 . he introduced sub-routines into the theory of individual circuits of semiconductors in 1965 . this group 's real-valued theory is `` derived from experimental evidence. ``
shaw invented the numerical methods in physics group . in 1950 , shaw established a theoretical magnetic field for thin films of graphite by using riemann–nodel computer calculations . in this formulation , a current is excited in the thin film , and thus generated a magnetic field in the thin film , which is then projected in a new direction to the surface of the graphite . shaw wanted to see whether this artificial magnetic field could extend through the films . shaw decided to see whether this induced a change in the electrons in the films and thus could be influenced by light .
shaw 's work with dark matter was valuable to the theory of gravity . he showed in 1967 that if the direction of a star-forming nebula was shifted into the opposite direction of the direction of light , the gravitational field could not explain why the gravitational force could not be exerted on a star . the effect was modeled as pressure-dependent , by the principle of zwei und wunder . this work was published in 1975 , and was followed by shaw 's 2,118-page mathematical textbook theorie der gravitation .
shaw introduced the numerical methods in physics group in 1970 .

= johann heinrich albrecht =
johann heinrich albrecht ( 26 january 1764 in darmstadt – 21 may 1837 ) was a german lutheran preacher , poet and philosopher .


== life ==
albrecht was the son of a pastor , johann albrecht , in the lutheran church of kiel . he was also a soldier in the imperial german army during the first european war , in which he served in hanover , and finally after the war , in the german state of prussia . he taught at the city academy in darmstadt , on the university of darmstadt 's faculty of classical philology . in 1807 , he became professor of logic and history in the new university of darmstadt , succeeding karl liebmann , and in 1810 , he became professor of hebrew and persian . in 1817 he was promoted to professor of philology , and soon after to editor of an academic journal and pamphleteer . in 1826 he became a christian-protestant preacher .
he was friends with the pious andr ephraim lessing ( 1804–1872 ) and johann sebastian bach ( d. 1868 ) . in this series of works , he wrote on theological questions , from the theory of essences to philosophical foundations . albrecht 's theology , both theological and philosophical , has been called a periodical of absolute love of god .
albrecht is credited with popularizing eudemianus 's dictum that god is the identical with the author . he was the first to identify the idea of `` sanctification through the cross `` as important in religious thought ; in his treatise the life and writings of eudemianus lessing , albrecht explains that the concept of the `` cross `` is the reception by god of what is held to be evil in the sinner , and the moment the lord , in order to save himself , obtains the divine power to bring sinners back to the original state , he fulfils this power by bearing out what lessing calls the `` creative `` elements of the sinner 's being . another important philosopher and writer of the 19th century , martin heidegger ( 1859–1938 ) , claimed that for albrecht the idea of `` sanctification through the cross `` `` is the most great answer to the problem of the existence of jesus christ `` . an important principle of the schleiermacher doctrine , which is based on the idea that `` creation , life and death are one `` , is an extension of lessing 's notion of the cross .
an eclectic view of biblical revelation as ultimately caused by god , albrecht disagreed with leibniz and weyland , or their christian school of theology . he thought that the westminster canon of scripture was far too convoluted , due to the overlap of theological views and dogmatic doctrines . he saw the new testament as a collection of conflicting , sometimes contradictory ideas from different prophets and traditions . in his 1827 work haßgabe der naturgeschichte , albrecht claimed that androgyny , an institution which existed among christian women before the first half of the 20th century , did not exist among the jews . he wrote that even the jewish g-d did not have male genitalia , nor did heimmen possess virility . albrecht also disagreed with leibniz 's religious system . leibniz held that all people should believe in god and to strive towards holiness . however , albrecht , who was not a lutheran , took an agnostic position , holding that all god 's creation was created without mercy . he believed that god was to be understood as an undifferentiated being , who did not desire the suffering and suffering of others and saw human suffering as one of god 's ways of worshiping him .

== biography ==
vassily fedotov was born in chigain , s.y . his mother was nadezhda leningradna alizradeva and his father was an officer . his parents separated in 1898 and he moved to ufa , siberia , to live with his father . there he studied mathematics under nadezhda `` s brother eduard .
he graduated from the university in 1906 and joined the chigain agricultural institute , where he graduated in 1913 . in 1915 he graduated from the moscow state university .
he was appointed chair of combinatorics and semitic linear geometry and taught there until his death .
in 1917 he founded the federal institute of topology , where he built an elegant topological space for a first model of a 6-dimensional euclidean space , in 1921 he proposed the theory of homogeneous groups . in 1924 he became a member of the united soviet of russia .
he married into the alizradev family , whose members held political leadership positions throughout his long life . in 1924 , the family moved to the ufa desert city of yevpatoria , where fedotov taught mathematics there . he also became a mayor of the city . he moved back to moscow in 1924 , to work with his older brother eduard . his brother , boris fedotov , a renowned geodesist , died of a heart attack in 1924.fedotov died in the moscow soviet experimental state hospital on 23 november 1969 , at the age of 71 .


== achievements ==
fedotov introduced the concept of the intersection-member group , groupoids , and non-adjoint-groupoids to algebraic topology , supergroups and and topology . he developed the concept of an integrable natural group of l1 with a function ∅⁡ , and the idea of index classes on groupoids . he proved that as a vector space , a groupoid contains a prime and studied the affine case for it .
he was the first to apply axioms of regular geometry to the extended euclidean space , which made the conjectures that closed spaces had finite density or closed classes , and that groups had curvatures . he also took interest in the idea of parallel exterior corners , which is how geometry is often structured in planes , in regions which have an algebraic surface . in 1933 he showed that non-adjoint regions of a field bundle are orthogonal to the normals , thus excluding or at least decreasing the unpaired group-like graph . he proved that there exist a unique group of closed sets , g ( n ) , such that it is possible to enumerate subsets of it by subjoining the subgroups of g with edges :

urey died in los alamos , new mexico , on august 21 , 1998 , aged 93 . in 2005 , he was inducted into the national nuclear security administration hall of fame , with the following citation :

`` urey 's ability to forge a solid point atom remained with us for decades . his initial results suggested that the initial bombardment of uranium atoms might be an important starting point for the next generation of atomic bombs . urey 's lab study also produced the first evidence of the plutonium–uranium bond , the fundamental bond-formation step in fission . he and his colleagues'achievement resulted in the manufacture of more than 1 billion u-235 isotopes through the process known as fission . more important , he was able to understand that the elimination of these isotopes would have the potential to enable the commercial production of even more enriched uranium. ``

franz was born in berlin and was the son of johann friedrich franz . he studied theology and philosophy at the universities of wittenberg and mainz , and then in 1875 became pastor of the prösident-preacher 's church in the town of felzen . for the following years he taught theology at the university of berlin and at the stiftendisch-lutheran heidelberg . in 1881 he was elected a member of the friedrichsministerium as well as the fortschritte des wörters-gesellschafts in berlin . in 1898 he took up the post of consul-general of norway .
he was a member of the lutheran central council from 1891 to 1905 and also president of the reichstag in 1904 and 1905.in 1908 he was appointed minister of the remonstrants-upper widows-deaconess in moscow .
he was a supporter of the berlin peace conference , of which he was the grand-consul , and a candidate of the german confederation , which elected him as one of its members in 1907 . from 1921 he worked for a return to legislative practice .


== views ==
from 1895 he was a friend and patron of leo strauss and wilhelm reich.on the great outbreak of world war i in 1914 , franz insisted that any german soldier who was caught with a hand gun not be sent to the front and declared :

german soldiers must be on their guard against the invasion of the civilized world by the counter-intelligentsia .
from 1918 , he worked with karl barth to organize , in geneva , the league of nations minor nations conference which was held in geneva in march 1918 . the following week franz , barth and others from the lutheran council in bavaria , leopold liebenfels and louis alkan , all of whom were occupying the provincial chair , attended the war conference which was held in paris and delivered a series of addresses in german about the issue . franz gave the first part of this series , vienna in november 1918 .
according to joachim gmelin , franz was the leading theoretician of lutheran fundamentalism . despite both mainlining the doctrine of a single trinity and drawing on several authoritatively as well asologically based doctrines , he was strongly opposed to papal infallibility . he did not support episcopacy and rejected the emerging doctrine of the `` eschatological church `` . he emphasized the necessity for the lutheran churches to defend and improve themselves against russian persecution . he considered it essential that lutheranism should leave behind the tradition of light-years of orthodoxy and firmly follow the german reformation and the other lutheran christian doctrines of the 4th century . despite his personal condemnation of bolshevism , he remained sympathetic to the russian cause until the end of world war i .


== works ==
according to edward s. marks , `` we owe much to the works of karl franz : `` a comprehensive biblia lutherana paralinguisticae ( 3 vols . berlin and leipzig , 1877–1886 ) ; a supplement to leo strauss'einleitung des vollkommenen des danz . ; an extensive bibliography of translations of the old and new testaments ; a history of the prussian league of representatives , compiled from documents , which in german ( in his honour ) was developed by c. werner goebel ; and a classic general essay on christian theology , `` de iugua die christliche mystik `` , in which he answers questions of an important international character by arguing that the christian religion can proceed logically from a solid foundation on a sufficient number of principles of clear logic .

== life ==
herbert brinck was born in wettewegen near konstanz , near lake constance in north rhine-westphalia ( today part of north rhine-westphalia , germany ) . he was educated at the sorbonne and received an m.a . degree in mathematics from the university of jena in 1885 . he obtained an honorary doctorate from the university of göttingen in 1886 . in 1893 he moved to boston where he pursued his professional career and in 1898 was elected to the american mathematical society . he was elected a member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1911 . he served as president of the american mathematical society in 1914–15 . he was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1922 and to the national academy of sciences in 1932 . he was one of the authors of many landmark articles and book reviews , being best known for `` the analytic and inductive lectures , `` which appeared in the transactions of the cambridge philosophical society .
brinck is best known for his major contributions to the development of the theory of rings . in 1897 , he published the landmark article , `` recent work on the ability of pieces of a partial algebra to be solvable with respect to each other. `` the article proposes a link between torsion and , through its integration , the normal portion of a complete group.his contribution to the calculus of complex numbers , beginning in 1910 and continuing until his death in 1947 , is arguably his most important and lasting contribution to the subject . he formulated the brinck identity , a group that describes equations in algebra , proving that for all , b , c and d are in the group by the given constants , the second possibility `` since b is the root of the partial product of c and d , it is the same as both the solution of the equations of the group and of the original problem `` .brinck and paul ehrenfest are sometimes considered co-authors because the pair , who co-authored four different pieces of the theory of complex numbers , often pursued the same lines of research and independently pursued identical sets of problems , with ehrenfest on the left and brinck on the right .

schofield worked as an assistant to gerhard kalbf , but at the end of the 1845 academic year she was appointed at the university of zürich 's head of the geological service , thus becoming one of the first female geologists in switzerland .
her descriptions of early reptile fossils at the gütersloh entomological museum at zürich and her work on flint tools , such as the grinding tool , were important in the development of trilobite-toad teeth in prehistoric geologists like karl gärtner . schofield introduced the terms `` cracodomie `` and `` stannochronon `` . while working at the zoological museum in stuttgart in 1864 , she served as curator of mineralogy .


== early life ==
heim was born into a well-to-do family of schofields , zilberts and jewellery specialists , in a wealthy zürich suburb . she was the third of six children of a wealthy german merchant . her grandfather had left an estate for his children . schofield 's father encouraged her interest in the natural sciences . her maternal grandfather heinrich heinrich heinrich ( 1790–1859 ) was a superintendent of mines in zürich , and was regarded as an important and cultured businessman , a skilled collector of natural history and an engraver .
after she graduated from zürich university , heim went to switzerland for research on plants , mineralogy and philology .


== career ==
in 1845 heim met carl friedrich stebbins and introduced him to zoology . stebbins , was also a renowned swiss dentist and museum director , and had a keen interest in birds and other reptiles . their family background ( having inherited several estates and agricultural estates from their parents ) raised a large amount of the family wealth in that part of switzerland . heim would study as many different natural sciences as possible , and is credited with founding the field of palaeontology in 1849 .
heim in 1853 became the first woman geologist at the university of zürich . she did some geological research on lake eshelia in switzerland , and named several vertebrates after lake eshelia . she also introduced geology as a separate discipline of palaeontology to her university .
in 1860 she was appointed lecturer in palaeontology at the university of zürich . she was one of the first women geologists in the world .
the volcano mazoök in finland ( now baden-baden ) is named after her , as are the four continents and the figure in which schofield 's husband georg schmidt and von rosencrantz fischer settled in 1841 at the mouth of lake eshelia . the depression on the arctic circle ( in reference to large scale changes of temperature over long time-periods ) is also named after her .

frederick willibald abel ( 30 december 1814 , sandweiss – 23 september 1898 , penzance ) was a scottish physician and naturalist . abel is best known as one of the founders of the field of botany in scotland , although his achievements in that area would go on to make him internationally known . abel was the author of descriptions of the highland grass , the english alfalfa , and the tobacco plant , and he is also considered to be one of the pioneers of scottish botany . he is commemorated in the scientific names of the scottish alfalfa plant and the northern whiteflower , and in that of the english tobacco plant .


== biography ==
abel was the son of a farmer , in the village of sandweiss . he went to the university at sandweiss in 1836 , graduating ba in medicine in 1840 , and ma in medicine in 1840 . while still in the university , he studied medicine and veterinary medicine under john campbell morton , becoming demonstrator in 1846 . he received his md in 1847.while still in university , abel married margaret maclaine in 1846 , and they had two children : william abel of solihull and elizabeth ann maclaine of ayr . abel died in penzance in 1898 .

gerhard neumann ( 1 september 1848 – 1 april 1929 ) was a german writer and psychologist . in addition to the works discussed in this post , the following works by neumann have been translated and reissued on a variety of occasions ( most often from german ) :


== literary works ==
one of his most important works is weltwort und briefbegriff der psychologie , a comprehensive book on psychologia , research psychology , and psychology in general . neumann coined the term psychologia when he tried to define its key components : human psychology and the various traits that distinguish humans , and all psychologia are tools for this purpose , but also , rather , have social and educational attributes .
his most famous book is his sixth and most influential essay `` what is science ? '' . in this essay neumann argues that science is the study of information , the diffusion of ideas , and the integration of information into behavior . some of his notable quotes :

in determining the material structure of the brain , freud was guided by the `` structuralist `` model of the brain .
it was all the more extraordinary for freud 's interest in thought and its relation to social behavior and its division into `` its sacred `` and `` its profane `` parts .
ideas are therefore not regarded , as `` social categories `` , as the product of the intentional and the accidental , but as structures integral to human experience which reach within the atom and form part of it .
a wish for absolute certainty and a willingness to throw out all assumptions concerning meaning became a fundamental part of the development of the `` critical theory `` and of `` scientific psychology `` .
the objective reality of experience and the free , spontaneous movement of consciousness are also interrelated .
social personality—the state of being one-sidedly individualistic , indifferent , and egotistical —was one manifestation of a `` larger structure of social development and aspects of psychological individuation `` [ e.g. , `` philosophische staatswissenschaft `` ] , whose application also requires psychological psychiatry .


== awards and honors ==
in 1906 he received the walter schirmer medal .
in 1923 he was made a member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences .
in 1933 neumann was awarded the elisabeth weitling-stein prize by the royal academy of medicine in the netherlands .

boling was a founding director of superareal , an energy company , in 1952 and a shareholder of the company from its inception in 1956 . he was executive director from 1954 to 1960 , and a member of the board of directors of all of the company 's major clients , until his death . in 1960 , superareal was awarded the green world prize by the then-chancellor of the university of oxford .
in 1957 he co-founded superareal , one of the first companies to manage the potential of energy storage , with his research partner john r. collison . superareal built the first large commercial-scale energy storage unit , the licktown power station , that was completed in 1959 .
superareal also developed another energy storage project , the aurora project . the aurora project has been criticised for the very high cost of building and operating its home-brew power unit , but boling claimed that they had achieved 50 per cent savings , at no extra cost to the company .
in 1968 , boling co-founded the cycle , a renewable energy company in which he took over the management of battersea power station . the company 's headquarters in chelsea have since been acquired by the uk government as part of the public sector clean energy plan . boling served as co-founder and chairman of the cycle from 1969 until his death . in 1971 , the cycle was acquired by the czech firm cgm systems . in 1981 boling left the cycle and embarked on a number of other business ventures , including :

construction of the melbourne industrial park
linking the river severn with the swansea harbour station
energy storage at the rovistrail cymru project , which has been criticised as being too expensive
energy storage at the severn power station , in somerset , using japanese tungsten ( edge ) technology , and batteries that were hybridised with natural gas
inventor of the cyclotron ; first demonstrated to generate electricity through thermal gradients and was used in an experiment with an air gap of 12 metres to demonstrate the effectiveness of electricity compression

= james rennie =
sir james rennie ( 1794–1880 ) , was a british scientist .
he was born at bolsted , cambridgeshire , on 24 january 1794 . he was educated at aberdeenshire grammar school , and at the university of cambridge .
he was then appointed private teacher at sibyl whitehouse 's school , middlesex , and at the metropolitan high school , oxford . he also taught at calcutta girls'high school for boys in 1821 , and the newly founded kilburn school for girls . in 1822 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh .


== works ==
rennie was a discoverer of the wavelike `` filament-tube phenomenon `` . he explored the elastic properties of rubber , finding that the filament-tube inside was a much lighter and more flexible material . it contained `` elastic fibres `` that could become thin enough to be suspended in the air , compress in the air , and give way at sudden strikes . he went on to demonstrate that it was the elastic properties of the fibres themselves that made the tube behave the way it did.the magnetic properties of the filament-tube were improved by experiments on the propagation of electrical current by the object that was being touched .


== influence on physics ==
other influences of his were on the development of meteorology . in 1829 he published a paper that suggested that rain might occur whenever the sky was cloudless . he also published studies on the lightning that resulted when a storm struck certain geographical regions . rennie came into contact with the geographer john aubrey fowle and the landscape writer and scholar charles-leonard dix.he also contributed to the study of anemotropies . rennie proposed that unlike erect or twilight stars , the locations of the stars would be very different during the day from at night . this hypothesis was now called the rennie hypothesis .

== life ==
an advocate of the will to power , he became a prominent figure in several liberal and religious organizations . in this context , he is known for his leadership in conferences and groups called the internationale de la liberté , for which he was appointed honorary general , and for having founded the journal internationale en islame and the monthly european left review .


== education ==
aufderheide studied at the universities of karlsruhe and heidelberg , obtaining his phd there in 1948 . from 1949 to 1953 he worked as a writer and professor of european history at the university of heidelberg . from 1952 he taught history at the university of strasbourg .


== awards and honors ==
aufderheide was awarded the albert wilhelm rubens prize for the year 1958 , the wiesbaden prize for the year 1960 , the order of the third order , the legion of honor , the order of elios , and the catholic-lutheran war council medal , all of which were the first recipients of awards associated with his accomplishments . he was awarded the dauphiné , the gold medallion of the order of albert , and the rose gold medal of the internationale de la liberté . he was awarded the order of the star of saint-sulpice , the order of the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople , and the legion of honour . from 1953 he was a member of the board of directors of the national socialist german democratic republic . in 1981 he was named a knight of the order of merit of the german federal republic .


== views ==
aufderheide believed that most ideologies of the old world , such as marxism , were deficient in historical specificity . aufderheide also felt that there was no alternative to the will to power . he believed that governments should try to achieve a `` and . - ( see dialectical process ) model of economic development `` which he termed `` fascism with a more diverse economic system. `` one problem with historical-critical ideology is that it ignores genuine movements that have been the driving force of movement . as mentioned earlier , many institutions and ideologies have roots in the older world . however , based on their financial and material makeup and their material resources , they largely lack dynamism . aufderheide viewed what was taking place in the world as the direction of progress ; the future was therefore in progress , and the question of what to do with those resources became a necessity for politics .


== personal life ==
aufderheide died of leukemia in strasbourg , france on november 12 , 1991 , from which , it is reported , he had been suffering from cancer for the last eleven years of his life .

paštko-obanov ( russian : аторо ивашонович оаностанко , ukrainian : аторо ивашонович оаностанко ; 12 november 1863 – 8 march 1943 ) was a russian russian physicist , mathematician , and engineer . his name is best known for an important work that he formulated in the early 1930s , but this work is often linked with the development of the wave theory of electrodynamics ( at the time it was considered its own discipline , and by the late 1930s it had become one of the most important physics disciplines ) . the work became a major early example of field theory in quantum mechanics .
his work on noncommuting non-lattice equations led him to develop methods of algebraic analysis . his many projects at the institute of theoretical physics in leningrad , and his book code-free algebra ( 1959 ) , are credited with popularizing these methods .
during world war ii , he headed the leningrad physics department and headed the leningrad nuclear institute ( a unit of the leningrad academy of sciences ) .

= christian grubb =
christoph august christian grubb ( 10 march 1535 in stettin – 6 march 1635 in münster ) was a theologian of the reform of the german reformation .


== life ==
he was born in the village of stettin , the son of thomas grubb ( d. 1582 ) and his wife caroline ( née gläffer ) , and entered the episcopate at the age of six , whereupon he entered the house of the astronomer constantius felix , to whom he frequently addressed himself . on the death of constantius felix , in 1582 , he became tutor of his son , and was called to the chair of doctrine , afterwards ; but , in 1587 , after having been elected vicar of berne , he was ejected by the reformers , and detained in stettin , so as to be deprived of his clerical powers , and deprived of his offices as rector of the said college .
he was employed in designing and constructing the former palace of the gymnasium , and in other ecclesiastical matters , and was afterwards one of the predecessors of elias münster , afterwards bishop of göttingen , and bishop of dresden , dresden in 1607 . in 1607 , he came to stettin , where his native birthplace , and house , and the famous church , were greatly loved , and are to-day still noted . the old german university , between which the humboldtian and ionic exchange stands , was reconverted to protestantism , and his choice of residence , he says , to that place , and of a great age , was a generous kindness of attention to piety . the teaching of the reformed school , in which he was the head , was eloquent , dignified , and , though ( he says ) somewhat oftener than is usual in a german theologian , in a good measure modish ; nor did he abuse the liberties of the professors , who ( at that time ) visited him and heard the more of his discourse . his study of eastern science ( which must have been more extensive than that of his ancestors ) , which , notwithstanding being principally germanic , he sometimes showed in an oriental manner , added an admirably to the comfort and improvement of his companions , and was of consequence to all his successors.he made considerable private collections of greek and latin antiquities , and brought letters to the german statesmen and other prominent men of letters , amongst them archibald cumont and jakob prüfer , and some pamphlets on the history of politics , especiallie in historia humano et cartographye . he had letters from the pope and princes to him , and also private letters from john calvin and thomas foster ( afterwards bishop of durham ) . grubb was a patron of luther 's work , and also for the learned jan koßler ( 1609–1664 ) .


== works ==
he is most esteemed for the revue sur l'évolution de la juge , libre et artificiel , opus locum ex pentate dilutione , which appeared in 1605 , and was afterwards edited by thomas bennett . it contains four volumes ; in which is the full list of characters , of every science , of every church , and of every district in germany .

his letters are on the ruins of a gothic church of the exchange at stettin , in germany .

== selected writings ==
hyndman was an expert on the physiology and pathology of the lymphatic system and is recognized as a pioneer in lymphatic disease classification . in the early stages of his career , he concentrated on its purification in the form of a filtrate . he also wrote a series of treatises on diseases of the heart ( 1902 ) , the first of which discussed supranuclear lymphatic filtration and was translated into german , french , italian and hebrew . in it he first described the role of lymphocytes in circulation and pioneered the emphasis on in vitro .
hyndman is recognized as the founder of the division of the lymphatic system into two types : the resident and the proximal . a resident type represents the majority of patients with acute lymphadenopathy , such as melanoma , and is the last of the lymphatic system subgroups . these subgroups are defined as the subtype area ( a ) , beta-thymic area ( b ) , and obvious area ( o ) .

== early life ==

tadeusz pawlowski was born on 27 december 1921 in halany – then a warsaw , then a polish republic enclave – into a modest family . his mother was andrzej pawlowski , a teacher ; his father , antoni wierński , was a construction worker . according to his wife , tadeusz'father `` did not understand polish `` and , on his deathbed , was shocked to find out that his son was an atheist . for some time , tadeusz was known in his family to be `` a kind and respectable son `` who was interested in music and children 's books . the family lived in an affluent neighborhood of polish cities ( kraków in particular ) in the warsaw uprising years . according to tadeusz , his mother was a high-ranking bureaucrat in wrocław . `` she showed the characteristics of a former soviet officer . it is not unusual for children of my family to fall under the influence of the communists .
`` in 1936 , the family moved to kraków , where tadeusz was enrolled in the warsaw gymnasium . for the next two years he also attended , with some difficulty , private high schools in kolozsvár ( part of warsaw uprising ) , przemyńskie ( błopolice ) , and mayów ( munk ) . there , at the age of 15 , tadeusz had a vision of the right path for himself that he later described as reaching the ultimate meaning of physical life . at the age of 17 he obtained his diploma at the gymnasium .

from 1937 to 1938 , pawlowski studied at the galician institute of mines at kraków and from 1938 to 1940 he studied at the warsaw university of technology ( institute of cybernetics ) , now known as the polish national institute of cybernetics . pawlowski 's thesis supervisor was władysław bonino . during his year at the institute , the student l. b. kaganowski , a polish mathematician , pointed out one of pawlowski 's problems , which posed a `` problem of reason `` . in response , in 1939 , tadeusz applied for a ph.d. at the university of warsaw under the supervision of dimitrie mikulěska .
in 1942 , tadeusz graduated with a degree in mathematics from the university of warsaw , this time with a thesis on the area of the combinatorics of non-ideal number theory . in 1948 , tadeusz returned to wrocław as an assistant in the department of mathematics of the warsaw university and worked at the science and technology institute as an experimentalist and in the department of symbolic logic . in 1947 he was appointed lecturer in mathematics at the newly founded warsaw mathematical institute ( polish : pionik institute ) .from 1950 until 1954 he was professor of mathematics at warsaw university . in 1954 he was elected to the polish academy of sciences . in 1964 , he was created the central committee of the polish federation for the advancement of jewish understanding , of which he was one of the first members .


== recognition ==
in 1960 , tadeusz pawlowski was elected to the polish academy of sciences ( państwowi ) . his name is the latin version of lajos pawlowski . he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1973 .
in 1990 , the institute of symbolic logic in warsaw was renamed the polish institute for mathematical logic ( polish : opjednocji minierowe w zwówiekom ) ( polish : opjedno minierowe w zwówiekom ) .

= paul wiegand =
paul wiegand ( march 19 , 1888 – june 30 , 1962 ) was an american mathematician known for his research on linear algebra , and was a co-discoverer of brownian motion .


== biography ==
wiegand received his education at oakland high school , where he received an a.b . degree in 1902 . he enrolled at the university of michigan in 1906 , intending to study physics , but dropped out before his second class and instead became a research student in classical theory at the chicago school of mathematics . in 1913 he took an m.a . degree in mathematics , for which he received the ph.d. degree in 1918 . for the rest of his academic career he was a professor of mathematics at the university of michigan .


== discoverer of brownian motion ==
his 1929 paper on `` the conservation of orthonormal moment in a scalar sphere with quasi-continuous period `` sparked interest in brownian motion , and paved the way for the discovery of brownian motion by heinz polanyi . the paper was a crucial piece in what would become the modern conception of brownian motion . in 1930 , wiegand helped to write a german translation of polanyi 's book on brownian motion , showing the later extent to which brownian motion was a correct mathematical description of the smooth , non-steady motion of a cylindrical system .
in 1933 , polanyi and wiegand first published a document establishing the linear system of brownian motion as a function of time in pyle 's proof of the brownian hamiltonian . the two subsequently became interested in the topic of brownian motion in a broader sense , and together wrote a major article in 1936 that introduced brownian motion as a term for the elasticity of a curve .
in his 1929 paper , wiegand provided proof of the conservation of orthonormal moment in a scalar sphere with quasi-continuous period , based on brownian motion data . this was the first linear system of brownian motion to be shown to be invariant to time .
in the 1936 paper wiegand introduced the term brownian motion . the discussion is of brownian motion given by brownian curves that are replaced by brownian surfaces that are not filled in by stochastic processes ; the existence of brownian surfaces during general relativity ( to use the more general expression of the same name , in the terms of this paper ) was later confirmed by john von neumann . the concept of brownian motion gained popularity in the 20th century , however .


== goldschmidt co-discoverer ==
in 1936 , after carrying out research at chicago university on brownian motion with ernest heaviside , wiegand came across one of heaviside 's papers that had been co-written with him , in particular the critical proof of brownian motion written in 1934 by ramon tamayo . as of this writing , an english-language proof for brownian motion , by jerry p. goldschmidt and robert s. wilson , and an english translation of the original paper , by peter volynkin , have been published . the two papers together with the critical proof of brownian motion , together with other papers , constitute the fundamental work in the mathematical investigation of brownian motion , which has in turn led to the generalization of the generalization of brownian motion into properties of curved , non-steady , non-linear systems.the majority of brownian motion is known from experiments of moving rotating cylinders.wiegand was also an excellent mathematician , particularly a book-taker . he received a b.a . from oakland in 1910 , and an m.a . from chicago in 1911 , and became a full professor in 1919 . he also collaborated with john von neumann , and with joseph stein , to write a book on brownian motion titled relativistic methods for brownian mechanics and its applications , first published in 1937 .

wiegand died at his home in bethesda , maryland , of a heart attack on june 30 , 1962 .

in 1823 he wrote hymn , composed for the choir of st. john 's , london , during the service on the christmas eve . the verses have been noted in bl . he now shows signs of deterioration in health ; he died on 25 june 1872 . he was married six times . the son of his oldest son was dr. alexander perthes p.c .

== biography ==
pierre-joseph decleau was born in paris in 1889 . in 1911 he went to the university of strasbourg to do his medical studies . after a year there he returned to the école normale supérieure , where he remained in 1921 .
decleau is best known for his role in developing the concept of the caprice octopelagic , first proposed by r. guébeau and later further developed by him . it is a model for interpreting the herniation skeleton . decleau used a microscope to study the structure of skeletal muscles in chickens , which is a famous model in connection with herniation research . the idea gained international recognition , and was that of creation of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) , the premier research center of herniation research .
decleau was a founding member of the french academy of sciences , chairman of the anthroposophic society , and one of the founders of the société musculaire , both in 1894 and 1895.his contributions in herniation are noted in numerous studies , e.g. , the volume blasphemy exposé d'absences par la paralyze et du sacroiliac les hénatiques in 1906 .

alexander bonfield ( january 13 , 1842 – october 25 , 1942 ) was an american naturalist and anthropologist .


== early life ==
bonfield was born in new hampshire on january 13 , 1842 . he attended the eastern new england academy . he spent two years at yale university where he graduated in 1857 .


== career ==
bonfield was an expert on the american fauna , although he never published on the subject . he became professor of anthropology and zoology at boston university and later harvard university , where he produced one of the best written accounts of american and european animal life in english . his three-volume , monumental work , the history of the mammalia of the united states , was a landmark in the history of natural history.his aim was to take the wealth of scientific knowledge of the united states into a scholarly context , filling in the gaps in this knowledge in order to make a comprehensible , detailed , and informative picture of our animal neighbors . at the same time , he maintained a strong personal , social and philosophical relationship with his students , a relationship exemplified by his own and their devotion to one another . this style of development marked him as an extraordinary educational teacher who influenced the generations of american naturalists who came after him . as a scholar he was often criticized for being less concerned with history than with illustration . he was never particularly interested in other fields , and he was largely self-taught in all but one field : zoology . his best works described in a systematic manner the features of a wide range of american animals . among his most important discoveries was the field of ornithology .
he began working on what became the mammalia of the united states after the completion of his `` the history of the mammalia `` in 1856 . the vast majority of his work focused on , and was based upon , his knowledge of the american fauna and fisheries . his subsequent publications included the field notes to the collections of north american mammals ( 1860 ) , the mammal genus : america ( 1868 ) and the descriptive volumes on `` living fossils `` ( 1875 ) and `` the distribution and affinities of the birds `` ( 1884 ) .
as an educator , bonfield made a point of stressing the roles of both parents and children in their upbringing . he was the first person to teach his own children how to interpret and interpret in the way they wanted to see a particular object . one of the first children he taught the social psychology of learning to is sam and his mother pat taub . sam is the primary example of a boy who grew up in isolation and left home early because he feared abandonment from his father , a position he himself had.in contrast to the boy sam , the many girls in his life left home early to pursue their interests . in his review of ann , another of his great works , he wrote :

who is the author of ann ? and how does this child come to know him as a father who educated him , and who nurtured him , and who taught him to look upon his accomplishments as significant and noble , and valued as he himself regarded them ? it is about him that women finally gather to discuss the more recent field of `` sexual difference `` . he is the first to have awakened the warning voice of the father who sent the child away .

he studied at columbia university and the university of kansas before joining the united states navy in 1890 . after serving as a sailor for seven years , he left the navy to enter medical school at brown university . his major training was in botany and , for a while , taught botany in the indiana university college of agriculture .


== career ==
the fbi office of technical investigations ( o.t.i . ) in washington , d.c. , began a new unit devoted to plant pathology in 1917 . one of the first senior plants pathologists to work at the o.t.i. , reynolds was brought in as a technical specialist to assist them in determining the concentration of tobacco in plants . the plant pathologist was to help put together a method that indicated the probable concentration of nicotine in tobacco leaves by using a chemical analysis of specimens from plants grown at the d.c. saguaro plant science center . reynolds initiated the process and initiated new methods for quantifying the concentration of tobacco in various plant tissues and reagents . he developed the doctrine of mechanistic and mechanistic identification .

== biography ==
he was born at trois règles , pays , to jeanne-marie hiscardne colvin , a teacher , and pierre henry jean ( né colvin ) , a botanist . colvin had no formal education , instead studying in nantes , obtaining his ba from the paris conservatoire in 1922 with a thesis entitled pallasiodes tratacensis .
his studies coincided with a time when paleontologists were discovering a whole new diversity of large animals , among them mammoth , dinosaurs and birds . historians remember him as one of the pioneers of paleontological research in france . colvin demonstrated the contribution of such research by working with such prominent figures as francis crick , charles darwin , lamarck , alexander von humboldt , and others .
following the conclusion of world war ii , colvin returned to france , and then to the united states to take up his post at the university of california , los angeles , where he became a professor of earth sciences in the late 1940s . colvin developed the core idea of a `` paleozoic continuity `` in the fossil record , which gave the majority of earth 's extant animals a common ancestry , appearing among the second ( carboniferous ) and third ( triassic ) groups . he also , in 1968 , made possible the direct evolution of dinosaurs to provide evidence for a triassic age for earth . he is widely known for the newly discovered fossil , which is named for him.one of colvin 's last scientific activities was as a professor at louisiana state university where he discovered the fossilised remains of anolis galliensis , named in his honor in 1975 .

philip slughorn ( 15 may 1907 – 29 march 1980 ) was an english protestant theologian , professor of theology at vassar , and advocate of a reformed roman catholicism in the united states . he authored the catholic tradition and the modern world , and both god in history and a critical history of the church .


== biography ==
slughorn was born on 15 may 1907 in gloucester , england , the son of philip slughorn ( 1879–1938 ) and marianelle ( née jeffries ) slughorn . in 1938 , he married elisabeth julia richards , daughter of e. scott richards , dean of king 's college , london , who died in 1950 . she died two years later on 29 march of that year , and was succeeded by his second wife , clare acworth richards , of mount allison , maine . he married his third wife in 1948 , while still at king 's .


== views ==
slughorn advocated an `` anglican tradition in the british catholic tradition `` , of which the second half was preceded by a revised version , the second parish . he saw no need for the traditional church to continue to adhere to biblical revelation . his first published work was a critical history of the church , in 1959 . he contributed to many books and journals , and was a regular contributor to the american catholic . while at king 's , he was editor of the american studies review .


== approaches to catholicism ==
slughorn believed that he `` understood the reasons for american catholicism , and the catholic theological reason , to be in the interdependent system of history of the church `` . modernist protestantism was a `` central aspect of catholicism `` . religion was always a matter of `` individual choice `` , but there were good and bad reasons for joining and not joining various major denominations . an essential difference between traditional catholicism and modern protestantism was the justification of catholic doctrine through reason .
he rejected the theological method which was used by many contemporary protestants , but believed that in catholicism the `` process of systematic investigation and systematic critique of dogma is ... essential , and the process which yields a satisfactory judgment of dogma must always remain an act of conscious faith. `` slughorn believed that `` faith alone , as such , can sanction itself as a reliable basis for dogmatic controversy `` , and found in his early catholic writings a `` higher level of mystery `` than orthodox protestantism.slughorn rejected the teaching of the jesuits and the teachings of the council of trent . he instead supported the historic authority of the holy see . he was an opponent of ecumenism , arguing that all anglicans need to engage in dialogue with one another . slughorn advocated that the current supreme pontiff of the roman catholic church , pope john xxiii , be replaced `` on the present day or the appointed day , by a pope as said to be more just `` .
slughorn identified with the traditional form of the roman catholic church , with its insistence on the natural order of creation and that jesus christ was god . he called that form `` anglicanism `` , but later said it `` hides the biblical truth. ``

august albert kosciuszko ( 31 july 1903 , münster – 5 january 1997 , madrid ) was a german physicist .
born in münster , he studied in kiel and became a professor at the albert university of munich in 1938 . he then served in the armed forces for two years . his formal doctorate in physics was awarded in 1951 under the supervision of the physicists hermann heisenberg and richard feynman .


== scientific activities ==
while working in kiel , august and his colleague , otto hahn , predicted the gamma ray and neutron bombardments . august kosciuszko carried out this research in 1957 . the satellites of the european space research organisation sputnik were observed by observing the fainter evidence of an extensive nuclear fusion process , subsequently discovered to be active . this event , which was attributed to heavy water explosions in the sun 's outer atmosphere , was later observed to be due to what was termed a `` thermonuclear fission `` or `` thermonuclear fission of plutonium-238 to uranium-235. `` he revealed that radioactive fission of plutonium-238 is occurring with an atomic weight of 240 gev . this event occurred about 40 years before the discovery of atomic bombs and was referred to as a `` bang `` or `` nuclear explosion `` and had an amazing impact on both science and politics .
he became interested in particle physics after the discovery of the bose–einstein condensates by wilhelm wigner . while conducting his research in munich , he demonstrated in 1952 that , by exchanging a positively charged atomic nucleus for a negatively charged atomic nucleus , a number of forces exist between them . these forces are termed `` the monotony principle `` and are the same ones which explain why objects ( including protons and neutrons ) behave the same on an atomic scale . the first experiment conducted using the theory of conduction of protons , which resulted in the observation of neutrons decaying rapidly into neutrons , was referred to as the first `` bang `` . he published his findings in a 1959 paper in the journal nature and shared this important discovery with ferdinand von neumann.kosciuszko is considered one of the greatest physicist of the 20th century.he is a member of the german academy of science , and the albertina wilhelm leopoldina . he also presented his research in the scientific papers of karl popper.kosciuszko was named a chevalier of the order of merit of the german empire in 1958 .

gandhi supported the `` benevolent seigneurialism `` of lord mountbatten , which made it easier for poor people to access equal opportunities in politics . he endorsed the idea of building a canal through burma , and by contrast the legacy of the 1870 british invasion of india , after india was separated from the british empire , led to the erosion of his legacy . he was also an advocate of provincial autonomy . he was an advocate of equal funding for schools .

a cast of civil servants from the indian government led by lord mountbatten , gandhi 's predecessor , led a wave of anti-colonial activism in india from 1960 to 1962 . this movement successfully brought about reforms that have made india a leader in many disciplines and inventions .

paul was born in hervrain . his father , paul-émile paul ( 1899–1970 ) was a rabbi in hervrain who obtained his doctorate in 1907 . his mother was marie bolsøde ( 1903–1971 ) , a social worker with a local health service . she first met her son in 1919 when he visited hervrain . he was trained to be a chemist and since 1920 had a philosophy degree with a minor in mathematics at the university of aarhus . in 1926 , he took an assistant professorship in the same department at the university of copenhagen . there , he would make the first observations in cortical stimulation .

== research ==
niederlinder 's first published papers were dedicated to stimulus complexity and experimental experimental methods in visual processing . these studies led him to the discovery of visual evoked potentials , leading him to explore the aspects of vision in animal vision . he also investigated delayed flickering of cells , which he later expanded on in the study of the visual system . his major contributions to perceptual complexity came after he started studying primate sight and visual cognition , with special emphasis on visual pathways . this work consisted mainly of field studies and other investigations of visual perception and knowledge.he was the last author of the 1926 publication sertraline und chiraline ( perception and naming ) . in 1927 , he published the review lettres chirérales ( 3 chapters ) and repeated it in two more publications , the final one in 1947 . niederlinder became interested in the perception of color , concentrating especially on color , and later became interested in cognitive performance of blind individuals.his best-known book was blokbedingelseseverkeskij , de chiréraliged og og chiréralisk ( psychological aspects of brightness , or the perceptual-cognitive laws of color ) ( 1953 ) . that work explores several aspects of color vision , and includes perceptual complexity and chromaticity as observed in blind individuals . it also analyses brain activity while perceiving color .

dr. wallace christopher macmillan ( 1848–1928 ) was a british geologist and paleontologist .


== life ==
he was born in warrington , lancashire , the son of christopher macmillan and mary watson macmillan . in his youth he lived at palmerston road in gloucestershire and he was apprenticed as a builder . during the second world war he joined the royal irish academy as a physical instructor . he continued with the academy after the war . he later served as an assistant to john william watson in his laboratory at cambridge . in addition to work in mathematical engineering and mineralogy , he also taught at the school and , in 1951 , was elected as a fellow of the royal society of london . he was elected a fellow of the geological society of london in 1921 . he served as the assistant to dr. c. w. d. harrison from 1925 to 1929 . in 1932 he was appointed as senior lecturer in palaeontology at the geological survey of india . from 1928 to 1932 he was research fellow in india , and from 1936 to 1939 from the geological survey of india .


== publications ==
sir david peachhill describes him as follows :

dr. macmillan gave much of his efforts to providing a comprehensive and easy-to-read account of the taxonomy of jurassic marine strata and the later palaeozoic , but especially the dinosaur fauna ; a volume of handbills on the subject was first published at the geological society in 1924 under the title the fossil reptiles of india . this book was followed by several supplementary books that advanced the age and complexity of the reptiles by providing their relations and structure with fossil invertebrates and birds . to his credit , dr. macmillan solved the difficult problem of dinosaurs in connection with the earlier palaeozoic ; though it has become quite complex as the many craniological groups have arisen from the animal families , in the review of a little more than a hundred papers on the subject he declared that he had exhausted all others and made the necessary work himself . his earlier work , with gilbert brown , l. m. mason , and j. j. cabot , illustrated certain classic concerns in palaeontology , but dr. macmillan explained them in a manner that was scientific and straight-forward . his text on strata of the jurassic age has been very useful as a unit for studies of the petrified wood of the jurassic , particularly of the cretaceous , and its application in the study of palaeontology has been largely due to his work .


== family ==

macmillan was the son of dr. john cameron macmillan and mary watson macmillan .

== early life ==
balfour was born on 7 september 1861 at the parish of st gregory 's , braintree , the son of daniel philip balfour and elizabeth solly . his family were from the lowland isles in south-eastern england where his father was a priest . his paternal grandfather was the churchwarden of port barrow in kent and a younger sister , eliza ethel balfour . balfour was educated at the local school and the university . he won a scholarship and attended trinity college , cambridge university for two years ( 1862–1863 ) where he became interested in mathematics .


== career ==
balfour initially taught as a lecturer at the college in which he was a fellow of trinity , and at many schools and colleges , such as york and linlithgow . his first post was as demonstrator in political science at the royal naval academy in bristol ( 1863–1866 ) . the government thought that the man who could teach mechanics was inferior to the man who could teach philosophy , and in this way balfour was deprived of a post in physics . balfour was able to earn a university commission at the start of 1868 when he was awarded a scholarship to teach practical natural science and philosophy to the royal naval academy in london , lecturing on subjects such as hydraulics , mechanics , geology , astronomy , mining , and other related subjects . his trip to europe helped him advance his mathematical education and gained him an early reputation as an unusually good teacher . balfour was not , however , appointed assistant of the philosophical department but rather lecturer in philosophy ; this would prove a great career advancement , and he became professor of philosophy and art in 1881 . this position ( which he held until he retired in 1929 ) was largely due to the pioneering work of joseph schur . balfour 's students included arthur lyttelton and sir james george frazer .

= harold klehr =
harold elvin `` harro `` klehr ( november 16 , 1919 – november 22 , 2002 ) was an american microbiologist .


== early life ==
harold klehr was born in portland , oregon , on november 16 , 1919 . he earned his undergraduate degree in 1940 from the university of oregon , where he was supervised by eric jordan . at oregon , he was associated with the oregon biological research laboratory ( apl ) , the only laboratory open to undergraduates and where he received his phd in 1942 . his ph.d. thesis explored the structure of bacteria , which led him to become interested in cytology , the study of living cells , under prof. robert scheer at the johns hopkins school of medicine . in 1945 , he accepted an appointment as assistant professor of biochemistry at the university of wisconsin-madison , where he remained until 1956 , and then associate professor of microbiology until he became professor emeritus in 1969 . in 1953 , he retired as a professor emeritus and returned to teaching at the university of wisconsin–madison . he was made professor emeritus in 1967 , but he died of stomach cancer in 2002 .


== work ==

he discovered that streptococcus pneumoniae lives in the cell wall of the human fetus . the scientific name of the organism is strep-pneumoniae , after his birthplace and his laboratory , in portland , oregon . in an effort to illustrate his observations in a quantitative manner , he called the organism a bacteria . klehr later spent more than half a century trying to understand this compound organism and how it might work . in the early days of his career , klehr studied hemolytic uremic syndrome , which he thought was caused by a virus , but later concluded it was caused by a protease enzyme , a biological material that by now is commonly believed to be involved in the generation of and maintenance of protein fibrils . klehr 's experiments also demonstrated that microorganisms break down proteins involved in cell wall development in vitro , in the presence of other proteins such as tyrosine and uridine .

the enzyme klehr created in his lab is called klehr 's kinase , for short . klehr later invented his kinase as a new treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes . it was later proven that these particles , known as transporters , are produced by klehr 's kinase in response to amino acids in the blood , serving as the bioelectric system for the disease . it is unknown if these particles act as a signal for other cells to activate the protein fibrils needed to maintain cells in their normal state .
klehr discovered that , like living cells , the inorganic structures of bacteria incorporate properties of the organic substances they are made of . an example is his experimental demonstration of the point , the organelle that separates sperm from egg cells , which appears as two rows of bioluminescent protoplasm that separate the two.because he and his colleague paul r. schmitt named bacteria after klehr and scheer , the bacterium klehrostoma is named after him in reference to his discovery .


== collaboration ==
klehr 's most prominent student was developmental biologist oliver sacks , jr. , a co-author of the neutron enzymology of the worm . klehr 's laboratory was later established at the department of microbiology and immunology at the columbia university medical center .


== awards ==
professor emeritus in 1970

== biography ==
fonberg was born in teplice , voronezh oblast , russia . in his early years he took a prestigious course in the subjects of chemistry , physics and astronomy at the lomonosov moscow state university . in 1943 he graduated as an international master of science in soviet mathematics and astronomy . he then took a place as an assistant at the lyman beale observatory in new mexico , and during world war ii his laboratory at lomonosov moscow state university began to produce soviet astronomy equipment . after the armistice he and boris padral were among the first group of personnel working on soviet magnetic instrumentation.in 1946 , fonberg was sent to the united states and worked as an assistant at the united states national bureau of standards in pullman , washington . he joined the soviet astronomical institute of experimental physics in 1948 as an assistant in the laboratory of semyon blizhnyak . the following year , he was promoted to associate in the scientific staff at the lowell observatory . in 1953 he became an instructor in the laboratory of theoretical physics in the ussr academy of sciences . there he was responsible for the development of their russian magnetic observatory . in 1958 he became an advisor in the theoretical department at the space research institute of the ussr academy of sciences , from which he was given an honorary doctorate by the university . in 1968 , he was the head of the research institute 's chemical field group . in the course of his 30-year career he co-authored more than 2,000 scientific articles , the majority of them published in scientific journals .


== research group ==
the group focused on research of the slow oscillations and refractive indices of molecular systems and some problems in theoretical physics . fonberg joined the research group in 1950 . within the group his development focused on the speed and the phenomena of solar radiation , variable refraction and scattering of high-energy electrons , the mechanics of the solar corona and ionization of the solar cells and energetic cosmic rays . other areas of focus included the overall structure of cosmic rays , particles in interstellar space , and quantum physics.fonberg organized seminars in natural science research ; photometry , the theory of polarization , and the theory of ionization of gases . he published book reviews , monographs , and articles . in 1956 he received a fellowship from the national academy of sciences of the united states . fonberg retired in 1969 and was appointed an administrator of the experimental physics institute of the ussr academy of sciences .


== teaching and collaboration ==
a noted teacher , fonberg was considered a prominent researcher and a colleague . with his voluminous output he was able to combine breadth of knowledge with an essential ability to apply this knowledge in a very short period of time . he was able to show that very short pulses of radio-frequency energy can produce ionization of the gas atoms , and that in superposed states of quasi-random and different-shaped gas atoms , the expected behavior of this phenomenon is apparent . this highly original research was appreciated by students and their colleagues in different research groups , and in the field of classical physics and astronomy . he also was a committed and highly productive collaborator , which led to many students having an influence on his own research efforts .
he was one of the most noted and accessible scientists in the theoretical physics department . in 1958 he received the prestigious lev nedelman prize and was elected to the ussr academy of sciences . in 1973 the academy of sciences honoured him with the `` doctor of the ussr `` ( ussr : professorialoita sovietskikh ionomeni ) .

william f. agnew ( june 20 , 1876 – april 1 , 1935 ) was an american pharmacologist and bacteriologist , whose early career as an administrator at imperial chemical industries and major roles in the development of penicillin may have set the stage for the development of antibiotic drugs .


== early life and education ==
agnew was born in brooklyn , new york , the son of james and catharine agnew . he attended the victor lincoln high school of woodbridge , vermont . he received his b.s . degree in medicine from harvard in 1895 and his m.d . from johns hopkins in 1902 .


== scientific career ==
he became a major member of the government 's chemical laboratory in baltimore , maryland , and a leading purveyor of penicillin , as early as 1897 . in 1900 he received a federal appointment as assistant under secretary of the interior in charge of the bureau of standards , which gave him direct control over all federal research . this was particularly important in coordination with the government 's chemical research laboratory at argonne national laboratory , where agnew was the first to synthesize penicillin . in 1903 he was elected as a member of the national academy of sciences . he became a professor of medicine at harvard university in 1905 , and went on to lead a large pharmaceutical firm until his death .


== activism for antibiotic therapy ==
in 1894 , agnew and his colleague joseph a. rosamilia realized that penicillin was as good a prophylactic vaccine as could be developed . in an 1897 paper , they published that an antibiotic working as well as anti-bacterial would kill 120 times as many germs as a standard penicillin formulation . this was greatly aided by the discovery of diphtheria toxin , in which penicillin contained 5 parts of the toxin , while the standard penicillin contained around 2 parts . agnew called for penicillin producers to be better prepared to develop new antibiotics , both for their own use and to research which antibiotics would be effective in higher cases . because penicillin was not available to the us at the time , these calls led to agnew and his associates being able to quickly produce their purified penicillin . though the published paper was controversial , it became the first documented example of penicillin being given a popular prescription.when franklin d. roosevelt became president in 1933 , agnew joined with other major penicillin manufacturers in urging fdr to abolish the division of soils , a division that involved natural resources and imported chemicals . agnew was concerned that this would have a very negative effect on the viability of the industry , as minerals and certain foreign chemicals were considered vital to the production and use of penicillin . further , by removing pressure from the government , control of penicillin would have become more tightly controlled and would have left the industry with no option but to continue to provide inexpensive injections . agnew was a strong advocate of the national government league ( ngl ) , a movement led by the world anti-fascist league ( wwa ) , which opposed the nazi takeover of germany and argued that , if the nazis did manage to take over germany , it would make the new government effective at preserving the jewish people , and should leave the united states free and open to global cooperation . agnew and his ngl were appointed to a house committee in 1934 , but their influence was limited as anti-nazi forces dominated public opinion .


== death and legacy ==
agnew died at the age of 81 in 1937 .


== personal life ==
agnew was the son of james and catharine agnew , and he married mary maud ocher and had two daughters , margaret ( born 1904 ) and deborah ( born 1906 ) . agnew had three sons , frank agnew and william walter agnew , two brothers , herbert a. and james brian , and a sister , ann .

robert hayne ( 17 may 1883 , in london – 16 january 1973 ) was a british archaeologist who led excavations of palaeolithic sites in yorkshire for over 20 years . he is credited with elucidating the relationship between these areas and the later neolithic . he is best known for his successful excavations of nearby wybarr stone in the yorkshire channel .
hayne was educated at trinity college , cambridge and then spent some time at calcutta normal school before beginning his career . in 1898 , he took part in the construction of the bailey school , and his practical teaching of geology helped forge a lasting friendship with the school 's headmaster , james ritchie .


== career ==
in 1906 , hayne joined the yorkshire institute of archaeology as a research assistant and was given a ten-month leave of absence to build the bailey school ( now the edward archer school ) . by 1913 , he and ritchie were both forced to resign from their posts over anti-social behaviour in the school .
hayne 's later excavations , however , were never wholly successful . in 1922–1923 , he led the excavations at shropshire , meath and shrewsbury where he continued to lead important excavations , which included several sites important to science . these included the first known ( at that time ) effigy of a homo erectus from the prehistoric period , the first known human presence on a homogenous village , and a village cart and altar found in northern shropshire . these discoveries allowed hayne to believe that the site had once been used by nomadic hunter-gatherers as a prosperous trading town . this work , and hayne 's attempts to rebut the prevailing theory of the stone age , led to him being appointed a palaeolithic archaeologist to the british museum in 1923 , and he wrote the monograph eruption of the shropshire site : the shropshire site , first appearing in 1937.in 1922–1925 , hayne led the excavation at redhill , kendal , near leeds , where he named a suite of neolithic rock types known as vesiculites ( that was the name by which they are usually known today ) , the first species of rock and stone whose name had been established in english by william wilson in 1905 . following the excavation of the city , he conducted further excavations at leicester and leicester 's bay , further sequences at wakefield , sunderland , shrewsbury , wigglesworth and bridgewater . he also led excavations at guernsey , which opened in 1930 .


== other interests ==
in the 1920s , hayne also wrote a series of popular and popular books and articles about archaeology and human history . he was a co-founder of the british folklore society and chaired its council for the next 27 years . he was a senior lecturer at cambridge and was its vice-president from 1937 until 1951 . he was also a co-founder and university organiser of the archeological society , and its president from 1959 until 1961 . he received a knighthood from the queen for his services to archaeology in the 1930s and the procurator general of the british museum , for services to archaeology during world war ii.hayne and ritchie formed a close and lasting friendship , lasting until his death , during which time he encouraged ritchie to publish his papers on the stone age , until ritchie wrote them . although hayne enjoyed the company of many archaeologists , he was not granted permission to associate with any one particular person .

daniel nehemiah jensen ( november 23 , 1863 – december 8 , 1938 ) was an american metallurgist and engineer . he was noted for his work in refining galvanic and epithermal materials . he is best known for the concept of what he called `` magnetic coating `` which is a structural process whereby metal is coated with a molecular composition or layers of tiny electrons . this technique has been used to improve an engineer 's ability to operate a machine or process and provide for high quality control.jensen was born on november 23 , 1863 in denver , colorado . his parents were zora n. jensen , a pioneer in bird breeding , and james ronald jensen , a pioneer in forest forestry . daniel jensen attended rocky mountain high school and attended the university of denver college . jensen completed a doctoral degree in chemistry and mechanical engineering from the university of chicago in 1876 .


== biography ==


=== education and career ===
jensen was a charter member of the yale football club , which became the professional football team of the university of colorado . in 1879 , jensen was appointed professor of metallurgy and metallurgy at the university of denver . jensen was a pioneer in the use of epithermal compounds to enhance steel corrosion resistance and also applied for patent 7,193,527 `` magnetic covering of steel `` . this was the first patent granted to the u.s. in 1901 .


=== discovery of magnetic coating ===
jensen was also active as a long-distance runner and was known for his intense running regimen . he embarked on a seven-week road trip from denver to san francisco in may , 1882 and covered 120 miles in seven days . jensen noticed that during his 60-mile trek he lost 10 pounds . jensen spent over six months recording his findings using several logbooks , nearly doubling the number of hours of exertion at his disposal , and being advised by the scientific community to study this discovery closely . his work is now known to be the very first scientific research to explore the phenomenon of microspikes on solids , cement and ice . with the authority of his patents , jensen and henry ramsay began the first research involving a microspike problem .


=== more exciting discoveries ===
his contemporaries noticed jensen 's creative talent . the boulder herald-journal wrote about `` the accidental discovery of a newly developed application of improved technique , 'magnetic coating , `` stating that :

what gives jensen special effect when applied to steel and other soft and brittle materials is his astuteness in using metallic and chemical barriers . these qualities and more are the result of a series of experiments on melted metals , cement and calcite. `` jensen added that his discoveries would now `` explain the deposition of microspikes in automobile brakes , bridges and automobiles `` .


== longevity ==
his preferred term to describe his innovative work is `` dazzling `` , and was used by james ramsay in a well-known quote : `` the clever old man says that god is everywhere , and i can only say that i believe him . `` jensen was employed by the university of colorado , one of the largest universities in the united states , for the duration of his career and was awarded 28 patents for his research and other contributions to industrial matters.jensen married augusta ellen stinchfield ( 1873–1949 ) in 1889 , and had two children , henry ( 1898–1973 ) , who would become a distinguished u.s. army colonel , and elizabeth ann ( 1903–1998 ) . he died in boulder on december 8 , 1938 , after a long illness .

= emile chabrier =
emile chabrier ( 2 april 1899 – 27 march 1973 ) was a french writer . his first novel , les fils chapelles ( the filthy workmen ) , was first published in 1923 , and was followed in 1926 by the poem the times of helen ( love the voice ) , which became a book in french . in 1929 he wrote les princes de l'homme . the song of the proletariat ( 1928 ) and american golden wire ( 1930 ) were great hits in the united states , and chabrier had begun publishing in canada in 1931 . chabrier died in 1973 in gaspé-et-marne , where he had lived since 1924 .
chabrier wrote fiction in both literary form and popular expression . although chabrier regarded himself as a writer , he was not a strictly literary person , as he professed a hatred of them . while he had few literary friends , he did have excellent friends , with whom he continued to write . chabrier 's writing for this art sometimes struck a chord with readers of the various publications that he had published over the years . the positive reviews of les fils chapelles were certainly part of this .
chabrier was the son of a merchant family of smallpox survivors , the grandson of captain jean lavergne ( 1882-1969 ) of the sea service , and nephew of charles lucien chabrier . his family was `` middle class `` in a fashion that changed over his career , but in the general métier of his family and friends his father and grandfather had both been distinguished poets and writers . chabrier 's life was devoted to resistance , if such a thing could be called it ; he decided against the career path of the `` proletarian `` of france , the `` young officer , , without capital. `` however , `` he could not remain behind his wife and two children at home. `` following the widespread introduction of automatic weapons and the arrival of airplanes at his grandparents'house in the 1880s , he dropped the army as he came of age . in 1930 he moved to his maternal grandfather 's house , which still stood in the village of racine . this influenced his later novels . the chabriers were nonconformist huguenots , and chabrier was always pro-german .
chabrier 's autobiographical novel , in search of god , gives a portrait of 18th-century puritan society , of a grand-father with ambitious ambition , and of his son , philippe , the rascal who scatters champignons among the disaffected by jumping out of a window while drunk and winds up with his trousers pulled back on a second time . after returning to society , chabrier again resolves to write novels : only for money ! his first couple of novels , in 1930 and 1937 , were widely reprinted , making them a bestseller.chabrier produced the works from his mid-nineties , e.g . 1957 , which drew large-scale crowds at cons , became a novella , many a lengthy fanfic , the opera les princes de l'homme ( 1830–1853 ) , and the first volumes of his popular short story collection les princes d'amour ( 1938 ) .

sir theodore hall , frs ( 1829 – 2 april 1921 ) was a scottish physicist who made contributions in the field of statistical mechanics . he published 13 papers on physics in the journal of applied physiology , which he edited , and nine in the physical review .


== biography ==
hall was born in edinburgh to john hamilton hall , a surgeon , and his wife hester hall . he studied at king 's college london , gaining his doctorate in 1858 . in 1864 he joined royal college of surgeons of edinburgh , where he was head of the laboratory and junior lecturer in 1869–75 . from 1876 until his retirement in 1917 he was an associate professor at the university of edinburgh . in 1879 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh , and in 1887 a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh . hall served as president of the physical society from its inception in 1883–84 .


== theories ==
hall was influenced by isaac newton 's principia and james clerk maxwell 's influential work in statistical mechanics . he suggested that statistical mechanics had the advantage of being fast and accurate , while classical mechanics was of little interest for the purpose of establishing how a small world operated . hall saw that , although the quantity of particles was small , the amount of energy required to propel each particle was large , and the law of conservation of mass must be true , because as one particle traveled through a sphere , it lost energy from traveling backwards . this law must hold , in the case of a sphere , if all the particles in it exist in a single space , i.e. , if the velocity of each particle as it travels through a circle increases linearly with the square of the radius . thus , hall 's theorem can be expressed as

== early life and education ==
baker was born in southwark , the son of a linen manufacturer , to eustace baker , a commercial printer , and rebecca anne . edward was educated at king 's college , london , and then at harvard university . at the recommendation of daniel halley , his father converted to the methodist religion in 1757 . baker entered king 's college in 1759 , graduating in 1762 with an ma . his studies were interrupted by both a distinguished career as a gentleman of the yeomanry and a tutoring position at the royal society of edinburgh . baker became a member of the edinburgh philosophical society in 1765 , a free member in 1767 , and an honorary member in 1783 .


== life at harvard ==
during his time at harvard , baker attended the meeting of the harvard academy for 1767–71 .
in 1772 baker was appointed professor of philosophy in the college of physicians of harvard university , named as such by the rector and the chancellor of harvard , alexander h. putnam . he was very successful in this position , serving as president from 1778 to 1784 .
while at harvard , baker served as a student , was on the staff of one of the medical societies of england , and was president of the american philosophical society for two terms . his father contributed to the society , and he had regular employment with it , including secretary to many of the founders .
in 1783 , baker entered the chair of natural philosophy and physics at harvard , being elected first professor in 1791 . in 1795 he received the degree of doctor of letters . he was president of the yale university association for 1823 and 1825 .
baker was the author of fourteen works :
a moral aspect of the wealth of nations : containing a treatise on wealth , agriculture and commerce
a practical remarks on the principle of cause and effect
on inequality of authority
recent observations on the secession of monopolies and trade-unions
on the loss of ground in the advance of science
a treatise on the law of parallel forces
on the ideal basis of the mechanism of matter
on certain entire points of logic and metaphysics
a treatise on metaphysics
on natural history in defence of natural philosophy
observations on the natural representations of the different types of images and the enumeration of images
the moral science and philosophy of thomas george cromwell : a contribution to its growth and useful application to the advancement of man ( 1784 ) , was published after baker 's death , with copious notes , as a compendium of his thought .
baker died in harvard hospital on january 6 , 1802 .


== legacy ==
edward baker was known as a `` man of science `` . he was a student of john locke and benjamin franklin , and argued both theories at a very early age . baker 's predictions of the revolutionary consequences of scientific change were very much like those of the supporters of the spread of the spread of racial purity theory during the 20th century .
on his death , harvard president james madison dedicated his life to baker 's memory . baker 's statistics , his well known library , and his devotion to this cause are often cited in his memory . his final retirement was motivated by a family tradition of extreme adherance to the constitutionality of the american university system.although edward baker is commemorated by both the harvard university namesakes of nicholas rees and john baker and is addressed by some as the father of a philosophy of science , he did not work for , nor in turn , advance , physics .

hoffmann was born in vienna to an early merchant family . his father was a wine merchant . in the summer of 1687 , he went on an expedition to altdorf to explore some local caves . hoffmann quickly became interested in alchemy and quickly understood the nature of alchemy , so much so that he started to teach himself , being able to make much more advanced scientific studies.in 1692 , hoffmann began work on a grand-project of his own , and an early draft of what is now the altdorf encyclopædia of science was finished in august 1693 , under the direction of the young altdorf chemist johannes heinrich beltrammieck . after beltrammieck died in 1706 , it was relocated to trier , where the work was continued by maria widor for two more years . the standard author abbreviation hahn is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .
in 1803 , hoffmann started a natural philosophy with his phd student johannes gatt . in the natural philosophy , such as the ideas of wave mechanics , the self , and pareto principle , had developed , and it is probable that he was the first natural philosopher to propose these ideas in a scientific manner .
in 1808 , hoffmann published his neue naturalphilosophie in traktordnung , or an elementary alphabet of practical philosophy ( 한만프로 마프한만프한프프 ) . in the 17th century , he started using the three-letter abbreviation hahn , an abbreviation of the french word haber , which means `` book of theories `` .in 1811 , johann abraham cramer began hahn 's work on hydrostatics , a mathematical system he had invented in collaboration with paulus nicolaus jacobus holst and his friend georg matthias gane ( also known as johann abraham ) . hahn considered his methodology the most useful , although he never used this method in his own works . he is sometimes referred to as the `` father of hydrostatics `` by some biographers and biographical sources.hoffmann was buried in paderborn , in berlin .

as we have seen , eigenvalues of homotopy groups are local when the curvature of the equation is negative and the sum of its subgroups is positive . this is generally the case in fixed points . however , n-trees containing only edges are then of negligible degree of curvature because their non-n-separable part has large singularities , and therefore all other simplifications need to be performed as there are large numbers of partial derivatives of the derivatives . such elimination is known as paucity-shaping .
in everyday functional analysis , small subgroups of a structure have ordered representations , as illustrated in

= ernst hans homann =
ernst hans homann ( 20 september 1880 – 22 february 1961 ) was a german theoretical physicist , author , and physiologist . he is credited with coining the term energy and with establishing a scientific theory of waves , galvanic effect , absorption of light by water , and the particle and wave analyzer theory . homann invented the prism microscope , which was introduced by charles wheatstone in 1904 , in his book `` optics and photometry. `` in 1921 homann successfully demonstrated the existence of the pauli–ribbon effect , and he proved the existence of the lamb shift in the quantum field theory . he believed the mass of electron vibrations for small particles , the lorentz transform of these vibrations , and the lorentz transformation of solutions of hilbert space geometry were significantly smaller than the planck length of their wavelength .


== life ==
son of a teacher in halle , homann studied physics and mathematics at the technical university of munich , graduating in 1893 . in 1905 , at the age of 23 , he became a laboratory assistant to wolfgang pauli . in 1908 homann , along with his assistant ernest toussaint , showed that electron waves appear to have separate nuclei , which is as far from the prediction of special relativity as it was possible at that time to put forth . homann 's work contributed greatly to the field of electromagnetic theory and was cited by friedrich zinn in his theoretical derivation of the concept of `` systematic relativity `` . in 1921 he demonstrated the existence of the pauli–ribbon effect , a phenomenon that describes the phenomenon of induced resonances of phonons when they are distorted by an electric field . it is associated with the electric lens phenomena of optical transmission .
homann was a founding editor of the journal physikalische zeitschrift .
in 1913 homann was awarded a grant by the munich pharmacological society to establish the institute of physiology in munich . with the help of paul grün , he founded the technical university of munich-chemical institute of biophysics and pharmacology , now in its 25th year of existence .
after the outbreak of world war i , homann made contributions to physics through experimental work in magnetism . in 1919 he was elected to membership of the vertebrat in the german people 's party ( dvp ) , with the dvp becoming a separate electoral party in 1920 . in 1922 homann , along with friedrich schwarzschild , discovered the emission of x-rays with cesium . from 1924 homann was a member of the newly formed science and education commission for the first scientific congress of the federation of german scientists and engineers .

rudolf william hehr cie ( 22 june 1855 – 8 august 1936 ) was a british chemist and polymath .


== biography ==
born in hartley , lancashire , hehr was the son of the doctor and insurance agent edward hehr , a younger brother of thomas , the fellow ship-owner . he was educated at cadbury school and then at st albans grammar school .
at the age of 19 hehr was appointed assistant to john james audubon in the zoology department at the london zoo , where he studied taxonomy , evolution and embryology . in 1883 he left zoology and returned to hartley , becoming privatdozent to the alfred smythian society . in 1887 , with an honorary doctorate , he was elected a fellow of the royal society . in 1889 , when hehr was a curator at the natural history museum , he became professor of botany , and spent many months in croatia in 1888-90 . he received an honorary doctorate from st john 's college , cambridge in 1905 , also awarded an honorary lld from heriot-watt .
he married in 1894 susanna agnes macgregor knox , daughter of william knox , mp ( 1792–1873 ) . they had one son , paul macgregor knox ( 1895–1955 ) , and two daughters : marion john knox ( 1900–1994 ) , who was a retired judge , and elizabeth jane knox ( 1900–1976 ) .
he continued his studies of cryptogams , especially new diseases and their treatments , and published `` a comprehensive description of the coluberia virus and its careers ( recent journal ) `` , in 1896 .
he retired in 1937 and was appointed professor of polymath at cambridge in 1937 . his publications include :

herbert garrett wessels : the origins of inflation ( 1900 )
william eno wessels : structures of avian anatomy ( 1904 )
william eno wessels : physical statistics ( 1912 )


== inventions and discoveries ==
hehr devised the ay-angle headlamp in 1887 . it was used in the aviation industry from the mid-1920s , but only in the early days of world war ii . the prototype consisted of a single cam mirror mounted at the tip of a branch which could be tilted on the face of a hook ( now used by mountaineers ) , with which a light bulb could be attached , allowing a constant angle between the two . he had a special arrangement for this lamp which opened for the wearer , allowing light onto the head which was obscured by the hook to enter . the headlamp was of a flat design , with a hook at the tip ( which opened onto an `` arch `` ) and a sliding plate within which the bulb was suspended from the barrel ( so it could be rotated backwards , for example as in a pencil eraser ) . from 1907 to 1909 it was used in britain by raf pilots . in the autumn of 1907 the headlamp was tested successfully on the usgs 's experimental aircraft desert storm .
the haptic insulator used by the royal aircraft establishment for the aps was later called the hehr-type , in honour of william rudolf hoch .

= william dower maney =
william dower maney ( october 11 , 1879 – february 13 , 1964 ) was an american industrialist and inventor . maney is also known for coining the terms `` high tech `` and `` low tech `` to refer to the new ideas and processes he introduced to increase the productivity of manufacturers and consumers of durable goods and services .


== early life and education ==
dower maney was born on october 11 , 1879 , in bedford , massachusetts . he attended brown university , graduated from harvard university , and received a bachelor 's degree from brown in 1923 . he joined the u.s. navy as a private in 1912 , as part of an ad hoc program of services by the united states government 's medical and scientific communities to obtain volunteers to search for marine petroleum supplies , and to treat it with hydrocarbons and other chemical solvents that were not normally used . during this period he did various research at the massachusetts institute of technology and was appointed instructor in marine engineering in 1923 . maney received his doctorate from harvard in 1929 .


== industrial career ==
after the war ended , maney joined a washington , d.c. consulting firm called mein & bee , where he developed his original ideas about the concept of flow control and power transference , which are now known as maney 's law and maney flow . thereafter , he was a consultant to such businesses as general electric and xerox . dower maney 's first big contribution to the functional analysis industry was his work on industrial electronics and the design of a prototype world class electric oscillating typewriter known as the cybuzz . a few years later , maney started working with electrical engineering at general electric , where he began developing industrial electrical engineering in the form of his maney flow model for generating electrical conductivity . the problem that led to his patent of his grid transition technology was the dearth of suitable data on the long distance flux of conductive fluids and the principal concern was to find out the changes in wire resistance and the rate of transmission of the charge carriers . this work turned his thinking from the generation of path length and direction of discharges to the functional relations between the conductive fluxes and the electrical properties of the materials that comprise the circuit .
as a result of his research and development , most electrical devices are now constructed with specific characteristics in mind . for instance , in the early 1920s , maney found that the temperature difference between a conducting conductor and a conducting metal became dramatically greater , creating a much larger load on that metal . for maney , a large structural element was needed to actually make the flow control the critical characteristic of the process : a metal junction . in 1926 , he founded the electric shocky glass manufacturing company for which he designed the first steel-coated glass cutters.it was maney 's deep research into industrial electrical engineering that led to his patent of the modern industrial flow control system , the maney transducers , developed with ( among others ) russell wood ( 1901–1970 ) , e.a.w . miller ( 1917–1988 ) , fred robinson ( 1919–2010 ) , w.w.s . dimick ( 1913–1992 ) , g.w.m . callister ( 1914–1966 ) , walter reich ( 1921–1990 ) , werner ihmüller ( 1934–1999 ) , john e. walker ( 1926–2008 ) , robert g. wayne ( 1940–1996 ) and frank lee ( 1936–2005 ) . a subsidiary of bell labs , mein & bee helped create the world-class telephone wire current transducers , designed for use in some of the earliest telephone systems .


== personal life ==
maney died on february 13 , 1964 , in princeton , new jersey . maney is survived by his wife , katharine maney ; four daughters , mary i. , jane , jane , amy and betty ; and a son , robert w. maney .

in early 1813 he left britain in the himalayas on an expedition led by captain william marvell ( 1733–1819 ) and captain alexander thomson ( 1732–1834 ) , and proceeded through iran , iraq , and through persia into iraq . this journey , based on speculation , of browning 's description of the city of susa in bactria , was conducted at a cost of £56,400.in 1814 , browning travelled to java to recruit new colonists , and then to johore and java on a second expedition . this time he enlisted the assistance of other europeans , including samuel forbes ( 1752–1823 ) , william millar ( 1766–1840 ) and captain joseph cockayne ( 1777–1857 ) . both expeditions failed in singapore .
during the period of his professional and legal career , browning tried to sell a collection of fish , along with specimens , to the bombay magazine for $ 65,000 ( about £28,000 then ) . the collection included 26 tons of shark fins , but browning saw the sale as a colossal waste .
in 1820 , he returned to london to become the `` counselor `` to the bombay university in what was to become the city of bombay . there he undertook medical experiments on hungry prisoners in a newly designed institution , and was badly beaten by his colleagues in a medical trial after which he died .

== career ==
he was director of the physics division at the united states air force observatory in the department of physics and technology in the latter part of world war ii . he co-founded the society for experimental physics in 1931 .
he was the first to propose the metalliferous-particle idea in the early 1940s . his ideas were included in the adjacent future section of the third edition of arthur b. compton 's the distant future : on science , man , and the law of acceleration.he was among the first to experimentally investigate electrostatic discharge in electricity . he became president of the american physical society in 1941 , the national president in 1947 , and , during the 1930s , served as chairman of the american physical society . he also became director of the national bureau of standards and was in charge of the nsa 's second atomic energy commission.pollak was also responsible for assigning the first atomic energy collision survey to the united states government , in 1946 .
in 1950 pollak became the first president of the american physical society , and served from 1953 until 1962 .
pollak was a member of several committees in the united states and abroad . the 'the intergovernmental panel on climate change ' , created by the united nations under un auspices , was a predecessor of the world meteorological organization.pollak was the first to demonstrate ionospheric temperature response in 1946 , and the first to demonstrate the correlation between changes in atmospheric humidity and temperature changes , which is an important feedback to both dynamic and absolute variations in atmospheric temperature.pollak was a notable proponent of accelerated aging . his research suggested that people live longer than expected , and he speculated that the possible impact of aging on health would be affected by an increase in bone loss . he used retrograde hypoxia , a form of hydrostatic stress that he perceived as detrimental to both medical functioning and human well-being . this occurred due to an increased incidence of reactive oxygen species , which is a key to a wide range of medical problems , including hypertension , asthma , cardiovascular problems and even cancer .

= helen lee =
helen lee frs frse ( 14 august 1885 – 8 november 1968 ) was a british statistician who specialised in the life tables , and later particularly on the life tables . she founded the life tables society .


== life tables ==
lee first devised the , and promoted , the `` life tables `` , the first collection of these tables which gave detailed information on various aspects of health and survival of those with various medical conditions . in 1913 she added detail about physical health for miners , the minimum level of drinking water required for health and metabolic strength for pregnant women , and so on .
lee 's life tables became the basis of statistical methods and research from the 1920s to the 1950s . at the time , world war i was raging , and there was a need to research what a war based on war would mean for the populations in other parts of the world . however , lee considered such calculations in any force to be impractical , because populations in war zones also lived in different environments which would affect the health of their populations , and all data from places in the war zones was vital to future generations to help make any scientific predictions.lee and her husband , thomas emery lee , conceived of the subject based on her experience of being sick and in constant need of the emergency hospital . lee had to measure movement of vital organs throughout her body . these vital statistics she was able to obtain from patients were essential to the development of war rationing during world war i and later . the methods she devised became known as the emery and lee 's decision theory .


== awards and honours ==
lee was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1921 and became a foreign member of the american academy of arts and sciences ( 1921 ) , foreign member of the linnean society ( 1924 ) , and foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 1925 ) . in 1950 , she was appointed a companion of the order of the british empire .
in 1975 lee was elected to the queen ’ s birthday honours list for public services in `` peace , women ’ s and the world , the british department of international affairs and the united nations , 's. `` her 100th birthday is celebrated annually on 20 may .

= ingemar craczkow =
ingemar craczkow ( polish pronunciation : [ ˈisːɡaːlka ] ; 23 february 1920 – 20 november 1986 ) was a polish economist who , with nikolai stokolsky , used financial statistics to develop mathematical models to construct theories of trade and production cycles . these models subsequently played an important role in the stork–stokolsky equation , a widely cited economic calculation that is one of the best predictors of future economic performance .


== life ==
craczkow was born to a family of impoverished polish parents , of jewish descent . craczkow studied at warsaw state university . his advisor was a young economist named jacek kalkar , who had , like craczkow , been heavily influenced by his father . in 1926 , craczkow graduated from warsaw state university , and became a full professor there , winning the `` prestigious dylusk prize `` ( 1938 ) for his work in actuarial economics .
craczkow founded the polish statistical society ( 1962–2003 ) and taught the theory of trade at the newly opened university , now warsaw university of economics . it was while at the university that craczkow discovered the statistical technique known as financial statistics . in particular , he discovered the statistical transformation of entries on a database into unique terms . craczkow is often considered the inventor of this technique , a name used by some in his time to describe his method . his book about financial statistics became a bestseller , and is considered a classic .


== career ==
as stokolsky and craczkow advanced their economic research , craczkow 's theories became less and less influential . the ukrainian communist government instituted liberalization in the polish economy . economists without a strong political agenda started to favor fiscal discipline and external trade policy that focused on structural factors like income distribution . it is also believed that , by the early 1950s , the economic changes brought about by the rise of communism were a great wakeup call for stokolsky . stokolsky believed that the strong social policies of the soviet union had reduced the share of the national income going to wages and salaries by over 50 % . craczkow realized that new financial instrumentation should be introduced to predict new economic and political events , such as military and economic war and the emergence of a communist-led ussr . in 1962 , craczkow and kalkar published their economics and the cycle ( baruch auerbach and ingemar craczkow , 1972 ) , a landmark work that turned the mathematical approach from the aid of stokolsky 's models into a treatise about political cycles .
in the early 1970s , craczkow participated in the warsaw summit to implement reforms to poland 's national currency . the paper recommended the introduction of the euro , a new and stable currency that was backed by the national currency of poland and was internationally recognized . craczkow was one of the main supporters of the introduction of the euro . however , a political breakdown in 1980 led to the removal of the agreement , and the monetary policy of the integration government was revised as of november 1984 . craczkow 's last published research was on the contributions that the soviet intervention in hungary had made in the soviet union 's reform of the currency policy .
craczkow became a member of the board of the institute of economic studies of the academy of sciences , in 1990 . in 1992 , the institute of economic sciences granted him the polish order of the danubian star for his contributions to polish economics .
craczkow died in 1986 .

== life ==
born in london , he studied mathematics at king 's college london . in 1893 he became a privatary in the geological survey and remained there for forty years . in 1911 he published an autobiography titled feet of mire , which traces the family history of the canton of rennes in the western alps . he had three children : john charles ( 1897–1978 ) , maurice ( 1902–1981 ) and melanie ( 1901–1955 ) .

== scientific work ==
kirkat described a number of of rocks , in particular lignite and matilde-siltstones ( kirkatites ) , and one particularly interesting fissure geology ( kirkatonsstolite ) . the name `` kirkat `` comes from kirkat 's well , a coal mine near weybridge in perthshire , which he investigated after he was elected a fellow of the society . he developed an `` assay technique `` for determining depth-water ratios in rock , in which he used thin-layer pleodic rocks . the technique was extended to many other rocks , particularly mineral inclusion rates , which were early predecessors of the tomography technique . he also developed new types of gneiss in the isotope determination , called `` kirkat crystals `` ( [ kirkat ] ) .
kirkat ’ s work on clay and associated fossils was extensive , and there are at least twelve papers and a large number of publications with him on geology ( see bibliography ) , all of which provide extensive information on the formation and structure of clay . the subject was deeply enlivened by kirkat 's encyclopedic knowledge of clay . a book of kirkat papers edited by his friend dorothy lyons , former student , the cadbury solution , was published in 1966 , two years after his death , as a companion to cadbury 's new cadbury cookery .

yvonne olen ( may 6 , 1886 in paris - december 11 , 1981 in bremen ) was an american neurologist , best known for introducing the concept of temporal lobe epilepsy.in addition to her work as a medical doctor , she was a member of the faculty of the university of bremen , in which her students included french neurologist eugène merrier . she died of liver cancer in bremen in 1981 , aged 82 .


== early years ==
yvonne olen was born in paris to a wealthy jewish family in 1887 . she was educated in france , germany , and switzerland and obtained a ph.d. from columbia university in 1932 . later in life , she had a conflict with her husband , who was a neurologist . he argued with her about her expertise and her romantic life . olen lost control of herself and began having epileptic seizures.olen 's parents did not have a particularly active jewish lifestyle . her father was an industrialist , but was a controversial figure ; both he and his wife suffered a succession of illnesses that put their children 's lives in danger . because of her father 's financial conflicts , his physicians were hired mainly to provide health insurance for his children.initially , olen was much better qualified than her husband . she had an outsize interest in learning , going so far as to write a textbook for her daughters in neurology . as a teenager , she gave an award at the marie curie festival at paris , during the world war i , to the daughter of general alfred von stockhausen . it was referred to as the `` honorary medal `` and was `` paid by the whole department of neurology `` .


== career ==
after leaving the university of paris in 1934 , she worked as an assistant to professor alfred huguenin in the university of bremen . by the time she was appointed as a full professor in 1949 , she had trained an additional 25 neurologists and had more than 300 students . at the university , she also published 10 books and several articles . olen joined the faculty of the university of bremen in 1953 . she remained there until she retired in 1980 .


== legacy ==
when her results were published in 1959 in the journal of the royal neurological institute in england , olen 's work was hailed as the first evidence for the existence of a temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome . however , even at this time , the prevailing notion was that ankylosing spondylitis ( a common form of neurology ) was the underlying cause of epileptic seizures . olen was one of the first scientists to refer the causes of the cause , which were made public after years of intensive editing . her work is still used to this day as a reference for researchers studying the etiology of temporal lobe epilepsy . in the last four decades , research has uncovered a wealth of scientific evidence that implicates prolonged periods of sleep deprivation in causing epileptic seizures.in 1976 , british neurologist and orthopedic surgeon and political activist james millar told of an encounter he had with olen on a saturday afternoon in 1954 : `` she was a great friend . she was even more brilliant at recovering from her epileptic episodes . i 'd be in jail if i knew how to deal with her . `` the american journal of medicine has listed olen among the leading 25 people to have been instrumental in the development of the testicular hypertrophy syndrome .

guldi , together with a.g. nabyshevsky and v.i . chernyshevsky , together with other experts from the moscow economic institute , developed statistical methods and methods of calculating the rates of interest and the interest component of the price .


== theories and demonstrations ==
during world war ii , guldi demonstrated the statistical method of computing the rate of interest in collaboration with v.i . chernyshevsky . a model of russian economy was developed for accounting purposes which relied on statistical methods .
in an analysis of the first period of the bank of russia gold reserves ( 1949–1956 ) , guldi made the following observations . according to the average of a number of economists , by the beginning of 1955 the gold reserves were 2,498,000 lire and the rate of interest was 5.22 percent . guldi concluded that :

in the first half of 1955 , at the present rate of interest , russia will hold approximately 70 percent of the world reserves.in february 1956 , during a visit to the moscow academy of economics , guldi developed the theory of storage of funds in the central bank of the ussr . for this purpose he was the first to measure the relative rigidity of the `` money reserve `` of the central bank , which is simply the fractional reserve of the reserves of the other bank .


== taxation ==
in one of the lectures , which was published by the central committee of the ussr academy of sciences in 1988 , he and a young economist mikhail gorney ( in 1928–29 when gorney was the author of the `` neo-marxism `` literature of the russian academy of sciences ) elaborated and demonstrated the information economy , which had become the leading force of social development in the ussr . the concept of money `` storage `` and the concept of goods-changers ( i.e . goods that result from taking a monetary value and keeping it as a unit of account ) were introduced by him . they were combined in a new system of prices for goods and services .
guldi distinguished four basic principles of practical theory :

price has its own value
prices have an inherent non-fractional basis
the free market maintains the system of prices in its institutions ( means of exchange , barter etc . )
the constant supply of prices leads to a stationary equilibrium of prices
prices are commonly calculable by an integrated flow-rate equation
prices follow the same sequence ( supply , demand , part and parcel )
the sale of a commodity does not change its value but only leads to its substitution in another commodity.in addition to this , guldi introduced the concept of the internet of things ( then still in the testing stage ) which was much important to many people during the period of the cyberworld .

= alexander anthony neale =
alexander anthony neale frs frse ( february 19 , 1878 – november 21 , 1949 ) was a scottish physicist .
he received a bsc in 1897 at oxford university , and a phd in 1899 from the university of edinburgh . he was director of the royal laboratory for theoretical and applied mathematics ( 1912–1915 ) from 1912 until his retirement in 1934 . from 1922 until his retirement he was the chair of university college of edinburgh 's mathematical sciences department . from 1923 until his retirement in 1944 he was professor of applied mathematics at university college london.the space age brought renewed interest in mathematical physics from the 1920s to the 1960s . a critical understanding of the theory of deflections , which had been in use for nearly two centuries , was being developed by other scholars in the fields of quantum mechanics and relativity , creating difficulties for the ‘ old ’ school . neale had a key role in the development of the ‘ newer ’ ‘ r ’ technique ( in the physics of vacuum tubes , vacuum diffusion and of physical objects ) , the beginnings of a theoretical and experimental technique which is still in use.neale 's work in the experimental study of refractive index and absorption of light ( often referred to as the use of light as a radar ) has led to several observations on refractive index and its sensitivity to scattering . one such was published in 1932 by neale . he investigated the response of scattered light to refractive index , while using photoelectron spectroscopy .


== early life ==
alexander neale was born on february 19 , 1878 , in cork , ireland . he graduated from the queen 's university of belfast in 1908 . neale entered the university of cambridge as a graduate student in 1899 . he was not a member of the cambridge mathematical society at this time , and had no formal mathematical training . he worked initially on topology , where he had just received a ph.d. under the supervision of the eminent george hamilton . later on , he was engaged in the foundations of applied mathematics in particular the mathematical analysis of problem theoretic properties of systems of continuous systems . he also worked on the theory of elastic light , using first-order logic to describe what is called the reflection of light through dense material such as silica into thin films . the use of what is now known as the ceylon diagram in paper-folding sawmills and other physical systems to solve practical problems became very popular and established his position as a pioneer of physics and optics . he received a second ph.d. from the university of edinburgh in 1911 .


== career ==
in 1920 , he became a fellow of the royal society and was a corresponding member of the royal society of edinburgh from 1916 until his retirement in 1934 . in 1933 , he was elected as a fellow of the royal astronomical society . he was appointed professor of applied mathematics at the university of edinburgh in 1935 and professor of experimental physics at university college london in 1938.in 1936 , he made a radical change in mathematical physics which is still used to this day : he applied first-order logic and mathematics to space to describe the structure of a process , called atomistic interpretation . he introduced the `` nebel axiom `` ( as he called it ) in this work.in 1937 he became professor of applied mathematics at the university of london , and in 1948 professor of physics at the university of glasgow , where he remained until his retirement in 1949 . his work was closely allied with charles evarts , who in 1911 received a phd under the supervision of alexander neale . evarts was the founder of the field of condensed matter physics , and gave neale a great deal of help in both developing and running the glasgow group .

= otto wilhelm friedrich von dehnius =
otto wilhelm friedrich von dehnius ( german : [ ˈoʁtər frɨntʁv jɪnju ] ; 28 june 1745 – 25 june 1805 ) was a german astronomer and astronomer , born at egersdorff in 1813 . he was a lieutenant-colonel in the prussian empire . dehnius wrote a prophetic ascent and vindication , but little else .
dehnius is remembered for proposing his quadrant law ( vindication ) to one of his superiors , johann abraham dirick . this proposal was based on the axiom of partial differential equations . dehnius , a prussian politician , was elected to the prussian parliament , and the law became part of german astronomy .
the law also explained the rotation and eccentricity of the earth , and as a later discovery disproved some of the famous comet theories of that time .
dehnius had originally developed his idea in a mathematics paper , but the new law found its way into more serious scientific discussion in 1803 . the proof of the law became a widely publicized phenomenon . many geocachers maintained high standards , and in the 1820s dehnius was given medals of honour by other states .


== life ==

otto wilhelm friedrich von dehnius was born in egersdorff , prussia ( now königsberg ) on 28 june 1745 , the second son of johann abraham dehnius ( 1705–1781 ) and his wife susanne . his father worked at an ophthalmological clinic , and died when otto was twelve.the family lived in dresden and vienna , where dehnius developed a keen interest in mathematics , natural philosophy and astronomy , and was elected to the vienna house of commons in 1766 . during his stay in vienna he met and befriended rudolf von kirchhoff , isaac newton , julius evola , and other prominent philosophers . his name was eventually used by william herschel to make his comets of 1814 and 1815 .
dehnius received his b.s . ( 1769 ) in mathematics from university of vienna and his m.d . ( 1774 ) from the university of leipzig , where he was an assistant physician . in 1782 he was elected to the house of commons in prussia , which replaced the lower chamber of the same name , which was largely controlled by prussian nobility . he then took up residence in leipzig . in leipzig he conducted astronomical studies under his mentor kirchhoff ( 1752–1829 ) , and in 1787 , published his first book , a work in progress in philosophy and astronomy , with an extra chapter on astronomy as applied to metallurgy . von dehnius soon became de facto inspector of the astronomy at leipzig , and the city 's annexation to the prussian republic , allowing him to take full and direct control of astronomy there , was the end of his political career . he retired from politics and returned to leipzig .
dehnius lived at leipzig for the rest of his life , and his duties at leipzig enabled him to learn what is known today as stellararithmetic , the study of eclipses and coronal transformations , beginning in the mid-1780s . during this time he also worked on the `` leipzig syndrome `` . this term is sometimes used to describe the night sky 's oblateness . he also did calculations using equations , such as the fourier series , which provided illumination in his book ästhetische begriff des natur in der physik .

dehnius published all of his works in leipzig , berlin , strasbourg , and bonn . he died in bonn , at the age of 69 , during the second voyage of the world 's first torpedo boat , the fritz plan , on 25 june 1805 . a crater on the moon is named after him .

= franz paulowitz =
franz paulowitz ( or paulov ; russian : петр васи́нович нау́вов ; 19 august 1890 – 19 july 1971 ) was a german philosopher who was active in germany during world war ii . in 1935 , he became professor of philosophy at the university of rostock . in 1951 , he was awarded the prix e du duc d'urville . he was best known for his work on ethics and the system of morals .


== early life ==
paulowitz was born on 19 august 1890 in poznań , poland . he studied philosophy and philology in the freiberg polytechnic in braunschweig and was later ordained as a priest . he then studied logic at the universities of berlin , strasbourg , and zürich . he became a civil servant at the ministry of justice in strasbourg where he worked as a lawyer until 1919 , when he took a position at the deutsche physikalische gesellschaft in leipzig as a lecturer in theoretical physics and on quantum physics . he became director of the physikalisch-synthesische akademie der wissenschaften ( physical society of science ) in leipzig in 1919 , taking the title of director on 29 july 1923 , and serving until his retirement in 1959 .


== ideology ==
at this time , paulowitz was primarily concerned with the problems of kant and post-kantianism , which were controversial . kant was regarded by some as the founder of the modern philosophy of knowledge , however paulowitz questioned the implications of his ideas . karl barth explicitly criticized kant 's position in regard to truth , arguing in his critical foundations of metaphysics ( 1871 ) that the essential difference between the transcendent and the specific is that the former concerns absolute truth , while the latter concerns the lack of experience and subjectivity in common conceptions of objects . paulowitz , on the other hand , stated that the latter thought everything capable of being known is accessible to experience in the intellect and the will .


== paulov and truth ==
paulowitz was a proponent of paul cohen 's theory of knowledge . this idea arose from his initial writing on mathematics and ontology , in which he argued that the objects of mathematical theory correspond to the generalizations of the theories of mind . he also believed the logical structure of thought , of which logic is a part , to be able to contain truth.in his critique of pure reason ( 1898 ) paulowitz formulated a `` deontological critique of reason `` that holds that reason is really a philosophical exercise and that it has the intention to make the world better than it is . this philosophical approach to the investigation of truth , in which he explicitly draws on carnap 's ontological argument , develops his philosophy of ethics and moral theory , and in which he presents his own position in the developing and broad conception of moral realism .

= louis arnauld de candagno =
louis arnauld de candagno ( french : [ ɑlāʁn bə . ] ; 30 may 1742 – 14 march 1809 ) was a belgian geographer .


== biography ==
louis arnauld de candagno was born in saint-françois-de-aube , in the duchy of deventer and graduated in 1777 . he was physician to the duke of buccleuch , the general of the hussite army , who was an opponent of the huguenots and the napoleonic wars . during the french revolution he was interned in a storehouse in benoît-sur-seine , but was permitted to return to brussels in 1789 .
he came to brussels in 1796 , in the employ of his father-in-law and charles-joseph giraud ( 1711–1786 ) . he was admitted as an assistant geographer in 1798 . in the same year , he travelled to russia as deputy state geographer in the ottoman empire .
in 1803 he was named geographer to the romanov government , which had assembled in kiev in 1801 .
candagno published a work of monumental and historical character ( histoire géographique des moscoms des cordeliers de jean-baptiste louis de candagno ) , which had eluded translation at that time , until francoise julien bretter 's edition was published in 1911 . his contributions to the geography of france ( 1794–1805 ) and britain ( 1805–1811 ) had opened up a new field in geographical research , the study of the global distribution of nations and their people . in this connection he was the first to find that the british isles stood on the `` southern end `` of the distribution range of the british isles .
the geographer jean-pierre loïc beaucaigne called him `` the father of geographers `` , and thus the first of them . on the other hand , french academic historians pierre-sébastien savard , drouet bursard , franck dufour , florian canton , and a small number of french officers considered him a great amateur who should be taken for a moron when elected to the geographical society of london .
candagno appears to have wished to go to switzerland to work for some partner or publisher of his large and important histoire géographique . in 1802 he took his post in palermo and at the time of his death in london in 1809 , by then in great financial difficulties , he was still holding the post as a professor of geography at the royal college of physicians in london .

schwaepper 's first published paper dealt with the effects of emethetic drugs such as morphine , but his concentration and transparency is less known . he discovered first that the synthesis of the drugs under physiological conditions of respiration became possible , producing bright red urine ( schimmelhundenzymbol ) after one hour of cessation , and after twenty hours `` the presence of morphine in the urine makes us glad and even giddy `` ( schimmelhundenzymbol ) . schwaepper also gave some empirical evidence that in humans and animals the nervous system appears to be on a level with that of a living organism .

nicolas antoine cousin ( 1786 , nice – 1854 , geneva ) was a french artist and zoologist . he is best known for the more general representation of plants in his work with wéber and grosskreutz , and for his contribution to the unified definition of taxonomy , namely , that with specific taxonomic groups we are talking about an organism 's group-level structure .


== life and career ==
cousin was born on 17 april 1786 in nice , france to catholic parents jean-antoine and marie-vicienne cousin . he studied science in paris .

== theological references ==

coucin was also an avid naturalist and proponent of organic agriculture . he led several trips to the brittany region in order to study for the biblical books of chronicles and proverbs . this activity , and his long association with the sieur de castelnau 's re-development of the natural history collections of the gouvernement de la cours dunkerque ( cour de rome ) , helped bring napoleon bonaparte into the field , and enabled him to collect some of the native plants which he had never seen before in the french colonies .


== taxonomy ==
his work has been criticized as `` unbiblical `` due to the presence of characters whose antiquity is scientifically unknown .
for example , the words brevirostris , breviary , means `` the tree that grows on a green vine , `` and is indicative of a plant not specifically described as a citrus . another example is `` perspic-fructification : to produce a plant so its roots or shoots are firmly rooted , without which it would not thrive `` . plants grow well in temperatures of +40 °c .

bettina louise bockstetter ( august 29 , 1915 – september 7 , 1999 ) was an american microevolutionist , immunologist and culturist who wrote about bacterial hybridization and bacterial toxin theory in the 1970s . she is best known as the co-author , with stewart stevens , of the classic book on hybridization known as the science of hybridization : its origin and meaning , first ed. , with stewart stevens , ed . in 1971 , she was awarded the national medal of science . she received the kennedy research fellow medal from the united states department of agriculture .


== biography ==
bettina louise bockstetter was born in chicago , illinois in 1915 . her mother was a classical pianist with an innovative stage presence .
she completed a mathematics degree from ohio wesleyan university in 1941 and earned her master 's degree in 1941 . in 1943 she married timothy bessell , a computer scientist , who helped her work as a computer programmer in mathematics . she then taught for a year as a professor at the university of texas at austin . her research interests focused on the interaction of bacteria and dna in the development of microbial cell lines . in 1955 she moved to the united states to live with her mother . as a result of her scholarly work in genetics and microevolution , she was awarded a ph.d. from the university of chicago in 1967 .
after her doctorate she served for a time in the pacific ocean under special intelligence assessments . she then began working for the pentagon on behalf of the united states government as a scientific consultant on nuclear weapons research . she also was a paid consultant for the defense computer company kernware , where she helped construct the “ budweiser commercial ” beer system and also worked on developing a virus scanner called the codelink that could speed up analysis of smallpox viruses .


== career ==
after the war , bockstetter returned to texas to work for the texas department of state health services ( now texas state hospital ) , where she began studying bacteriophage viruses . she became a visiting scholar at mit and received her ph.d. in biology in 1976 from the university of chicago . she and steven stevens continued their research of bacterial hybridization . she published the science of hybridization with stewart stevens in 1971 . her husband died in 1984 . bettina bockstetter died in 1999 at her home in amarillo , texas .
the topic of her pioneering work was the origin and significance of bacterial diversity , which in bockstetter ’ s study was the leading theme of all her work . the new research , with evolutionary biologists kenneth miller and john o'donoghue , explored the role of gene dynamics in the self-organization of genetic materials in bacterial multicellular organisms . bockstetter presented her own theory of the origin of the complex of bacterial species in 1988 . in the study 's final chapter , entitled “ the evidence for water , ” she concluded that many microbial communities are involved in the production of certain key nutrients and the passage of viruses .
her best-known work was the nature of life with stewart stevens , who she had worked with since 1963 . according to bettina bockstetter , her major role in bringing her husband stewart into the subject of hybridization was to educate him about biology , specifically , the relationship between microbiomes and pathogenesis . they argued for the establishment of a clinical laboratory in europe for microbiology and genetics researchers , and were awarded a fellowship .


== research ==
in 1971 , bockstetter co-authored the science of hybridization with stewart stevens with stewart stevens , ed . in 1971 she received the national medal of science . she and stevens continued to study hybridization in the late 1960s , which brought them together again in a coauthored book the history of hybridization ( 1974 ) . she published later that year , the first instalment in the series of nine that served as two eponymous books . the third and final book in the series of three , simpler and sparser species , was published in 1978 . it ran to twenty volumes , edited by barbara allen , stephen s. bernard , and barbara callender.she wrote a personal testimony on the origin of the fusarium .

= jacques creer =
jacques creer ( 24 november 1845 – 26 april 1912 ) was a french entomologist who specialised in insects , especially the mosquitoes .


== biography ==
jacques creer was born at carcassonne . he began his career as an assistant and later a chief gardener , and devoted himself mainly to the study of mosquitoes . as a result , in 1875 he wrote an article on subspecies of ant , liolaemus crescorum , of south africa . in 1886 he became a junior entomologist . in 1891 he published the results of an investigation , undertaken in conjunction with his colleague , dr. van schryver , and in the course of which the three of them collected in the hausend – sur-vincent region of southern africa an abundance of mosquitoes . the articles , collected during the years 1894–1895 , became a regular appendix in the entomologist , and were occasionally reproduced in local journals.upon his return to france in 1897 he started work on an introduction to zoology which appeared in four parts in 1902 , and another in 1905 . in 1905 he was the author of a lengthy article on liolaemus ( liolaemus crescorum ) , which appeared in the gazette de la société d'etude géographique , and in 1908 in the bulletin des minéralogie , ou , mémoire sur la société géologique des animaux , and in 1910 , together with other authors , the volume on liolaemus ( liolaemus crescorum ) which appeared in the journal des sciences naturelles , and also in the bulletin d'entomologie universelle .


== research ==

creer developed a theory of the inheritance of character which at one time was accepted by the majority of researchers in entomology . this idea was that a person becomes chaste ( mère chaleur ) when he or she is exposed to the intensity of the mosquito-borne disease , regardless of any hormonal or other factors affecting the body . however , in 1910 , creer and his colleagues presented , at the 60th international congress on parasites , the case of a hunter , surnamed creer ( norwegian : cresco ) , who was reported to have had a lifelong relationship with a parrot female , romée jean melchior , after her death from cholera . they ruled out that jealousy was at work and concluded that creer was simply being `` hard on `` her . this later became known as the creer case . however , the veracity of this case was questioned , and , in fact , the material that resulted from this investigation did not support creer 's hypothesis of the origin of character ; instead , it pointed to local personal relationships to be the factor in character formation.of note , creer also conducted an investigation which involved observations in a part of north africa , in partnership with eugène royer , and which led to the establishment of two families ( malipenes ) in asia and south america .
his most important scientific contribution was the development of a theory of the transmission of tsetse flies to other insects , which eventually led to the research of tropical diseases , particularly dengue fever.creer was an apothecary .
