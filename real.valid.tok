= alfred goldscheider =
johannes karl eugen alfred goldscheider ( 4 august 1858 – 10 april 1935 ) was a german neurologist born into a jewish family in sommerfeld ( today lubsko , poland ) .
he studied medicine at friedrich-wilhelm medical-surgical institute in berlin ( promotion 1881 ) , and subsequently spent the next seven years as a military physician . during this period of time , he also served as an assistant to physiologist emil du bois-reymond ( 1818-1896 ) . he later became a professor at the university of berlin .
in berlin , he served as directing physician at the krankenhaus moabit ( from 1894 ) and at the virchow-krankenhaus ( from 1906 ) . in 1910 he succeeded hermann senator at the polyclinic .


== research ==
goldscheider is best known for his work with the somatosensory system , in particular , research of the body 's thermoreceptors in regards to localized `` coolness `` and `` warmness `` spots . he also performed research of localized tactile skin sensitivity that included tests involving `` pain `` and `` tickle `` sensations . the eponymous terms ; `` goldscheider 's test `` and `` goldscheider 's percussion `` are derived from his research . during this time period ( the early 1880s ) , swedish physician magnus blix ( 1849-1904 ) of the university of uppsala was performing similar tests , independent of goldscheider .
in the late 1890s , with neurologist edward flatau ( 1868-1932 ) , goldscheider performed studies on the structure of nerve cells and their changes under different stimuli . also , he is credited with describing the skin disorder , epidermolysis bullosa , a condition sometimes called `` goldscheider 's disease `` .goldscheider died in berlin .

isaac backus ( january 9 , 1724 – november 20 , 1806 ) was a leading baptist preacher during the era of the american revolution who campaigned against state-established churches in new england .
born in the village of yantic , now part of the town of norwich , connecticut , backus was influenced by the great awakening and the works of jonathan edwards and george whitefield . he was converted in 1741 . for five years , he was a member of a separatist congregationalist church . in 1746 , he became a preacher . he was ordained in 1748 . backus became a baptist in 1751 when he became pastor of the middleborough baptist church in middleborough , massachusetts .
in 1764 , isaac backus joined john brown , nicholas brown , william ellery , stephen hopkins , james manning , ezra stiles , samuel stillman , morgan edwards and several others as an original fellow or trustee for the chartering of the college in the english colony of rhode island and providence plantations ( the original name for brown university ) , the first baptist school of higher learning .


== american revolutionary period ==
considered a leading orator of the `` pulpit of the american revolution . `` backus published a sermon in 1773 that articulated his desire for religious liberty and a separation of church and state called an appeal to the public for religious liberty , against the oppressions of the present day . in that book , backus stated : `` now who can hear christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? `` in 1778 , he authored a historically important work entitled government and liberty described and ecclesiastical tyranny exposed of which a copy is held by the john carter brown library at brown .


== during the ratification debate ==
backus served as a delegate from middleborough to the massachusetts ratifying convention , which ratified the united states constitution in 1788 . in a speech during the convention , backus praised the constitution for its prohibition of religious tests for federal office holders : many appear to be much concerned about it [ prohibition of religious tests ] , but nothing is more evident , both in reason , and in the holy scriptures , than that religion is ever a matter between god and individuals ; and therefore no man or men can impose any religious test , without invading the essential prerogatives of our lord jesus christ . ministers first assumed this power under the christian name ; and then constantine approved of the practice , when he adopted the profession of christianity , as an engine of state policy . and let the history of all nations be searched , from that day to this , and it will appear that the imposing of religious tests hath been the greatest engine of tyranny in the world.in the same speech backus also praised the constitution for giving the federal government the power to tax and eventually ( after twenty years ) regulate or abolish the slave trade .
he voted in favor of ratification .

= george e. coghill =
george ellett coghill ( march 17 , 1872 – july 23 , 1941 ) was an american philosopher anatomist best known for his work relating neuromuscular system development with movement patterns in embryos . coghill performed much of the empirical work supporting the theory that development of movement is not simply the accumulation of individualized reflexes , but rather a result of the differentiation of generalized total movement .


== early years ==
born in beaucoup , illinois , as the fifth child of john waller and elisabeth tucker coghill , george started college at shurtleff college in alton , illinois . he later transferred to and graduated from brown university with a bachelors and two doctorate degrees . in 1899 , coghill began teaching biology at the university of new mexico . in new mexico , he met muriel anderson and the two would wed in 1900 , with the marriage producing five children.in 1902 , he was hired as a professor at pacific university in forest grove , oregon . here , he acted as the corresponding secretary for the oregon state academy of sciences . ] ] he remained there until 1906 when he moved further down the willamette valley and began teaching at willamette university in salem . he would later teach at denison university and at the university of kansas .


== scientific career ==
coghill extensively worked with ambystomas , a species of salamanders , to demonstrate the relationship between the development of behavior and the development of the nervous system . when observing the development of movement ambystomas , coghill noticed that the first observable movements were in the trunk of the ambystoma embryos . these movements developed over time from unspecific , sometimes spontaneous , myogenic motions to unilateral flexures to concerted motions that resembled swimming . coghill hypothesized that this movement was the precursor to later feeding behavior or walking behavior.in coghill 's studies , ambystoma limb movement was first observed as a result of total body movement and was only later observed as a result of individualized movement that resembled locomotion ; thus , the movement observed in a fully developed ambystoma embryo is the result of first generalized movement , then the differentiated movement of specific limbs within the totality of organized movement . coghill 's theory for how the individualization of limb movement emerged from general patterns mirrored that of sherrington 's law of reciprocal innervation ; the movement of a specific limb involves the inhibition of activity of the rest of the body and , thus , the movement of a particular limb requires excitation of one part of the body and inhibition of the rest of the body . this behavior was only descriptive towards species-specific ambystoma somatic movement . coghill extensively detailed his work on the development and integration of the central and peripheral system ( both afferent and efferent pathways ) in a series of papers collectively called `` correlated anatomical and physiological studies of the growth of the nervous system of amphibia . ``
in addition to his own scientific studies , coghill was also a managing editor for the journal of comparative neurology between the years of 1927 and 1933 .


== death ==
at the time of his death , coghill was studying how anatomical changes contributed to the development of individual fin movements in killifish and toadfish and limb movements in reptiles and opossums . though he was n't able to finish the experiments with these animals , coghill was anticipating that the differential fin and limb movement developed in a similar fashion as the ambystoma . at the time of his death , coghill was also working on a manuscript entitled `` principles of development in psycho-organismal behavior . `` george e. coghill died in gainesville , florida on july 23 , 1941 .


== awards ==
he received the award of the daniel giraud elliot medal in 1930 , from the national academy of sciences , for his work entitled correlated anatomical and physiological studies of the growth of the nervous system of amphibia which he wrote during his time at the university of kansas . he was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1935 .

= josef hlouch =
josef hlouch ( 26 march 1902 - 10 june 1972 ) was a czech roman catholic prelate and theologian who served as the bishop of budweis from 1947 until his death . hlouch first served as a parish priest and professor in olomouc and other places before he was appointed to the episcopate following a standoff between ecclesial authorities and the nazis as to whom would assume the budweis episcopal see . he was installed in his new diocese at a time when communist authorities solidified their control over the then-czechoslovakia which prompted hlouch and other ecclesial leaders such as josef beran to speak out against communist repression . hlouch was placed under house arrest and later exiled from his diocese but the prague spring allowed for him to return in 1968.the late bishop became known for his holiness and for his leadership of his old diocese and in 2015 the czech episcopal conference lodged a formal request to rome to open the beatification process . the process opened on 7 november 2017 and he became titled as a servant of god .


== life ==
josef hlouch was born in lipník in the třebíč district on 26 march 1902 to jakub hlouch and marie hlouchová .
in 1935 he obtained his doctorate in theological studies in olomouc after having obtained his habilitation in 1934 . he received his ordination to the priesthood in mid-1926 in olomouc from archbishop leopold prečan . from 1945 until his episcopal appointment he served as a professor to seminarians after having served as a pastor since 1939 just before world war ii began . in september 1928 he began serving as the parish administrator for the hodolana parish in olomouc .
hlouch was later appointed as a bishop and received his episcopal consecration from saverio ritter in olomouc with josef beran and stanislav zela serving as the co-consecrators .
his solemn enthronement in his episcopal see came as a relief to the faithful since the see had been vacant since 1940 . the nazis had opposed a particular prelate nominated for the position leading to pope pius xii leaving the see vacant ; the nazis defeat in 1945 allowed for hlouch to be appointed as a bishop . his constant criticisms and opposition to the communist regime in the then-czechoslovakia prompted his exile from the diocese . this was exacerbated when the authorities began monitoring all his activities after a 19 june 1949 sermon where he criticized the nation 's direction under the regime . he returned to his diocese on 9 june 1968 on the occasion of the prague spring . hlouch had even been placed under house arrest in 1950 and in 1952 was arrested and then exiled from his diocese without a court trial . he left for several cities during this time first in liberec and then in mladá vožice.in 1963 the facilitated negotiations between pope john xxiii and the czech socialist republic allowed for imprisoned bishops to be released . this prompted hlouch 's release in april 1963 .
in 1968 he sent a letter to miloslav vlk in which he asked the then-deacon to become his personal aide . this was much to vlk 's surprise who had hoped to go abroad for further studies . prior to vlk 's ordination he met with hlouch in the bishopric for breakfast one morning where he spoke to the prelate about his plans for his future studies . hlouch met with vlk again one morning in the bishopric for breakfast two weeks later in which the latter assented to the role . hlouch later ordained vlk as a priest on 23 june 1968 .
hlouch died on 10 june 1972 . his reputation for holiness had been noted in his life as well as for his gentle smile combined with his thoughtful nature . the communists did not allow for pope paul vi to name a successor which rendered the see vacant until pope john paul ii appointed miloslav vlk as hlouch 's successor .


== beatification process ==
from 2012 the late bishop 's friend and aide miloslav vlk - now a cardinal - said that a beatification process could be launched because the potential for a formal application to rome was something being evaluated . the czech episcopal conference in autumn 2015 made a formal application to the congregation for the causes of saints to launch the cause with the c.c.s . issuing the `` nihil obstat `` decree on 7 november 2017 in a move that titled hlouch as a servant of god.the diocesan process to collect documentation and witness testimonies is expected to be launched sometime in 2018 .

= lev pontryagin =
lev semyonovich pontryagin ( russian : лев семёнович понтрягин , also written pontriagin or pontrjagin ) ( 3 september 1908 – 3 may 1988 ) was a soviet mathematician . he was born in moscow and lost his eyesight due to a primus stove explosion when he was 14 . despite his blindness he was able to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century , partially with the help of his mother tatyana andreevna who read mathematical books and papers ( notably those of heinz hopf , j. h. c. whitehead , and hassler whitney ) to him . he made major discoveries in a number of fields of mathematics , including algebraic topology and differential topology .


== work ==
pontryagin worked on duality theory for homology while still a student . he went on to lay foundations for the abstract theory of the fourier transform , now called pontryagin duality . with rené thom , he is regarded as one of the co-founders of cobordism theory , and co-discoverers of the central idea of this theory , that framed cobordism and stable homotopy are equivalent . this led to the introduction around 1940 of a theory of certain characteristic classes , now called pontryagin classes , designed to vanish on a manifold that is a boundary . in 1942 he introduced the cohomology operations now called pontryagin squares . moreover , in operator theory there are specific instances of krein spaces called pontryagin spaces .
later in his career he worked in optimal control theory . his maximum principle is fundamental to the modern theory of optimization . he also introduced there the idea of a bang-bang principle , to describe situations where either the maximum 'steer ' should be applied to a system , or none.pontryagin authored several influential monographs as well as popular textbooks in mathematics .

pontryagin 's students include dmitri anosov , vladimir boltyansky , revaz gamkrelidze , evgeni mishchenko , mikhail postnikov , vladimir rokhlin , and mikhail zelikin .


== controversy and anti-semitism allegations ==
pontryagin was accused of anti-semitism on several occasions . for example , he attacked nathan jacobson for being a `` mediocre scientist `` representing the `` zionism movement `` , while both men were vice-presidents of the international mathematical union . he rejected charges of anti-semitism in an article published in science in 1979 , claiming that he struggled with zionism , which he considered a form of racism . when a prominent soviet jewish mathematician , grigory margulis , was selected by the imu to receive the fields medal at the upcoming 1978 icm , pontryagin , who was a member of the executive committee of the imu at the time , vigorously objected . although the imu stood by its decision to award margulis the fields medal , margulis was denied a soviet exit visa by the soviet authorities and was unable to attend the 1978 icm in person .
pontryagin also participated in a few notorious political campaigns in the soviet union , most notably , in the luzin affair .

kramer was born on september 28 , 1897 in zhashkiv near uman in the kiev governorate , russian empire ( modern day ukraine ) , the son of benjamin and yetta kramer . in 1905 , as a result of the anti-semitic pogroms under czar nicholas ii of russia , his family emigrated to philadelphia , where his father established a hebrew school . after graduating from south philadelphia high school , obtaining an academic diploma , kramer tried a variety of occupations , including teaching in his father 's school , becoming a writer and becoming a businessman .
concerning the time when he began to approach the age of thirty , still without a career , he later stated in his autobiography , in the world of sumer : `` finally it came to me that i might well go back to my beginnings and try to utilize the hebrew learning on which i had spent so much of my youth , and relate it in some way to an academic future `` .

he enrolled at dropsie college for hebrew and cognate learning in philadelphia , and became passionately interested in egyptology . he then transferred to the oriental studies department of the university of pennsylvania , working with the `` brilliant young ephraim avigdor speiser , who was to become one of the world 's leading figures in near eastern studies `` . speiser was trying to decipher cuneiform tablets of the late bronze age dating from about 1300 bc ; it was now that kramer began his lifelong work in understanding the cuneiform writing system .
kramer earned his ph.d. in 1929 , and was famous for assembling tablets recounting single stories that had become distributed among different institutions around the world . he retired from formal academic life in 1968 , but remained very active throughout his post-retirement years .
in his autobiography published in 1986 , he sums up his accomplishments : `` first , and most important , is the role i played in the recovery , restoration , and resurrection of sumerian literature , or at least of a representative cross section . . . through my efforts several thousand sumerian literary tablets and fragments have been made available to cuneiformists , a basic reservoir of unadulterated data that will endure for many decades to come . second , i endeavored . . . to make available reasonably reliable translations of many of these documents to the academic community , and especially to the anthropologist , historian , and humanist . third , i have helped to spread the name of sumer to the world at large , and to make people aware of the crucial role the sumerians played in the ascent of civilized man `` .kramer died of throat cancer at age 93 on november 26 , 1990 in philadelphia .

in 1929 , hawley returned to queen 's as professor and head of the department of mineralogy . his earliest papers in 1929 and 1930 , based on research on the generation of oil in rocks by shearing pressures , are classics in the field of petroleum geology . in 1948 , he established the school 's spectrographic lab . he held that position until the mineralogy and geology department were combined in 1950 . at that time he was made head of the newly created , geological sciences department . he held that position until 1962 . students familiar with mohs ’ hardness scale referred to him as `` number 11 `` because the mineral , hawleyite , was named after him .
he was a pioneer in the field of interpretative mineralogy ; much of his research was devoted to genetic associations of ore deposits and to investigation of conditions under which metallic minerals may be transported and deposited .
through both by field investigations and by laboratory researches , hawley made notable contributions to the mineralogy of such deposits as the nickel-copper ores of sudbury , the iron ores of the michipicoten district and steep rock lake , the gold ores of kirkland lake and northern quebec , the complex ores of the eastern townships , precambrian stratigraphy , and evidences of life in the archaean .
the royal society of canada said this about hawley ’ s scientific work ,

`` dr. hawley has brought to geology an incisive , scientific mind and an exceptional knowledge of the basic sciences of chemistry and physics . his work is notable for acute observation in the field and for interpretation of field phenomena on the basis of the fundamental laws of science . as a result , his contributions contain fresh and original ideas , many of which have opened up new channels of geological investigation . on the other hand , he has shown the fallacies of a number of geological hypotheses which can not be substantiated by established laws of chemistry and physics . ``
dr. hawley was a member of the national advisory committee on research in the geological sciences .
hawley retired in 1963 and died two years later .

sir ( ambrose ) thomas stanton ( 14 november 1875 – 25 january 1938 ) was a canadian surgeon , entomologist and health administrator who helped to identify the cause of beri-beri . he later became chief medical adviser to the british secretary of state for the colonies .
he was born in the village of kendal , durham county , ontario to storekeeper thomas stanton and educated at the local port hope high school on the north shore of lake ontario . after graduating from trinity medical college , toronto in 1899 , he worked as a house surgeon at the hospital for sick children and toronto general hospital before becoming surgeon on a liner in 1901 . in 1905 he moved to england to continue his medical studies at university college and the london hospital , earning a diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene ( dtm & h ) in 1906 . he joined the hospital for tropical diseases as a house surgeon , rising to registrar , and also taught at the london school of tropical medicine.in 1907 he left to work in malaya with henry fraser at the institute for medical research in kuala lumpur on a project to investigate the cause of beri-beri , a debilitating disease which afflicted the local people . he
lived for nearly a year in a remote part of the jungle where a new road was being constructed . there he arranged that one group of labourers were supplied with a diet of polished rice and another group with unpolished rice . when the group fed on polished rice developed beri-beri they were able to deduce that beri-beri was a disease of the metabolism caused by a dietary deficiency related to the rice polishing process . the unpolished rice was subsequently found to contain trace amounts of alcohol-soluble substances , later to be known as vitamins , and in particular of vitamin b1.he was also a keen entomologist and did important work on the identification and classification of mosquitos and mosquito larvae . when an outbreak of a new disease in the malayan rubber plantations occurred in 1917 he was able to identify the cause as an outbreak of melioidosis , caused by a bacterial contamination of groundwater .
in 1920 he was put in charge of the institute and in 1926 made the first chief medical officer at the colonial office , where he advised the secretary of state for the colonies on medical matters affecting some fifty crown colonies and protectorates.he served on several committees such as the colonial advisory medical committee and the managing committee of the bureau of hygiene and tropical diseases . he was also a board member of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine and a member of the councils of the royal society of tropical medicine and hygiene and the british empire leprosy relief association . he died in 1938 . he had married in 1930 dr. elizabeth o'flynn .

== biography ==
son of john tradescant the elder , he was born in meopham , kent , and educated at the king 's school , canterbury . like his father , who collected specimens and rarities on his many trips abroad , he undertook collecting expeditions to virginia between 1628 and 1637 ( and possibly two more trips by 1662 , though potter and other authors doubt this ) . among the seeds he brought back , to introduce to english gardens were great american trees , including magnolias , bald cypress and tulip tree , and garden plants such as phlox and asters .
john tradescant the younger added his american acquisitions to the family 's cabinet of curiosities , known as the ark . these included the ceremonial cloak of chief powhatan , an important native american relic . south lambeth road in vauxhall was one of the boundaries of the tradescant estate , where the collection was kept and tradescant road was laid out after the estate was built on in the late 1800s and named after the family .
when his father died , he succeeded as head gardener to charles i and henrietta maria of france , making gardens at the queen 's house , greenwich , designed by inigo jones , from 1638 to 1642 , when the queen fled the civil war . he published the contents of his father 's celebrated collection as musaeum tradescantianum—books , coins , weapons , costumes , taxidermy , and other curiosities—dedicating the first edition to the royal college of physicians ( with whom he was negotiating for the transfer of his botanic garden ) , and the second edition to the recently restored charles ii . tradescant bequeathed his library and museum to ( or some say it was swindled from him by ) elias ashmole ( 1617–1692 ) , whose name it bears as the core of the ashmolean museum in oxford where the tradescant collections remain largely intact .
he was buried beside his father in the churchyard of st-mary-at-lambeth which is now established as the garden museum .
he is the subject of the novel virgin earth by philippa gregory , sequel to earthly joys about his father .

= saul rosenzweig =
saul rosenzweig ( 1907–2004 ) was an american psychologist and therapist who studied subjects such as repression , psychotherapy , and aggression . rosenzweig , who , with a co-author , has been credited with being the first to attempt to `` elicit repression `` in a laboratory setting , became well known after publishing a paper discussing `` common factors `` underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy .


== biography ==
rosenzweig , a friend and classmate of b.f. skinner , earned his doctorate from harvard college in 1932 . he worked at worcester state hospital and clark university before becoming the chief psychologist at the western state psychiatric institute.rosenzweig taught at washington university in st. louis from 1948 until he retired in 1975 .
he died on august 9 , 2004 , at the age of 97 .


== work ==
in the 1930s , rosenzweig studied repression . with g. mason , rosenzweig criticized h. meltzer 's survey of studies of repression in an article published in the british journal of psychology . rosenzweig and mason argued that the studies reviewed by meltzer worked with sensory stimuli unrelated to the theory of repression , and `` failed to develop under laboratory control the experiences which are subsequently to be tested for recall . `` donald w. mackinnon and william f. dukes credit rosenzweig and mason with being `` the first to make an explicit attempt to elicit repression under conditions of laboratory control and observation . `` sigmund freud was sent reprints of rosenzweig 's attempts to study repression , but replied to rosenzweig that while he had examined his `` experimental studies for the verification of the psychoanalytic assertions with interest `` he could not `` put much value on these confirmations because the wealth of reliable observations on which these assertions rest make them independent of experimental verification . `` rosenzweig became well known after publishing a paper discussing `` common factors `` underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy . he argued that all models of therapy could be equally successful , due to competent therapists sharing common factors that aided their patients . his premise became known as the dodo bird verdict or dodo bird hypothesis — a reference to lewis carroll 's alice 's adventures in wonderland ( 1865 ) , in which a dodo bird declares at the end of a race designed to dry everyone off : `` everybody has won and all must have prizes . `` rosenzweig 's study of aggression led to the development of the rosenzweig picture-frustration study , a test of latent hostility . the rosenzweig picture frustration study is usually considered a semi-projective technique and involves an examinee responding verbally to a semi-ambiguous picture scenario . each of the three forms ( child , adolescent , and adult ) consists of 24 comic strip pictures that portray a situation that might induce frustration . the overall purpose of the study is to assess how the examinee responds to frustration and frustrating situations . the test assumes that the way that the examinee responds to each frustrating situation depicts how they behave in the face of frustration . the worth of this test is based on how aggression is conceptualized into three types . the first direction of aggression can be extragressive meaning that it is turned onto the environment . the second direction is intraggressive meaning that it is turned by the examinee onto the self . the final direction is imaggressive which means that it is evaded in an attempt to gloss over the frustration . in terms of reliability and validity , the p-f study interscorer reliability is in the range of .80 to .85 . the test-retest reliability is fair to marginal . the test became popular in europe and was featured in stanley kubrick 's film a clockwork orange ( 1971 ) .a collection of rosenzweig 's papers has been maintained in the archives of the history of american psychology , at the university of akron . this comprises a collection of papers from 1929 to 2003 , in five series :

correspondence

== biography ==
born on june 30 , 1923 in porto san giorgio , italy , in 1928 she migrated with her family in australia because of the political situation in italy ; nibbi grew up in melbourne with an english education .
in 1947 , after the war and the fall of fascism , nibbi and her family temporarily returned to italy , and here she got married . in 1963 she came again to italy and during the journey she joined an excursion in egypt , where she became fascinated by ancient egyptian civilization at the point that once in italy she started to study archaeology at the university of perugia and later graduated at the university of florence .
shortly after , nibbi had to left italy for oxford , england . in 1969 she published the etruscans-themed the tyrrhenians , but a certain notoriety only came in 1972 with the self-published the sea–peoples : a re-examination of the egyptian sources , in which she suggested that `` the great green `` mentioned in egyptian records should not be identified with the mediterranean sea as usually done but rather with the verdant nile delta , and that ancient egyptians were not as much a seafaring civilization as thought ; at the time the book and the conclusions within were widely panned by mainstream academics .
since the journals started to refuse publishing her works , in 1985 nibbi founded her own review , the still-running discussions in egyptology , on which she published her successive studies on ancient egyptian geography centering on her reinterpretation of some narratives involving seafaring , such as the story of wenamun . in order to finding evidences for her claims , nibbi excavated in various egyptian coastal locations such as mersa matruh looking for anchors and other ancient naval technology.alessandra nibbi died on january 15 , 2007 in oxford , aged 83 .

= valdemar adolph thisted =
valdemar adolph thisted ( 28 february 1815 – 14 october 1887 ) was a danish writer , translator and priest . his works include novels , travelogues , romantic dramas and theological polemics . the writings published during his time as a pastor caused a stir because of their critical views on contemporary church issues . he is best known among english readers for his novel letters from hell .


== life and works ==
valdemar adolph thisted was the son of jorgen thisted ( 1795–1855 ) , lieutenant and later vicar of gyrstinge and flinterup , and marie elmquist ( 1790–1829 ) . he was born in aarhus . after his mother ’ s early death , when he was twelve years old , he moved to the home of his uncle , the war commissioner of elmquist in aarhus , and attended the town 's grammar school .
before he began his theological studies in copenhagen , he was for a time tutor in a manor house . upon graduation in 1840 , he set up a boys ’ school in skanderborg and in 1846 a secondary school . he later became an assistant professor in a secondary school in aarhus , resigning in 1853 . in 1855 he began ministering in northern schleswig . after suffering a nervous weakness , and a fall that required him to use crutches , he resigned in 1870 and moved to frederiksberg .
thisted was married twice . his first marriage was to henriette hansen ( 1815–1904 ) , a sister of the painter constantin hansen , and was dissolved . his second marriage was to elisha rasmussen ( 1830–1901 ) , who became completely paralyzed for 30 years .
thisted made his literary debut with the novel vandring i syden ( wandering in the south ) , published in 1843 . the following year he began the first of his travels to southern europe . his subsequent works included havfruen ( little mermaid , 1846 ) , tabt og funden ( lost and won , 1849 ) , episoder fra et reiseliv ( episodes from a reiseliv,1850 ) and romerske mosaiker ( roman mosaics , 1851 ) , the fruits of a journey to italy ; the novel sirenernes ö ( siren 's island , 1853 ) ; the romantic dramas hittebarnet ( abandoned child,1854 ) , neapolitaniske aquareller ( 1853 ) and hjemme og paa vandring ( home and on hiking , 1854 ) ; novelistic travel studies örkenens hjerte ( örkenens heart , 1849 ) , bruden ( bride,1851 ) and the novel familieskatten ( family tax , 1856 ) .
he published a volume of poems with religious and patriotic sentiments in 1862 .
his novel breve fra helvede ( briefe aus der hölle ) , published in copenhagen in 1866 , excited considerable attention and was translated into several languages . the sensuality that coloured his previous works has a stronger suit in these letters and certainly contributed to their success . it is his only work to have been translated into english , although a number of his works were translated into german .
worried by the offence caused by the book , thisted made a kind of penance in høgholt ( 1868 ) , some colorless , religious parables . høgholt was thisted 's last work . a nerve weakness compelled him to give up both office and authorship . he moved 1870 to frederiksberg , where he spent his seventeen years ' retirement plagued by illness and bitterness at the absence of the recognition he thought he deserved . he was buried in haderslev .
at its best , his work is characterised by a vivid descriptive power and rich fantasy but also suffers from monotony and prolixity . thisted also wrote under the pseudonyms emanuel st. hermidad , herodion and m.rowel .

= catherine lacugna =
catherine mowry lacugna ( august 6 , 1952 – may 3 , 1997 ) was a feminist catholic theologian and author of god for us . lacugna 's passion was to make the doctrine of the trinity relevant to the everyday life of modern christians .
lacugna earned her bachelor 's degree at seattle university , her masters and doctorate at fordham university , and joined the faculty at university of notre dame in 1981 . there , she taught systematic theology to graduate and undergraduate students , eventually holding the nancy reeves dreux chair of theology at the university of notre dame.catherine lacugna died at the age of 44 , of cancer , and is buried in the cedar grove cemetery on the notre dame campus .


== trinitarian theology ==
lacugna , a western theologian , sought common ground with eastern christians through re-examining early christian scholars or church fathers . she rejected modern individualist notions of personhood and emphasised the self-communication of god .
building on the work of karl rahner , lacugna argued that the `` demise of the doctrine of the trinity `` started when early church theologians had to respond to the teachings of arius , arch-heretic of the christian church . arius ' doctrine required a response , and the church fathers ' response began the theological trek into speculation on the inner , hidden life of god , commonly referred to as the immanent trinity . whereas before , theologians had concentrated on the nature of god as revealed in god 's actions in history ( commonly called the economic trinity ) .
according to lacugna , the church father augustine furthered this divide between economic and immanent trinity with his psychological model of the trinity , which described the inner life of god as being like a human 's memory , intellect , and will . the real culprit in this matter , though , was thomas aquinas , whose scholastic theology took theological speculation to a whole new level .
against rahner and karl barth ( in church dogmatics i/1 , §9 ) , lacugna wished to retain the use of the word persons in relation to the three persons of the trinity . rahner 's manners of subsisting and barth 's modes ( or ways ) of being she saw as too easily adopting the modern notion of individualistic personhood , instead of a relational and interdependent model .
lacugna says that god is known ontologically only through god 's self-revelation in the economy of salvation , and that `` theories about what god is apart from god 's self-communication in salvation history remain unverifiable and ultimately untheological . `` she says faithful trinitarian theology must be practical and include an understanding of our own personhood in relationship with god and each other , which she calls `` living god 's life with one another `` .lacugna 's doctrine of the trinity has been challenged by theologians such as nicholas lash and james william mcclendon , jr .


== awards ==
professor lacugna received two significant teaching awards from notre dame university . in 1993 she received the frank o'malley undergraduate teaching award , and she received the charles e. sheedy teaching award in 1996 .

william augustus schipp ( 1891-1967 ) is an australian-born explorer and plant collector : collected in northern australia , new guinea and java before moving to british honduras ( belize ) via san francisco . he collected in belize from 1929 to 1935 when he returned to australia because of failing health , living ultimately in new south wales . his health improved in australia where he was later employed as a landscape gardener by norman lindsay . in 1967 william augustus schipp living in retirement in a country town in new south wales die , leaving his few possessions to the local horticultural society , in which he was keenly interested .


== biography ==
william was born in silverton , near broken hill , new south wales to christian and barbara schipp ( née mcnair ) . christian , a builder and bricklayer , had come from germany in 1855 and followed the gold rush to broken hill and then kalgoorlie , western australia . william was the youngest of five children . he studied botany , especially flowering tropical plants .
william worked in the darwin botanical gardens and collected plants in new guinea , java and dutch east indies for several years prior to 1929 before moving to belize , perhaps with the catholic church .
he came to san francisco , california from tjondong , tjikandang , java in late january 1929 . at the university of california , berkeley he spent several days with ed merrill . schipp left san francisco passing through southern united states to new orleans where he boarded the ss abargarez for british honduras . on the evening of 28 january 1929 he arrived at belize , the capital and main port of the colony . early in february 1929 schipp left belize equipped with a brief outline map of the colony for the stann creek district directly south of belize district where he started collecting twenty specimens of each taxon in order to fulfill requests of his subscribers .
a pioneer , he made the first comprehensive collection of belize botany . his collections from british honduras are in many herbaria . herbarium sets distributed by william a schipp to european and american institutions represent one of the most significant and extensive collections ever made of the coastal plain flora for the stann creek and toledo districts of southern british honduras . he compiled the first complete flora of these districts in the form of a catalogue entitled `` flora of the british honduras , pricelist of seeds & herbarium material `` . as a professional botanical explorer , his discrimination in the field yielded a total of 154 taxa new to science , including two new genera - schippia and schizocardia . hardships were soon overcome by this keen and discriminative botanical explorer . whilst the most complete collections are thought to be at the field museum in chicago and the gentle herbarium in belmopan , belize .

anna robertson brown lindsay ( 1864–1948 ) was the first woman to earn a doctorate at the university of pennsylvania . she wrote a number of books on theological topics , most of which were published in the early-1900s . anna robertson brown lindsay was the daughter of a presbyterian minister and the first woman to graduate with a ph.d in english from the university of pennsylvania .
her certainty of god was at the center of her tenets on restructuring one 's life to dismiss the unimportant , irrelevant , and nonessential aspects of life . one line in her book , `` what is worth while `` provided enough insight to provide a lifetime of reflection . she writes , `` we may drop worry ... every moment of worry weakens the soul for its daily combat . worry is spiritual near-sightedness ; a fumbling way of looking at little things , and of magnifying their value . seen in their true relations , there is no experience of life over which one has a right to worry . god gives us always strength enough , and sense enough , for everything he wants us to do . ``

== history ==
born in st. louis , missouri on july 12 , 1924 , stix grew up near washington university . the stix family owned rice-stix inc. , a dry goods firm among largest businesses in st. louis at the turn of the 20th century . it continued operations until the 1950s . his family home on forsyth boulevard was eventually donated to washington university and is now the stix international house.stix graduated from john burroughs school and served in the u.s. army as a radio expert in the pacific theater during and after world war ii . after the war , he obtained his bachelor 's degree from caltech in 1948 and his doctorate from princeton in 1953.he worked for project matterhorn , a secret u.s. study of nuclear fusion , and developed the stix coil to contain gases that were heated to solar temperatures with electromagnetic waves . stix 's invention of the coil jump-started a period of intellectual productivity that revolutionized plasma heating research and whose influence is still felt in the field . exemplary of this period was stix 's 1975 paper “ fast wave heating of a two-component plasma , ” which remains one of the most cited papers ever published by the journal nuclear fusion.stix taught astrophysics at princeton , and did much of his research at the princeton plasma physics laboratory ( see model c stellarator ) . in 1978 , stix was appointed associate director for academic affairs at pppl . he pioneered and for many years served as director of princeton 's program in plasma physics , the first graduate-level program of its kind . in 1991 , princeton awarded its inaugural `` university award for distinguished teaching ” to stix for his contributions as a teacher and educator.in 1962 , stix was elected chair of the division of plasma physics of the american physical society . he received a guggenheim fellowship in 1969 , leading to the first of his three sabbaticals at the weizmann institute of science in israel.in 1980 , the american physical society awarded stix its highest honor in the plasma physics field , the james clerk maxwell prize in plasma physics , for his pioneering role in developing and formalizing the theory of wave propagation and wave heating in plasmas.in 1999 , he received the lifetime achievement award by fusion power associates.stix 's 1962 book , the theory of plasma waves , was translated into several foreign languages including japanese and russian . it received a paperback reprint in 2012 and still sells and is taught at universities around the world.stix and his wife , hazel sherwin , were married for 51 years and together had two children , susan stix fisher of new york , ny and dr. michael sherwin stix of lexington , ma . upon his death on april 16 , 2001 , of leukemia , stix and his wife had been longtime residents of princeton . his obituary in the new york times noted that stix 's `` elegant mastery of the literally infinite complexities of waves in electrified gases helped create a new field of science . `` the american physical society created the thomas h. stix award in stix 's honor in 2013 . the award is presented annually to a plasma physics researcher with outstanding contributions early in their career .

sidney william bijou ( november 12 , 1908 – june 11 , 2009 ) was an american developmental psychologist who developed an approach of treating childhood disorders using behavioral therapy , in which positive actions were rewarded and negative behaviors were largely ignored , rather than punished .


== early life ==
bijou was born in the arlington neighborhood of baltimore , maryland . he moved to brooklyn , new york with his family when he was 10 years old . he earned a degree in business administration at the university of florida in 1933 . he was awarded a master 's degree in psychology at columbia university in 1937 and earned his ph.d. in the field at the university of iowa in 1941 . together with joseph jastak , he developed the wide range achievement test , a comprehensive assessment of an individual 's ability in reading , comprehension , spelling , and mathematics . during world war ii , he served in the u.s. army air corps .


== career in psychology ==
he was hired by indiana university in 1946 , where he spent two years under pioneering behaviorist b. f. skinner . while other child psychologists had focused on use of techniques such as play therapy to identify the motives and causes of problematic behavior , bijou used skinner 's behavioral techniques to encourage positive behaviors through such rewards as praise , hugs and pieces of candy . children who were defiant would be given a time-out and separated from a group activity , with the expectation that the bad behavior would be its own punishment , and that any additional sanctions would not have a positive effect . a child isolated from a group would strive to behave appropriately in order to have the opportunity to rejoin the group.he relocated to the university of washington in 1948 , where he applied skinner 's techniques on children at the institute of child development , and wrote several textbooks in the field together with donald baer . studies he performed there showed that encouragement of good behavior would elicit more good behavior even from unruly children . ole ivar lovaas of the university of california , los angeles , one of the developers of applied behavior analysis therapy for autism , adapted bijou 's techniques to develop one of the most commonly used techniques of using rewards to enhance social skills of autistic children.in 1968 , together with donald baer , todd risley , james sherman , and montrose wolf , he established the journal of applied behavior analysis , as a peer-reviewed journal publishing research about experimental analysis of behavior and its practical applications . [ 5 ]
he relocated over the years to the university of illinois , the university of arizona ( from 1975 to 1993 ) and the university of nevada , reno ( from 1993 to 2001 ) , where he established similar behavioral programs . his


== personal life ==
bijou died at age 100 on june 11 , 2009 , after collapsing at his home in santa barbara , california . he had moved there to live with his daughter jude bijou following his wife 's death . he was survived by jude and a son . his wife died in 2000 ; they had been married for 67 years.his son recalled taking the family car for a joyride when he was 15 years old and being arrested by the police . at the police station , the officers offered several ideas for punishments for the misdeed , but dr. bijou rejected them all , stating that `` he 's already had punishment enough `` . his son recalled the incident , stating that `` sometimes it can pay off to have a psychologist for a father `` .

on october 11 , 1976 , the argentine military government ordered the closure of the publisher 's office in argentina accusing la biblia latinoamérica of promoting marxist ideals . however , these actions only popularized the book , which had been accused in other places as influenced by liberation theology , though in reality , bernard hurault was never a liberation theologian . rather , the commentaries he wrote for the latin american bible were steeped in the teachings of the fathers of the church . he himself said that he wanted to help the christian readers to go back to the first four hundred years of the church .
later , in 1986 hurault relocated to the philippines and began to supervise translations into english and the native languages of the philippines . the version appeared in english , then in tagalog , cebuano and ilongo . in 1990 , he embarked on the project to publish a version in chinese , first for those outside china , and then for the people of mainland china . his last years were spent in the philippines , but he died at eighty years in the city of concepcion ( chile ) , on december 14 , 2004 .

= edward vermilye huntington =
edward vermilye huntington ( april 26 , 1874 , clinton , new york , usa – november 25 , 1952 , cambridge , massachusetts , usa ) was an american mathematician .


== biography ==
huntington was awarded the b.a . and the m.a . by harvard university in 1895 and 1897 , respectively . after two years ' teaching at williams college , he began a doctorate at the university of strasbourg , which was awarded in 1901 . he then spent his entire career at harvard , retiring in 1941 . he taught in the engineering school , becoming professor of mechanics in 1919 . although huntington 's research was mainly in pure mathematics , he valued teaching mathematics to engineering students . he advocated mechanical calculators and had one in his office . he had an interest in statistics , unusual for the time , and worked on statistical problems for the usa military during world war i .
huntington 's primary research interest was the foundations of mathematics . he was one of the `` american postulate theorists `` ( according to michael scanlan , the expression is due to john corcoran ) , american mathematicians active early in the 20th century ( including e. h. moore and oswald veblen ) who proposed axiom sets for a variety of mathematical systems . in so doing , they helped found what are now known as metamathematics and model theory.huntington was perhaps the most prolific of the american postulate theorists , devising sets of axioms ( which he called `` postulates `` ) for groups , abelian groups , geometry , the real number field , and complex numbers . his 1902 axiomatization of the real numbers has been characterized as `` one of the first successes of abstract mathematics `` and as having `` filled the last gap in the foundations of euclidean geometry `` . huntington excelled at proving axioms independent of each other by finding a sequence of models , each one satisfying all but one of the axioms in a given set . his 1917 book the continuum and other types of serial order was in its day `` ... a widely read introduction to cantorian set theory `` ( scanlan 1999 ) . yet huntington and the other american postulate theorists played no role in the rise of axiomatic set theory then taking place in continental europe .
in 1904 , huntington put boolean algebra on a sound axiomatic foundation . he revisited boolean axiomatics in 1933 , proving that boolean algebra required but a single binary operation ( denoted below by infix '+ ' ) that commutes and associates , and a single unary operation , complementation , denoted by a postfix prime . the only further axiom boolean algebra requires is :

( a '+b ' ) '+ ( a '+b ) ' = a , now known as huntington 's axiom .
revising a method from joseph adna hill , huntington is credited with the method of equal proportions or huntington–hill method of apportionment of seats in the u.s. house of representatives to the states , as a function of their populations determined in the u.s. census [ 1 ] . this mathematical algorithm has been used in the u.s. since 1941 and is currently the method used .
in 1919 , huntington was the third president of the mathematical association of america , which he helped found as a charter member and its first vice-president . he was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1913 , and to the american philosophical society in 1933 . in 1942 he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association .

= johann severin vater =
johann severin vater ( german : [ ˈfaːtɐ ] ; may 27 , 1771 , altenburg – march 16 , 1826 , halle ) was a german theologian , biblical scholar , and linguist .


== biography ==
he was a student and professor at jena and halle . in 1809 , he became professor at königsberg . in 1820 , he resumed his chair at halle . although he taught theology , he is chiefly known as a philologist .


== work ==
following alexander geddes , he applied the fragmentary hypothesis to the whole of the pentateuch , treating it as an aggregate of numerous minor documents that had been compiled together . vater 's major work , commentar über den pentateuch was published in three volumes in halle between 1802 and 1806 . this work 's primary purpose was to advance the supplementary hypothesis against the earlier documentarian endeavors of jean astruc , johann gottfried eichhorn , and karl david ilgen . many of vater 's conclusions – most prominently , his assertion of the late nature of the pentateuch as compared to the historical books – mirror the independent work of wilhelm martin leberecht de wette , whose beiträge zur einleitung in das alte testament was published in 1806-7 . against de wette , though , vater supposed , based on historical book allusions to deuteronomy , that at least some parts of deuteronomy had existed prior to the collection of the pentateuch .


== writings ==
besides the commentar , his works include :

hebrew grammar ( 1797 )
handbuch der hebräischen , syrischen , chaldäischen und arabischen grammatik ( 1801 )
polish grammar ( 1807 )
russian grammar ( 1809 )

= johann karl nestler =
johann karl nestler , czech : jan karel nestler ( 16 december 1783 – 9 july 1842 ) was a czech-german scientist in the field of hereditary traits , professor of natural history and agriculture at the philosophical faculty of university of olomouc , dean of the faculty and rector of the university , and doyen of the czech agriculture science .


== biography ==
nestler studied philosophy , theology and law in years 1800–06 at the olomouc academical lyceum ( the university of olomouc was degraded to academical lyceum in 1782–1826 ) . then in years 1806–12 he was an educator in althart / staré hobzí and in years 1812–18 he was a director of a high school in klafterbrunn , lower austria . in years 1818–20 he received technical education in agriculture . he studied agriculture at the university of vienna in years 1820–21 , where he later also worked as adjunct at the department of agriculture.in year 1823 nestler became the professor of agriculture , and in 1824 also of natural history , at the academy of nobility and at the academical lyceum in olomouc . after the lyceum was restored to university status , nestler obtained doctorate of philosophy . in 1835 he became the rector of the university and in 1837 he became the dean of its faculty of philosophy .
during his teaching nestler included a special section dealing with scientific animal and plant breeding . his main emphasis was on sheep breeding to improve wool protection for the benefit of the textile industry . in his published lectures nestler ( 1829 ) encouraged sheep breeders to elaborate the theoretical basis of the selection process . nestler also tried to explain how nature produces new species of animals and plants through forces beyond the hand of man and how breeders control the reproductive process and use modifications , such as inbreeding or outcrossing , for increased production.through the examination of the registers of the best stock animals and their offspring nestler hoped to explain the german : vererbungsgeschichte ( genetic history ) . examination of the records of the ancestors of the best breeding animals , called by nestler developmental history ( german : entwicklunggeschichte ) was for him the reverse side of the same coin . according to wood and orel the search for rules of heredity in sheep created an atmosphere of enquiry about heredity in general , which had influence on later work of gregor johann mendel , himself a student at the faculty of philosophy in 1840–43.nestler was also a very active member of the moravian-silesian society for advancement of agriculture ( german : mähr.-schles . ges . zur beförderung des ackerbaues , natur- und landeskde . , in which he , among other things , organized the 4th international congress of farmers and foresters ( 1st time in the lands under control of austrian habsburgs ) in brno in 1840 . he was also member of many similarly oriented associations and wrote a lot of literature on the topic .

= fielding lucas jr. =
fielding lucas jr. ( 1781–1854 ) was a cartographer , an artist and a publisher of prominence during the early 19th century . he is known as the earliest successful commercial map-publisher in the city of baltimore . the first of his atlases was published in 1815–17 , in which the maps are closely associated with the 1822 edition of philadelphia atlas by carey & lea .


== career history ==

lucas founded lucas bros. inc. in 1804 which was located at 116 , east baltimore street , and became the first stationer in the united states . in 1806 lucas served as the baltimore manager of the philadelphia publishing firm , conrad , lucas , and co. , when it opened its offices there .
in 1834 , lucas published the first `` the metropolitan catholic calendar and laity 's directory `` - an annual calendar , which was renamed to `` metropolitan catholic almanac `` by him in 1838 . in the issue of 1845 there is inserted a map of the united states , `` prepared at much expense to exhibit at a glance the extent and relative situation of the different dioceses `` , with a table of comparative statistics from 1835 to 1845 . a list of the clergy in england and ireland was added in the volume for 1850 . because of lucas and a younger contemporary , ireland-born john murphy , baltimore was the major center of catholic publishing until it shifted to new york city at the beginning of the twentieth century .
in 1866 , his son , william f. lucas , acquired the lucas bros. printing and stationery business .


=== books and atlases ===
below are some of the books published by lucas :

a new and elegant general atlas : containing maps of each of the united states ( 1814 ) ( asin b0008cqoe6 )
a general atlas containing distinct maps of all the known countries in the world ( 1825 ) ( asin b00086f6gy )
lucas ' progressive drawing book ( 3 parts ) ( 1827 ) ( asin b00086ek3o )
picture of baltimore : containing a description of all objects of interest in the city ; and embellished with views of the principal public buildings ( 1832 )


== commemorations ==

as an artist , lucas helped publish one of the first color plate books titled `` flora 's dictionary `` , for which an 1837 review reads thus : `` one of the most popular genres of color plate books in the antebellum period were those devoted to the sentiments associated with flowers . colored illustrations of flowers were accompanied by a text which guided the reader through the hidden meanings of different blooms , with quotations and poetry appropriate to each . this is a pioneering example of this type , issued by the publishers of many early books with color , fielding lucas of baltimore . similar works were issued at every level of quality and size , from pocket-sized volumes with crude plates to highly finished folios . ``
david rumsey states that , `` while the same base maps were used ... the maps in [ this ] lucas atlas are far superior in quality – welch re-engraved many of the maps for lucas that young & delker has engraved for carey & lea . ``
rumsey further notes that the `` lucas general atlas `` of 1823 was the `` finest general atlas produced in the u.s. at the time `` , setting aside the tanner and finley atlases as specialized publications .

françois valentijn ( 17 april 1666 – 6 august 1727 ) was a dutch minister , naturalist and author whose oud en nieuw oost-indiën ( `` old and new east-india `` ) describes the history of the dutch east india company and the countries of the far east .
françois valentijn was born in 1666 in dordrecht , holland , where he lived most his life ; however , he is known for his activities in the tropics , notably in ambon , in the maluku archipelago . valentijn read theology and philosophy at the university of leiden and the university of utrecht before leaving for a career as a preacher in the indies .
in total , valentijn lived in the east indies 16 years . valentijn was first employed by the v.o.c . ( vereenigde oost-indische compagnie ) at the age of 19 as minister to the east indies , where he became a friend of the german naturalist georg eberhard rumpf ( rumphius ) . he returned and lived in holland for about ten years before returning to the indies in 1705 where he was to serve as army chaplain on an expedition in eastern java . he finally returned to dordrecht where he found time to write his oud en nieuw oost-indiën ( 1724–26 ) a massive work of five parts published in eight volumes and containing over one thousand engraved illustrations and some of the most accurate maps of the indies of the time . he died in the hague , netherlands , in 1727 .
valentijn probably had access to the v.o.c . 's archive of maps and geographic trade secrets , which they had always guarded jealously . johannes van keulen ii ( d. 1755 ) became hydrographer to the v.o.c . at the time valentijn 's oud en nieuw oost-indiën was published . it was in the younger van keulen 's time that many of the voc charts were first published , one signal of the decline of dutch dominance in the spice trade . one uncommon grace afforded valentijn was that he lived to see his work published ; the voc ( dutch east india company ) strictly enforced a policy prohibiting former employees from publishing anything about the region or their colonial administration . and while , as thomas suárez notes , by the mid-18th century the dutch no longer feared sharing geographic secrets , e. m. beekman notes how `` the execution of this policy was erratic and based on personal motives `` .while valentijn 's maps and diagrams were prized possessions , his scholarship , judging by 21st-century standards was unscrupulous . valentijn 's use of the products of other scientists ' and writers ' intellectual labour , passing it off as his own , reveals a penchant for self-aggrandisement . beekman nevertheless cites him as an important figure and , given his writing style , diction and aptitude for narrative , one of the greatest dutch prose writers of the time .

cyrus alger ( born in west bridgewater , massachusetts , 11 november 1781 ; died in boston , 4 february 1856 ) was a united states arms manufacturer and inventor .


== biography ==
early in life alger became an iron founder , training in one of his father 's three foundries in the boston area , in easton , massachusetts . in 1809 , he worked with thomas handasyd perkins , likely tied to perkins 's interest in the monkton iron works in vergennes , vermont . initially monkton aimed to provide iron to american consumers while the embargo stymied foreign competition . while the embargo 's end threatened business , the war of 1812 created a new market for monkton . the company supplied the american government with large numbers of cannon balls as well as iron to join the timbers in constructing frigates.in 1817 alger incorporated the south boston iron company in dorchester , massachusetts . through his firm 's success , the region became a hub for iron manufacturing .

alger was one of the best practical metallurgists of his time . his numerous patents of improved processes show a continued advance in the art . the first gun ever rifled in america was made at his works in 1834 , and the first perfect bronze cannon was made at his foundry for the u. s. ordnance department , the mortar “ columbiad , ” the largest gun of cast iron that had then been made in the united states , was cast under his personal supervision.alger also devised numerous improvements in the construction of time fuses for bomb shells and grenades . in 1811 he patented a method of making cast-iron chilled rolls , and in 1822 first designed cylinder stoves . alger served as a member of the city council during the first year of its existence , and was elected alderman in 1824 and 1827.he is buried in union cemetery in south boston .

dr. maynard jack `` doc `` ramsay ( november 22 , 1914 – march 20 , 2005 ) was an american entomologist noted for his efforts to track and eradicate exotic parasites carried in flowers , fruits and other cargoes arriving from overseas . he was listed in american men of science and who 's who in america .
during his 36 years in government service , he often was called upon to provide his beetle expertise to the smithsonian institution and entomological organizations in the united states and elsewhere . he once provided entomological advice to writer john steinbeck and found himself quoted on the subject of killer bees in the opening of arthur herzog 's best-selling novel `` the swarm `` .


== work ==
ramsay was widely known for his research on a potato cyst eelworm — the parasitic golden nematode ( globodera rostochiensis ) . the worm was discovered in 1941 in potato fields on long island , new york , the only state where it has established a foothold . around 1946 , the worm was found on a lily of the valley plants imported from the netherlands . ramsay helped trace the worm to infested flower fields in germany that had been converted for potato cultivation during world war ii . inspectors from the department of agriculture began testing cargoes of lilies in hamburg , which initially slowed the golden nematode 's spread from across the atlantic . the golden nematode act was enacted on june 15 , 1948 , to combat the worm . [ 1 ] as of 2003 , the golden nematode is one of 22 federally regulated organisms in the united states . [ 2 ] according to society of nematologists , `` he played an instrumental role in reducing the spread of globodera rostochiensis in the united states . `` [ 3 ]
he also studied dutch elm disease , termite infestations in puerto rico , and mexican bean beetles in new york state , and helped develop methods for estimating losses from the parasites . he later trained inspectors from japan , el salvador , jordan , and indonesia in an effort to identify infested crops before they reached american shores . when those crops were found , agriculture officials usually ordered the cargoes dumped at sea and the ships fumigated . raymond f. bednar , a former director of the animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) in new york , recalled that ramsay `` always saw the new pest coming down the pike . ``


== life ==
ramsay was born and raised in buffalo by his mother lillian maynard and father william `` dowie `` ramsay , a conductor and brakeman for the nickel plate road . ramsay studied under albert r. shadle and graduated from the university at buffalo with a bachelor of science degree in biology . continuing his education at cornell university , ramsay graduated with a master of science degree in mammalogy .
while living in staten island , ramsay was awarded a ph.d. in entomology from cornell in 1941 , and gained employment with the u.s. department of agriculture . ramsay was one of the first few ph.d. holders in service to the department , and thus , colleagues bestowed him with the nickname `` doc `` . encouraged by shadle , `` doc `` ramsay then married alberta june wentworth , a beautician and owner of alberta 's beauty shop , from canisteo .
from 1950 to 1956 , he served as a port entomologist , and then in 1967 was appointed to aphis . he retired in 1977 . dr. ramsay was also a former president of the insecticide society of washington .
alberta ramsay died in 2003 . two years later , maynard ramsay died of pneumonia on march 20 , 2005 , in a silver spring nursing home . the couple resided in bowie , maryland .

caleb evans ( 25 july 1831 – 16 september 1886 ) , was an english geologist .
evans , born on 25 july 1831 , was educated under professor key at university college school . the death of his father compelled him to leave school at an early age , and in 1846 he began work in a solicitor 's office . in 1852 evans was appointed a clerk in the chancery pay office , a post he held until 1882 , when his health enforced his retirement . he never married ; his residence was at hampstead , where he lived with his brother and sisters . evans commenced the study of geology by attending lectures delivered in 1855 by professor owen and dr. melville . in 1858 he began to collect fossils from the tertiary formations of the south of england , and formed during the next twenty-five years very complete sets illustrating the strata of the london district . he also investigated the strata of the isle of wight , lyme regis , weymouth , swanage , and portsmouth .
in 1857 evans took part in founding the geologists ' association of london , of which he was for many years one of the most active members , and in 1867 he was elected a fellow of the geological society . he was fortunate in being able to take advantage of the operations in connection with the main drainage works in the south of london , which afforded opportunities for collecting fossils never likely to recur . he secured suites of specimens of fossil shells of great interest and rarity . evans also did excellent work in studying the chalk . he made large collections of its fossils , and his paper ‘ on some sections of chalk between croydon and oxted , ’ read to the geologists ' association in january 1870 , marks the first english attempt to divide this immensely thick mass of pure white limestone into several zones , and to correlate these zones with those that continental geologists had already established .
altogether evans was the author of eleven papers on geological subjects , eight of which appeared in the ‘ proceedings ’ of the geologists ' association , including the paper on the chalk mentioned above , along with `` geology of the neighbourhood of portsmouth and ryde `` . his other work included sketch of the geology of faringdon in the ‘ geologist ’ for august 1866 , and ‘ mill hill in former ages , ’ written for the mill hill magazine . many of evans 's papers were also published separately .
evans constructed several geological models or relief maps , his method being to paste layer upon layer of cartridge paper so as to secure the necessary elevations , and then to colour the whole according to the outcrop of the rocks . his models of the valley of the thames near london , of a part of the same on a larger scale , and one of the whole of england , were passed to h. j. lister of eldon road , hampstead after evans ' death ; a map or model of the country round hastings is in the possession of the corporation of that town ; he also constructed a model of the neighbourhood of sidmouth . evans 's extensive collections of fossils were purchased by mr. ernest westlake of fordingbridge .
evans died on 16 september 1886 .

= henry pachter =
henry pachter was a marxist intellectual and a libertarian socialist activist . perhaps best known as an essayist , who dealt with both historical and political matters , he also authored a number of books on a variety of subjects . an exile from the nazi regime , deeply concerned with the lessons offered by the weimar republic , he taught at the new school for social research and then at the city college of the city university of new york until his death in 1980 .


== biography ==
born in 1907 in berlin , pachter joined the german youth movement as a teenager and , following a split in its ranks , the german communist party ( kpd ) in 1926 . he enrolled in the history department at the university of berlin and , by 1928 , found himself expelled from the kpd . he then joined the social democratic party ( spd ) , where he worked under rudolf hilferding at the legendary journal , society , and finished his dissertation in 1932 on “ the proletariat before 1848 . ” he would remain a libertarian socialist for the rest of his life . by the end of 1933 , pachter had been forced to flee to paris where he took odd jobs , taught at the universite populaire , agitated for creating a “ popular front ” of all antifascist forces , and ultimately served as a publicist for the poum , a mixed group of trotskyist and socialists that served the loyalist cause during the spanish civil war . briefly a member of the anti-nazi underground in which he helped edit probably the first resistance journal , proletarian action , he wound up in the gurs prison camp , before coming to the united states in 1940 . soon enough he was working for the office of strategic services , and part-time for the institute for social research at columbia university , before becoming a founding member of dissent and entering the academy .


== theoretical contributions ==
henry pachter understood marxism as a critical method capable of questioning its political employment from a historical and materialist standpoint that emphasized the ability of the working class ( rather than a party ) to control its destiny . he never viewed it as a “ science ” or a form of economics guaranteeing the inevitable victory of the proletariat . in this respect , his intellectual lineage derived from karl korsch and the libertarian socialism associated with rosa luxemburg . his writings were primarily inspired by his political commitments : a work on the weimar republic and the spanish civil war ; a study of economic policy under mussolini and another dealing with the fascist use of language ; the character of authoritarian political parties ; foreign policy ; the role of reform , and the meaning of socialism . in pachter ’ s view , socialism exhibited a fundamental tension between its need to engage the world even as it projects a vision of society as it should be . that tension prevented pachter from identifying socialism with any movement or party . indeed , as he once put the matter : “ one can not have socialism ; one is a socialist . ”

susannah `` susie `` hennessy o'reilly ( 25 january 1881 – 18 june 1960 ) was a family doctor and obstetrician who practiced on the north shore in sydney in the first half of the 20th century . despite graduating fourth in her year from medicine at the university of sydney , her application for residency at sydney hospital in 1905 was rejected in favour of male applicants with a poorer academic record .


== family ==
o'reilly was born the third of eight children in sydney , to mary narcissa o'reilly ( née taylor ) and walter william joseph o'reilly . her father , grandfather and great-grandfather were all physicians , as were three of susie 's siblings : her brothers , linnell ( 1879–1948 ) and merrick ( 1892–1957 ) and her sister olive ( 1892-1976 ) , all of whom graduated from medicine at the university of sydney and who were appointed to appointed sydney hospital in 1906 , perth general hospital in 1914 , and brisbane general hospital in 1916 , respectively . both olive and merrick worked in the family practice in pymble . her brother walter cresswell o'reilly ( 1877–1954 ) , was a public servant and film censor .


== education ==
o'reilly attended the methodist ladies college , burwood from 1894 to 1898 . she was dux of the school in 1897 and passed her senior year in 1898 , matriculating with first class honours in french.she graduated from the university of sydney with a bachelor of science in 1903 and a bachelor of medicine and master of surgery in 1905 .


== career ==
upon graduating , o'reilly undertook an internship at the royal adelaide hospital in 1906-1907 , the queen victoria hospital , melbourne , and the royal hospital for women , paddington , and joined her father 's practice in sydney in 1908 where she worked until her retirement in 1948 . in 1921 , she co-founded the new south wales association of registered medical women and , in 1922 , was made a foundation member of the rachel forster hospital for women and children working there as a consulting physician from 1926-1941 and holding a position as life governor from 1959 to her death in 1960 . she also co-founded her school 's old girls ' union , serving as its president ; was a medical adviser to the presbyterian ladies ' college , pymble , and the kindergarten training college , waverley , and a foundation member of the national trust of australia .


== rejection from sydney hospital ==
o'reilly applied for a residency at sydney university in 1905 whereupon she was rejected in favour of five men . two of these had come first and second , respectively , in their graduating year , but three had received only pass degrees in comparison with o'reilly 's top four placing and honours degree . although the women 's progressive association of new south wales had been advised by sydney hospital two years earlier that `` when it is necessary to make appointments to the medical staff , applications are invited through the press , with no restrictions as to sex `` , the board offered the excuse that there was no suitable accommodation for a female resident medical officer . however , while this may have been the case , aspiring female physicians in sydney had a difficult time being accepted into the hospital system . women were first admitted to the sydney medical school ( founded in 1856 ) in 1885 , and the first females graduated in 1893 . reports from the time suggest that this attitude was in contrast to favourable opportunities to study medicine , where no distinctions in teaching were made between the sexes at the sydney medical school . susie 's rejection became the focus of media attention and public debate in the form of editorials and letters to the newspapers about the discrimination and roles of female doctors.in 1906 , the royal prince alfred hospital began to admit female residents and the sydney hospital began admitting female residents in 1910 .


== later life ==
o'reilly was a bushwalker and botanist and a foundation member of the national trust of australia . died on 18 june 1960 at her home in pymble , new south wales . she was cremated .

menso alting ( eelde , 9 november 1541 – emden , 7 october 1612 ) was a dutch reformed preacher and reformer .
menso alting was born in eelde and was raised in a catholic family . after visiting several schools in the netherlands and germany , he studied theology at cologne . in 1564 he was named vicar to haren . a few months later he was named pastor of sleen . menso alting probably never visited sleen and haren , instead using the functions , which had been given thanks to influential family-members , as a source of income .
in 1565 , during his study menso joined the protestant reformation . he continued his studies in heidelberg . after finished his studies menso alting travelled back to helpen , now a district of groningen and sleen , this time to convert the inhabitants to calvinism .
as a result of the protestant persecutions in the netherlands after the beeldenstorm , menso alting fled to germany in july 1567 . travelling through leiselheim ( at worms ) , dirmstein ( at frankenthal ) and heidelberg he eventually reached emden in east-frisia in 1575 . around this time about half of the city 's inhabitants were protestant refugees from the netherlands ; an estimated 6000 dutch people went to emden during the second half of the 16th century .
in october 1575 he became preacher of the great church in emden , as well as a political leader . he succeeded the dutch reformer albertus risaeus , who had died in 1574 . alting caused a breakthrough for calvinism in emden . shortly after he became preacher , countess anna von oldenburg died . menso alting led the calvinistic funeral services .
count william louis , stadtholder of friesland , invited menso alting to drenthe in 1594 to preach there . from this period menso alting received his nickname the reformer of drenthe . it is known that he used a hunebed as pulpit for his sermons . this hunebed is still locally known as the popeless church .
in march 1595 , menso alting played a large role in the rebellion of the calvinistic inhabitants of emden against the lutheran count of east-frisia , edzard ii . menso , who hoped that emden would join the dutch republic , roused the population . not long after the city declared itself independent from east-frisia . in the treaty of delfzijl on 15 july 1595 , emden received a semi-autonomous status , which it would keep until 1744 .
menso alting died at the age of seventy in emden .

== biography ==
hayashi was born in edo as the second son of hayashi gonhyoue yoshimichi , a 600 koku hatamoto who served the tokugawa shogunate as commissioner for documents . however , when hayashi was only three years old , his father was expelled for some reason and became a ronin . hayashi and his brother were brought up by his uncle hayashi jyūgo , a physician .
however , hayashi had an elder sister , kiyo , in the service of date yoshimura at the date clan residence in edo . she became the concubine of the 6th daimyō of sendai domain , date munemura . through her influence , hayashi jyūgo received an appointment as official doctor to sendai domain with a stipend of 150 koku , and hayashi 's brother hayashi kazen was adopted as his heir . on date yoshimura 's death , they moved to sendai ; however , hayashi himself had no official post or stipend , and remained unemployed within the household .
he wrote a poem called `` six no 's `` , which reads : `` i have no parents , no wife , no son , no block for printing , no money , and i wish for 'no death ' . ``
however , hayashi was not idle . he maintained an active correspondence with many of the leading rangaku scholars , economists and military scientists of the day . he also travelled to nagasaki in 1777 where he was especially impressed with the size and strength of the dutch ships , and learned of russian intentions to advance south from siberia into asia from the dutch opperhoofd . the caused him to make a journey to matsumae in the north , and he increasing became aware of the weaknesses of the country 's coastal defences , and ignorance of the outside world .
in 1786 , he published sangoku tsūran zusetsu ( illustrated description of three countries ) , describing in detail japan 's geopolitical position in relation to korea , ryukyu and ezo . he raised concerns that china may one day attempt to invade japan , as had been attempted in the kamakura period , and also emphasized the need for japan to populate and develop its northern frontier in hokkaido .
in 1787 , he published kaikoku heidan ( i.e . military defense of a maritime nation ) , a 16-volume work in which he stressed japan 's vulnerability from the sea and need for japan to adopt western military science and the re-education of the samurai . he complained of the lack of organized drill exercises , and stressed the importance of chōren , or teamwork drill , rather than mere individual martial training . he gave technical descriptions about shipbuilding , cannons and other military designs.he especially was critical of the shogunate 's sakoku national isolation policy . the work generated great interest , but was banned in may 1792 , on the grounds that national security matters were being discussed without official consent . hayashi was placed under house arrest . he died the following year.together with takayama hikokurō and gamō sanbei , hayashi is known as one of the `` three excelling men of the kansei period `` ( kansei no san-kijin 寛政の三奇人 ) .

== scientific achievements ==
in addition to leading the national program to develop facilities for scientific ballooning , lally made a number of major contribution to the use of balloons as a vehicle for atmospheric measurements . the demonstration of the capability to fly superpressure balloons on multiple orbits of the globe was the critical experiment which triggered international support for the global atmospheric research program . in 1966 , ncar scientists launched a globe-circling balloon from christchurch , new zealand . this was one of a series of global horizontal sounding technique ( ghost ) balloons tested in order to collect meteorological data from all of the earth 's atmosphere and predict global weather on a long-range basis . the rocket-balloon-instrument sphere ( robin ) , designed in 1955 , was the principal vehicle for rocket soundings of the atmosphere . lally also developed the technique for reliable erection of space-inflatables . the radiation-controlled balloon ( racoon ) demonstrated in 1980 that the radiation-environment rather than ballast could achieve long-duration flight for zero-pressure balloons . it became the standard technique for global flight and recovery of heavy scientific payloads .


== publications ==
lally authored over 30 papers on instrumentation , ballooning , and navigation techniques . he wrote the definitive publication on superpressure-ballooning as well as chapters in several handbooks on ballooning and atmospheric sounding systems .

after receiving work in the main church of wolfenbüttel knittel started to examine manuscripts housed in the ducal library of wolfenbüttel . in 1756 he studied the codex guelferbytanus 64 weissenburgensis . the manuscript and its palimpsest text had earlier been examined by heusinger , who described it in 1752 , but knittel was the first who recognized that the palimpsest greek text belonged to two different manuscripts of the new testament . knittel designated these two texts by sigla a and b . he recognized also lists of the κεφαλαια ( chapters ) as another , the third greek manuscript . knittel also deciphered and reconstructed the gothic-latin text of the palimpsest and published it in 1762 at brunswick . it is known as codex carolinus . the upper text of palimpsest contains text of isidore of seville 's origines and his six letters . knittel designated it by siglum e and dated it to the 11th century .
knittel made many errors in deciphering the palimpsest 's text , especially in the latin text of codex carolinus ( e.g . enarrabilia for scrutabilia ) . tischendorf made a new and more accurate collation for the latin text ( edited in 1855 ) . a new collation of the gothic text was published by carla falluomini in 1999 . knittel examined also other manuscripts ( e.g . minuscule 126 , 429 ) .
knittel defended a traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism . he defended an authenticity of the pericopa adulterae ( john 7:53-8:11 ) , comma johanneum ( 1 john 5:7 ) , and testimonium flavianum . according to him erasmus in his novum instrumentum omne did not incorporate the comma from codex montfortianus , because of grammar differences , but used complutensian polyglotta . according to him the comma was known for tertullian .

=== neutrino theory of light ===
this theory , which dates from 1934 , introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two dirac neutrinos .
it shows that the movement of the center of gravity of these two particles obeys the maxwell equations—that implies that the neutrino and the photon both have rest masses that are non-zero , though very low .


=== hidden thermodynamics ===
de broglie 's final idea was the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles . it is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics : the principles of fermat , maupertuis , and carnot .
in this work , action becomes a sort of opposite to entropy , through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form :

= martin deutsch =
martin deutsch ( 29 january 1917 – 16 august 2002 ) was an austrian-american professor of physics at mit . he is best known for being the discoverer of positronium .


== early life ==
deutsch was born in vienna during the first world war to a jewish family . both of his parents were physicians ; his mother helene deutsch was a professor of psychiatry at the university of vienna and a student and colleague of sigmund freud .
in 1934 , after the fascist seizure of power in austria , deutsch moved to zürich , switzerland . he completed secondary school there and attended the swiss federal institute of technology for one semester .
the following year , young martin deutsch accompanied his mother on a trip to the united states . during their outbound journey , the italians invaded ethiopia ; the family decided that it would be best to resettle in america . they moved to cambridge , massachusetts , where both parents became influential psychiatrists .
deutsch enrolled at mit , where he excelled at mathematics and physics . he received his bs degree in 1937 , after two years of study . in 1939 , he married suzanne zeitlin , a native bostonian who had just graduated from simmons college with a master 's degree in social work . they had two children , l. peter deutsch and nicholas deutsch . martin earned his ph.d. in physics in 1941 , under robley d. evans leading to a thesis entitled : a study of nuclear radiations by means of a magnetic lens beta ray spectrometer .


== work on the manhattan project ==
since deutsch was still a german subject in 1941 ( germany annexed austria in 1938 ; under the nuremberg laws , jews were stripped of their citizenship and considered `` subjects `` of the reich ) , he was classified by the u.s. government as an enemy alien . deutsch was a committed anti-fascist , and wanted to help in the war effort , and so he had to wait for two years to receive a security clearance . during that time , he taught and did research at mit .
deutsch arrived at los alamos in 1943 , and began working closely with emilio segrè on problems concerning fission physics . he also worked with his future colleague at mit , victor weisskopf . as it turned out , they had attended the same high school in vienna , but not at the same time : weisskopf graduated the year that deutsch entered the school .


== career at mit ==
deutsch returned to mit in 1946 , joining his los alamos colleagues victor weisskopf and bruno rossi . one of his students was henry kendall , who won the nobel prize for physics in 1990 . he also recruited samuel c. c. ting to the faculty ; ting was awarded the nobel prize for physics in 1976 .
in 1951 , deutsch measured and confirmed the existence of positronium , a bound state of electrons and positrons whirling about each other . the properties of positronium were predicted by carl d. anderson of caltech in 1932 .
the martin deutsch student award was created in 1987 to recognize outstanding experimental work by an mit physics graduate student .
deutsch died in 2002 at his home in cambridge , massachusetts .

johan fredrik victorin ( 24 february 1831 kvarns bruk , kristberg , sweden - 3 november 1855 kvarns bruk , kristberg ) was a noted swedish zoologist and explorer in south africa . he died at only 24 years of age , soon after returning from his african trip , having collected a large number of natural history specimens including over 2000 insects.he was the eldest son of per henric victorin ( 1790–1857 ) , an industrialist from kvarns bruk , and his cousin 'hedda ' hedvig lovisa westring ( 1804–1864 ) , the daughter of johan petter westring , physician to karl xiv johan of sweden . johan fredrik 's siblings were carl henrik victorin , eric gabriel victorin , axel rickard victorin , august christoffer victorin , ture otto victorin and per arvid victorin .
johan fredrik was first home-schooled by his father before attending a primary school in linköping in 1844 and then a high school in 1847 . he proved to have a sharp mind and excellent memory , with a talent for drawing and painting . natural history , and in particular vertebrate zoology , soon captured his interest . in the autumn of 1851 he enrolled at uppsala university , studying natural history and mathematics . throughout the summer of 1852 he studied the birds on the island of öland .
victorin suffered chronic tuberculosis , which eventually led to his death , and in an effort to convalesce he left for the cape of good hope . docking in cape town on 11 november 1853 he set about collecting in the vicinity . he happened to meet fellow naturalist johan august wahlberg , who advised him to extend his travels to the eastern parts of the cape . on 27 february 1854 he sailed to mossel bay and then overland to george and knysna . he stayed there until 1 december , finding a rich collecting ground in the forests . he became acquainted with members of the george rex family , travelled to plettenberg bay , with excursions to westford and redburn . returning to george he crossed over montagu pass into the little karoo , staying on the farms roodeval ( now van wykskraal ) and zeekoegat , near oudtshoorn , until february 1855 . his health declined over this period . he visited to the cango caves on 8 february , sailing for cape town from mossel bay on 9 march . nine days later he sailed for sweden and settled in qvarn , where he died later that year.victorin 's collection from the cape included 83 mammals ( of 30 species ) , 517 birds ( 153 species ) , and 20 amphibians ( 14 species ) . the birds he prepared and preserved by himself . he also collected 31 bird 's eggs ( 11 species ) , some 2000 insects , several shells and other invertebrates , plants , seeds , bulbs , and lichens . two mammals and two birds from his collection were new to science . generally his specimens were well prepared and his descriptions meticulous . most of his collection was housed in the royal swedish academy of sciences which became the swedish museum of natural history . most of his insects were coleoptera ; his hemiptera and orthoptera were described by carl stål ( 1856 , 1871 ) and the diptera by hermann loew ( 1858 , 1860 , 1862 ) . the hemipteroid pentatoma victorini was named after the collector .
victorin 's notes on his collections at the cape were edited by j.w . grill and published as `` zoologiska anteckningar `` in the `` proceedings of the royal academy of science `` . two new bird descriptions by carl jakob sundevall were included in this paper and one of them was named bradypterus victorini ( now cryptillas victorini , victorin 's warbler ) . grill also published a book in 1863 compiled from victorin 's letters and diaries , `` j.f . victorins resa i kaplandet åren 1853-1855 `` .

= bill swartley =
william swartley ( 1927–1979 ) was a canadian psychologist who pioneered the primal integration mode of personal exploration.dr . swartley was the founder of the centers for the whole person in philadelphia , mays landing , nj , new york , and toronto . he was also a founder , in 1973 , of the international primal association and was its first executive secretary . he was educated at haverford college , the university of tübingen , the jung institute of zurich , the california institute of integral studies , the university of the pacific , and during significant time spent in india .
swartley was influenced by the work of carl jung , roberto assagioli , r.d . laing , frederick leboyer , fritz perls , alexander lowen , stanislav grof , alan watts , thomas verny , paul bindrim and many others .
he was active in the american psychological association and promoted international cooperation in psychology in his workshops throughout north america and europe .
swartley developed 'primal integration ' starting from about 1962 . he summarized this development as follows :

primal integration is one of a number of primally oriented human maturation techniques which have evolved during the 1970 's ... the third 'new ' thing about primal techniques is the adaption i have developed for use with average , maturing adults , called primal integration . primal integration utilizes regressive techniques with average adults within an educational rather than a therapeutic framework . that is , primal integration rejects the authoritarian medical model of treatment , and is an education rather than a therapy ... primal integration , is a contribution of the encounter group movement which began on the east and west coasts of the united states during 1962 , grandfathered by maslow and perls . thus , primal integration may be viewed historically as a child of the union of regressive psychotherapy and the encounter movement . ( swartley1975 )
he devoted the last ten years of his life promoting primal integration through workshops , training , lectures , and writings until his death in 1979 at the age of 52 .
dr. johann-georg raben ( ph.d. ) , a german psychologist , has written his doctoral dissertation ( approx . 600 pages ) about bill swartley 's therapeutic approach . raben describes in his dissertation the history , theory and practice of swartley 's maturation techniques , based on his own experiences during two workshops led by swartley in bavaria , germany , and london , england , around 1978 , and by citing ( in german translation ) various papers that he received from swartley , and commenting on them . the title of the dissertation is : william swartleys integrative primärtherapie ( `` primal integration `` ) . raben received his doctoral degree in 1984 at the psychological institute of the university of salzburg , austria . -- in the years 1978-1982 raben had had a post of `` wissenschaftlicher assistent `` ( scientific assistant ) at the institute for medical psychology and psychotherapy at the technical university ( tu ) of munich , led by the psychoanalyst and psychotherapist prof. dr. med . et phil . albert görres ( see wikipedia ) , who sympathized with arthur janov 's primal therapy und used primal techniques . raben 's job at the institute was to collect literature about the different `` cathartic therapies `` . this voluminous collection of literature ( including papers about swartley 's primal integration ) was around 1995 conferred into the archive of the institut für grenzgebiete der psychologie und psychohygiene ( igpp ) in freiburg im breisgau , southern germany . it is there available under the keyword `` sammlung dr. raben `` . ( see also raben 's homepage : johann-georg-raben.de ) – william swartley has , in 1954 , delivered a master 's thesis at the faculty of the american academy of asian studies , college of the pacific , in stockton , california . the title of the thesis is : the relation of the concept of the function of the analytical psychologist and the function of the `` guru `` or spiritual guide of hinduism . in this thesis , much about the psychology of carl gustav jung can be found .

mary celine fasenmyer ( october 4 , 1906 , crown , pennsylvania – december 27 , 1996 , erie , pennsylvania ) was an american mathematician . she is most noted for her work on hypergeometric functions and linear algebra .


== life ==
fasenmyer grew up in pennsylvania 's oil country , and displayed mathematical talent in high school . for ten years after her graduation she taught and studied at mercyhurst college in erie , where she joined the sisters of mercy . the religious sister pursued her mathematical studies in pittsburgh and the university of michigan , obtaining her doctorate in 1946 under the direction of earl rainville , with a dissertation entitled some generalized hypergeometric polynomials.after earning her ph.d. , fasenmyer published two papers which expanded on her doctorate work . these would be further elaborated by doron zeilberger and herbert wilf into `` wz theory `` , which allowed computerized proof of many combinatorial identities . after this , she returned to mercyhurst to teach and did not engage in further research .


== `` sister celine 's `` method ==
fasenmyer is most remembered for the method that bears her name , first described in her ph.d. thesis concerning recurrence relations in hypergeometric series . the thesis demonstrated a purely algorithmic method to find recurrence relations satisfied by sums of terms of a hypergeometric polynomial , and requires only the series expansions of the polynomial . the beauty of her method is that it lends itself readily to computer automation . the work of wilf and zeilberger generalized the algorithm and established its correctness .
the hypergeometric polynomials she studied are called sister celine 's polynomials .

= arthur f. bentley =
arthur fisher bentley ( october 16 , 1870 in freeport , illinois – may 21 , 1957 in paoli , indiana ) was an american political scientist and philosopher who worked in the fields of epistemology , logic and linguistics and who contributed to the development of a behavioral methodology of political science .


== biography ==
he received his bachelor of arts in 1892 and his ph.d. in 1895 from johns hopkins university . he was the second person to win the american humanist association 's humanist of the year award , in 1954 . he moved to paoli , indiana in 1910 where he lived for the rest of his life .


== work ==
bentley held that interactions of groups are the basis of political life , and rejected statist abstractions . in his opinion , group activity determined legislation , administration and adjudication . these ideas of process-based behavioralism later became central to political science . his tenet that `` social movements are brought about by group interaction `` is a basic feature of contemporary pluralist and interest-group approaches .
his work the process of government , published in 1908 , had much influence on political science from the 1930s to the 1950s . although initially not of consequence , it influenced other groups such as the chicago school who also tried to develop objective , value-free analyses of the political field . this influence is still felt decades on ( 1983 : institut d'etudes politiques de grenoble , mémoire `` décision groupale et réalité démocratique dans the process of government `` , p. chabal ) .
his paper `` the human skin : philosophy 's last line of defense `` ( 1941 ) was published in philosophy of science 8 ( 1941 ) : 1-19 .
and is available from the mead project at brock university in 1949 , he co-authored knowing and the known , a series of papers on epistemology , with john dewey .

granville penn ( 9 december 1761 – 28 september 1844 ) was a great-grandson of admiral sir william penn , a british author , and scriptural geologist .


== biography ==
he was born 9 december 1761 in spring gardens , london , the second surviving son of thomas penn and his wife , lady juliana fermor penn , fourth daughter of thomas , first earl of pomfret . he studied at magdalen college , oxford , but did not complete his degree . he then became an assistant clerk in the war department .
in the period from 1788 penn played a part in the development of veterinary education . a supporter of the odiham society , he met charles benoît vial de sainbel who was in england for the second time to try to set up a veterinary school , such as existed at lyon ; and whose profile was raised when he was asked to dissect the famous racehorse eclipse . penn ran a successful campaign over a few years to implement his own version of sainbel 's original scheme . the veterinary college , london opened its doors to pupils at the beginning of 1792.in 1834 penn succeeded his brother , john penn , in the estates of stoke park , buckinghamshire , and pennsylvania castle , portland.he died at stoke park on 28 september 1844 . he had married isabella , the eldest daughter of general gordon forbes and had 4 sons and 5 daughters .


== writings ==
penn , fluent in french , greek , latin and hebrew , was a fellow of the society of antiquaries and wrote several books dealing with biblical criticism and published a number of competent translations of ancient greek works , including a critical revision of the english version of the new testament . he also wrote some theological works particularly related to biblical chronology ( past and future ) and the early history of post-flood mankind . in 1833 he wrote the life of admiral sir william penn , on his great-grandfather .


=== a comparative estimate ===
his major work as a scriptural geologist was a comparative estimate of the mineral and mosaical geologies , published in 1822 . penn added a supplement in 1823 in response to buckland 's theory on kirkdale cave , and then revised and enlarged it to two volumes in 1825 in response to criticisms . like most scriptural geologists , penn , whose name became indelibly associated with scriptural geology , participated only transiently with it during his career . for example , between the production of his book when he was 62 and his death in 1844 he focused on philological scholarship .


==== attitude toward geology ====
penn wrote that `` the science of geology … has this remarkable character above all the preceding physical sciences ; that , it not only conducts the intelligence , like them , to the discernment of the god of nature , but advances it further , to a distinct recognition of that god of nature in the god of scripture . ``

elkan nathan adler ( 24 july 1861 in st luke 's , london – 15 september 1946 in london ) was an english author , lawyer , historian , and collector of jewish books and manuscripts . adler 's father was nathan marcus adler , chief rabbi of the british empire . he traveled extensively and built an enormous library , particularly of old jewish documents . adler was among the first to explore the documents stored in the cairo genizah , being in fact the first european to enter it . during his visits to cairo in 1888 and 1895 adler collected and brought over 25,000 genizah manuscript fragments back to england .
adler was particularly interested in the history of persian ( iranian ) jews . he traveled to tehran and bukhara in 1896 and 1897 , where he purchased various hebrew and judeo-persian manuscripts and later published descriptive lists of their contents . these publications provided western scholars with critical insight into the cultural , literary , and intellectual endeavors pursued by the jews of iran . the manuscripts collected by adler include both religious and secular works on various topics , including stories , folklore , calendars , biblical and talmudic dictionaries , prayer books , liturgical hymns , discourses on kabbalah ( jewish mysticism ) , and chronicles of religious persecution . in his 1921 summary , catalogue of hebrew manuscripts in the collection of e. n. adler , adler described over 4,500 manuscripts in his collection.overall , adler collected some 30,000 printed books in judaica . unfortunately for him , a business associate 's embezzlement forced him to sell most of his library to the jewish theological seminary of america in new york city and hebrew union college in cincinnati in 1923 . moreover , adler agreed to bequeath his subsequent acquisitions to the jewish theological seminary upon his death .
during a visit to egypt in 1924 , adler acquired a recently discovered jar that contained the private archive of an egyptian mercenary , horos son of nechoutes ( c. 145-88 bc ) , and he personally contributed to the edition of the documents which were published as the adler papyri .
adler published many books about his travels and on his extensive collections , including about hebrew manuscripts ( 1905 ) , a gazetteer of hebrew printing ( 1917 ) ; jews in many lands ( 1905 ) ; auto de fe and jew ( 1908 ) ; history of the jews of london ( 1930 ) ; jewish travellers ( 1930 , repr . 1966 ) ; and articles on the samaritans and on the history of the jews in egypt and persia . adler was extremely active in english-jewish communal affairs , especially in education , and was an ardent zionist ; he was an early member of the hovevei zion in england . per his will , his personal archives are now at the library of the jewish theological seminary of america .

== work ==
lifshitz is well known in the field of general relativity for coauthoring the bkl conjecture concerning the nature of a generic curvature singularity . as of 2006 , this is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in the subject of classical gravitation.with lev landau , lifshitz co-authored course of theoretical physics , an ambitious series of physics textbooks , in which the two aimed to provide a graduate-level introduction to the entire field of physics . these books are still considered invaluable and continue to be widely used .
lifshitz was the second of only 43 people ever to pass landau 's `` theoretical minimum `` examination . he made many invaluable contributions , in particular to quantum electrodynamics , where he calculated the casimir force in an arbitrary macroscopic configuration of metals and dielectrics .
a special multicritical point , the lifshitz point , carries , since 1975 , his name .

he is believed to have been the first pianist to play three concertos of ludwig van beethoven in a single concert : his performances of beethoven 's third , fourth and fifth with the new york symphony orchestra in the aeolian hall in 1919.he became a member of the faculty at the juilliard school , and successively dean ( 1926–1937 ) and president ( 1937–1945 ) of the school . at juilliard , he championed the use of radio musical broadcasts in education.he taught many first-rate students . one of these many students was mary ann craft , who later taught the prodigy edgar coleman during his formative years . two other students who went on to important pianistic careers were the american abram chasins , and the australian bruce hungerford . he also taught muriel kerr , a winner of the naumberg competition who made her carnegie hall debut 5 december 1928 in rachmaninoff 's concerto no . 2 with the philharmonic so of new york conducted by mengelberg . she became hutcheson 's assistant at juilliard and later toured under columbia artists management , settling finally in los angeles where she taught at the university of southern california . hutcheson was a member of the phi mu alpha sinfonia music fraternity .


== at chautauqua ==
hutcheson was also associated with the chautauqua school of music at the chautauqua institution in western new york state . hutcheson provided a much needed refuge for george gershwin at chautauqua during the stressful period of composing and refining the piano concerto in f. since gershwin was already very famous as a successful writer of popular works and musical shows , he was constantly besieged by admirers . further , he had never scored a large symphonic work ( the earlier rhapsody in blue had been scored for jazz band by gershwin , but was orchestrated by ferde grofé ) and was under great stress from the pressing deadline expectations from walter damrosch , conductor of the new york symphony , who had commissioned the concerto in f. thanks to ernest hutcheson 's kind offer of seclusion for gershwin at chautauqua where his quarters were declared off limits to everyone until 4 p.m. daily , gershwin was able to successfully complete his piano concerto on time .


== works ==
ernest hutcheson wrote concertos for piano ; 2 pianos ; and violin , and many solo piano works , such as a transcription of wagner 's ride of the valkyries . his music has been little heard in concert or on recordings , but his australian compatriot ian munro has recorded some of his piano pieces .
hutcheson wrote important books the literature of the piano , the elements of piano technique , , a musical guide to richard wagner 's ring of the nibelung , and elektra , by richard strauss : a guide to the opera with musical examples from the score , among others .

irving bieber was born in new york city and graduated from new york university medical college in 1930 . bieber went on to work at yale medical college , new york university , and starting in 1953 at the new york medical college , where he taught a course in psychoanalysis . bieber was , along with lionel ovesey and charles socarides , one of the most influential american psychoanalysts who attempted to convert gay men to heterosexuality . bieber 's 1962 book homosexuality : a psychoanalytic study of male homosexuals was a counter reaction to the 1948 kinsey report on male sexual behavior . it remained the leading study on homosexuality until homosexuality was removed from dsm-iii in 1973.in 1970 , bieber attended a meeting of the american psychiatric association in san francisco that was protested by gay activists . according to socarides , bieber , who felt he had `` been working all these years to help these people `` , `` took this very hard . `` in 1973 , the same year the american psychiatric association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders , bieber told an interviewer that `` a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled , like the legs of a polio victim . `` when alan p. bell , martin s. weinberg , and sue kiefer hammersmith 's study sexual preference was published in 1981 , bieber declared that its findings were `` totally disparate `` with his experience from psychiatric consultation.bieber arranged a partial translation into english of a paper by the hungarian pediatrician s. lindner , who had reported a systematic study of sucking . sigmund freud had used lindner 's observation that sensual sucking seems to absorb the attention completely and leads to either sleep or an orgasm-like response to develop his theory of infantile sexuality . bieber pointed out what he saw as inaccuracies in freud 's use of this paper.bieber died in manhattan in 1991 .

=== homosexuality : a psychoanalytic study of male homosexuals ===

homosexuality offered a view of homosexuality as an illness that has since been discredited . the book has been criticized for examining homosexuals already in analytic treatment as opposed to non-patient heterosexuals . it has been suggested that the study informed stereotypes later promulgated by the media . for example , in 1964 life magazine featured an article on homosexuals and smothering mothers directly inspired by this study . despite its discrediting , homosexuality continued to be read and taught in psychopathology courses in universities in the 1980s .

= august beer =
august beer ( german : [ beːɐ̯ ] ; 31 july 1825 – 18 november 1863 ) was a german physicist , chemist , and mathematician of jewish descent .


== biography ==
beer was born in trier , where he studied mathematics and natural sciences . beer was educated at the technical school and gymnasium of his native town until 1845 , when he went to bonn to study mathematics and the sciences under the mathematician and physicist julius plücker , whose assistant he became later . in 1848 he won the prize for his essay , `` de situ axium opticorum in crystallis biaxibus , `` and obtained the degree of ph.d. two years later he was appointed lecturer at the university of bonn .
in 1852 , beer published a paper on the absorption of red light in coloured aqueous solutions of various salts . beer makes use of the fact , derived from bouguer 's and lambert 's absorption laws , that the intensity of light transmitted through a solution at a given wavelength decreases exponentially with the path length d and the concentration c of the solute ( the solvent is considered non-absorbing ) . actually , the “ absorption coëfficient ” defined by beer in his paper is the transmittance ( or transmission ratio ) , t = i / i0 . thus , as pointed out by beer , the transmittance of a concentrated solution can be derived from a measurement of the transmittance of a dilute solution .
indeed , the transmittance measured for any concentration and path length can be normalized to the corresponding transmittance for a standard concentration and path length . beer in a number of experiments confirms this , defining a standard concentration of 10 % , and a standard path length of 10 cm . the photometer , devised by beer , is shown in the gallery below .
beer continued to publish the results of his scientific labors , writing in 1854 einleitung in die höhere optik ( introduction to the higher optics ) . his findings , together with those of johann heinrich lambert , make up the beer–lambert law . in 1855 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the university of bonn . beer also wrote `` einheit in der electrostatik , `` published two years after his death . he died in bonn in 1863 .


== beer 's law ==
beer 's law , also called lambert–beer law or beer–lambert law , in spectroscopy , is the physical law stating that the quantity of light absorbed by a substance dissolved in a nonabsorbing solvent is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance and the path length of the light through the solution . beer 's law is commonly written in the form a = ε cl , where a is the absorbance , c is the concentration in moles per liter , l is the path length in centimeters , and ε is a constant of proportionality known as the molar extinction coefficient . the law is accurate only for dilute solutions ; deviations from the law occur in concentrated solutions because of interactions between molecules of the solute , the substance dissolved in the solvent .

= boris sidis =
boris sidis ( ; october 12 , 1867 – october 24 , 1923 ) was a ukrainian-american psychologist , physician , psychiatrist , and philosopher of education . sidis founded the new york state psychopathic institute and the journal of abnormal psychology . he was the father of child prodigy william james sidis . boris sidis eventually opposed mainstream psychology and sigmund freud , and thereby died ostracized . he was married to a maternal aunt of clifton fadiman , the american intellectual .


== life and work ==
born in russian empire to jewish parents , [ 1 ] he emigrated to the u.s. in 1887 to escape political persecution . due to the may laws , he was imprisoned for at least two years , according to william james sidis ' biographer , amy wallace . he later credited his ability to think to this long solitary confinement . his wife , sarah mandelbaum sidis , m.d . , and her family fled the pogroms about 1889 .
boris completed four degrees at harvard ( a b.a . , m.a . , ph.d. and m.d . ) and studied under william james . he was influential in the early 20th century , known for pioneering work in psychopathology ( founding the new york state psychopathic institute and the journal of abnormal psychology ) , hypnoid/hypnotic states , and group psychology . he is also noted for vigorously applying the principles of evolutionary biology to the study of psychology .
he vehemently opposed world war i , viewing war as a social disease , and denigrated the widely held concept of eugenics . he sought to provide insight into why people behave as they do , particularly in cases of a mob frenzy or religious mania . with the publication of his book nervous ills : their cause and cure [ 2 ] in 1922 , he summarized much of his previous work in diagnosing , understanding and treating nervous disorders . he saw fear as an underlying cause of much human mental suffering and problematic behavior .
sidis applied his own psychological approaches to raising his son , william james sidis , in whom he wished to promote a high intellectual capacity . his son has been considered among the most intelligent people ever ( with a ratio iq broadly estimated at 250–300 , though this claim has been contested ) . after receiving much publicity for his childhood feats , he came to live an eccentric life , and died in relative obscurity . boris sidis himself derided intelligence testing as `` silly , pedantic , absurd , and grossly misleading . `` with boris ' fulminations against mainstream psychology and sigmund freud , he died ostracized by the community he had helped create .

hans walter kosterlitz frs ( 27 april 1903 – 26 october 1996 ) was a german-born british biologist ..


== biography ==
kosterlitz earned a doctor of medicine ( dr. med ) at humboldt university of berlin . he emigrated to scotland in 1934 , after the nazi takeover in germany led to antisemitic legislation that barred him from his job at charité in berlin . the affair shocked him and he fled to the uk , and after obtaining work in the uk , he was able to obtain safe-haven for his mother , brother , and fiancée hanna . he joined the staff of university of aberdeen in the same year , as an assistant in the physiology department . over the years he was a carnegie teaching fellow , lecturer , senior lecturer , and finally reader . in 1968 , aberdeen established a new department of pharmacology , which was headed by kosterlitz as professor until 1973 , when he became director of the university 's drug addiction research unit.kosterlitz is best known for his work as one of the key discoverers of endorphins . he stimulated the mouse isolated vas deferens electrically and recorded its contractions with a polygraph . he then found that if you added opiates to the solution , the muscle would not contract . opiates inhibited the contraction . those contractions were later found to resume in the presence of both opiates and an antagonist such as naloxone . later , endogenous endorphins were discovered by applying pig brain cell homegenate to the apparatus . this caused the contractions to cease . the degree to which an opiate agonist inhibits contractions of the mouse vas deferens , and other tissues like the guinea pig ileum , is highly correlated to its potency as an analgesic .
kosterlitz was given the scheele award in 1977 , and shared the albert lasker award with john hughes and solomon h. snyder in 1978 for his work in the discovery of the opiate receptors and their natural ligands . the kosterlitz centre at the university of aberdeen , opened on 16 september 2010 , is named in his honour .
hans kosterlitz was married , since 1937 , to hanna greßhöner . their son , j. michael , is professor of physics at brown university , who won the nobel prize in physics in 2016

= cheves perky =
mary cheves west perky ( 1874–1940 ) was an american psychologist who studied under edward b. titchener at cornell university . in 1910 , she performed the `` banana experiment , `` which led to the discovery of the perky effect . the perky effect examines the link between mental imagery and visual perception.perky also studied the cooperative movement , and became the associate secretary of the cooperative league of america .


== the perky effect ==
perky ’ s famous experiments demonstrated how sensory input , or perceptions , can be mistaken for a mental image when perceptual processes and mental imagery interfere with each other . the perky effect describes when visual perception is altered by mental imagery . perky projected various images such as oranges and bananas on the wall of her lab . the images were projected at a very low brightness to start and gradually increased in brightness . the participants were asked to describe the objects that corresponded to the image that was being projected . following this procedure , participants stated they believed they were imagining the projected images rather than actually perceiving them . participants in perky ’ s study reported “ seeing ” greater detail in mental images than what was actually presented in the stimulus . imagery can be derived from short and long term memories . perky also distinguished between `` images of memory `` and `` images of imagination `` . images of memory are personal episodic images and are associated with more eye movements and feelings of familiarity . images of imagination are more general , have little meaning to an individual , and may be associated with feelings of surprise . the perky effect has been a foundation for research in visual perception and imagery . her studies have inspired replications and further exploration of different ways perception and imagery can affect things like visual acuity .

henry william menard ( december 10 , 1920 – february 9 , 1986 ) was an american geologist .


== life and career ==
he earned a b.s . and m.s . from the california institute of technology in 1942 and 1947 , having served in the south pacific during world war ii as a photo interpreter . in 1949 , he completed a ph.d. in marine geology at harvard university . menard is perhaps best known for his promotion of the theory of plate tectonics before it was widely accepted in the scientific community . menard served many roles during his career as a marine geologist . field worker , theorist , educator , popularizer , entrepreneur and statesman .
menard 's historical and sociological writings are respected by historians of science . menard began his professional career in 1949 , in the sea floor studies section of san diego 's navy electronics laboratory . he joined the scripps institution of oceanography ( sio ) in 1955 as associate professor of geology . menard 's field work was extensive , involving 1,000 aqua-lung dives and 20 oceanographic expeditions from 1949 until 1978 when he became director of the u.s.g.s . his research focused on the morphology of the ocean floor . during the 1950s , menard also started a scuba-diving business with a few colleagues that included consulting for at & t on the laying of cable .
he became a full professor of the university of california , san diego in 1961 . two years were spent at
churchill college ( 1962 and 1970-71 ) . following a year in washington , d.c. as technical advisor in the office of science and technology ( 1965-66 ) , menard served as director of the university of california 's institute of marine resources .


=== usgs career ===
in april 1978 , h. william menard became the united states geological survey 's tenth director but remained only through the balance of the carter administration . menard had been a marine geologist with the naval electronics laboratory in san diego for several years and then had become a member of the faculty of the scripps institution of oceanography . in 1965-66 , he was associated with the office of science and technology in the white house . a member of the national academy of sciences , menard was a recognized worldwide authority in marine geology and oceanography and had discovered notable topographic and structural features of the sea floor that laid much of the foundation of the plate-tectonics revolution in geology.after his return to the scripps institution of oceanography in 1981 , menard continued to teach , write , and do research . menard died from cancer on february 9 , 1986 . a biographical memoir was published by the national academy of sciences in 1994 .

= ren c3 a9 jeannel =
rené jeannel ( 23 march 1879 – 20 february 1965 ) was a french entomologist . he was director of the muséum national d'histoire naturelle from 1945 to 1951 . jeannel 's most important work was on the insect fauna of caves in the pyrenees , france and in the carpathians , romania . he also worked in africa . jeannel specialised in leiodidae ( then silphidae or catopidae ) but authored a large number of papers and works on other coleoptera . he was a member of the romanian academy .
as the son of a medical officer in the french military , jeannel was expected to succeed his father . however , after developing an interest , during his studies in toulouse , in cave exploration and especially cave fauna , he began considering a career in biological science instead . his interest was especially stimulated when he discovered two new cave beetles in the grotte d ’ oxibar ( named after him by abeille de perrin : bathyscia jeanneli and aphaenops jeanneli.in 1905 he began a life-long friendship and collaboration with romanian biologist emile racovitza . in the first 17 years alone they jointly explored 1,400 caves in southern europe and north africa and published descriptions of the caves and their fauna . when racovitza was invited to found a biospeleological institute in cluj , jeannel became his deputy director until 1927 , when jeannel obtained a chair in entomology in the paris museum.despite his administrative positions , jeannel remained a productive scientist . in 1911 , when he published his 641-page , 657-illustration doctoral thesis on leptodirini ( then called bathysciinae ) , he had already produced more than 30 papers . during the rest of his career , he added another 500 scientific publications to this total , together amounting to more than 20,000 published pages—mostly on cave insects and all illustrated by himself.jeannel 's most important contribution to taxonomy was the fact that he realised the potential of using the genitalia for species identification and classification . genitalia evolve faster than external parts of the body and therefore the differences between species are greater . in his book l ’ édéage ( 1955 ) , he summarized all the insights the study of the aedeagus ( the term used for the male beetle genital apparatus ) had afforded him .

== life ==
gabriel lalemant was born in paris , october 31 , 1610 , the son of a french jurist and his wife . he was the third of six children , five of whom entered religious life . two of gabriel 's uncles served the jesuits in new france : charles lalemant as the first superior of the jesuit missions in canada , and jérôme lalemant as the vicar-general of quebec.in 1630 lalemant joined the jesuits , and in 1632 he took the vow to devote himself to foreign missions . he taught at the collège in moulins from 1632 to 1635 . he was at bourges from 1635 to 1639 studying theology and was ordained there in 1638 . he taught at three different schools , being professor of philosophy at moulins . his repeated requests to go to new france were declined by his superiors , partly because of his poor health . eventually , his uncle jérôme , head of the canadian mission , intervened on his behalf.in september 1646 gabriel arrived in quebec , where he spent the first few months studying the huron language and customs . father bressani , a fellow missionary in new france , referred to him as a man of extremely frail constitution . for the first two years gabriel worked in and around quebec and the trading center of trois rivières ( three rivers ) . in september 1648 he was sent to wendake , the land of the wyandot ( huron ) , as an assistant to father jean de brébeuf , and posted to the mission at sainte-marie among the hurons . in february 1649 he replaced noël chabanel at the mission of saint louis .
in march 1649 , while most of the huron warriors were away , 1,200 iroquois attacked the settlement of saint ignace . a few survivors escaped to warn the village of st. louis . its eighty warriors fought to delay the attackers , trying to enable the elderly , women , and children to flee . lalemant and brébeuf remained with the warriors and were captured and taken to the nearby mission at saint ignace . both were tortured before being killed : jean brebeuf died on march 16 , 1649 , and gabriel lalemant died on march 17 , 1649.after the withdrawal of the iroquois war party from the area on march 19 , seven frenchmen went to st. ignace to retrieve the bodies of the jesuits and huron . they returned them to sainte-marie where they were buried . their relics are now housed at the martyrs ' shrine in midland , ontario .
lalemant was canonized by pope pius xi on june 29 , 1930.his surname may be spelled either lallemant or lalemant by different references .

== life and career ==
henry ford , from cranbrook in kent , joined the university of oxford on 9 july 1776 , at the age of 23 , matriculating as a member of pembroke college . he later became a member of christ church and obtained his bachelor of arts degree in 1780 . he was appointed lord almoner 's professor of arabic straight after obtaining his degree . he was not the only candidate : william jones , a lawyer and linguist , also applied . he had a reputation as a radical , and although ford was `` a comparative nonentity `` ( in the words of jones 's biographer ) , he had the advantage of having married the niece of a bishop , and so `` nepotism and politics triumphed `` .ford obtained his master of arts degree in 1783 . when matthew lamb , the principal of magdalen hall , resigned in 1788 , ford was his successor . he obtained a doctorate in civil law in the same year : it was customary at the time for the heads of colleges and halls to have a doctoral degree . he then `` retired as much as he could from the public view `` , wrote one historian of hertford college ( a successor institution to magdalen hall ) , adding that `` it was his excessive shyness that gained for him a certain notoriety and a place among the early oxford caricatures . `` in addition to his oxford positions , he was also an ordained priest in the church of england . he was a residentiary canon of hereford cathedral , rector of cradley and vicar of woolhope and fownhope in herefordshire . these were positions given to him by his wife 's uncle , john butler , the bishop of hereford . after butler 's death in 1802 , ford ( who was the bishop 's executor ) arranged for a memorial tablet to be placed in the cathedral.ford died on 26 july 1813 , and was buried in hereford cathedral ; a memorial to him was placed in the cloisters . he was succeeded in his positions as lord almoner 's professor and principal of magdalen hall by john macbride . alumni oxonienses , a 19th-century register of students and academics at the university , records that ford had two sons , charles and frederick , who both studied at oxford . he and his wife , mary , also had a daughter , anna louisa . mary died on 18 december 1831 `` in her 80th year `` .an obituary in the gentleman 's magazine praised ford 's `` great and varied acquirements in general science `` , his `` profound knowledge of oriental literature `` and his `` unaffected piety , gentleness , and benevolence . `` it also described him as `` an affectionate husband and tender father . ``

= philipp scharwenka =
ludwig philipp scharwenka ( 16 february 1847 , samter , grand duchy of posen – 16 july 1917 , bad nauheim ) was a german composer and teacher of music . he was the older brother of xaver scharwenka .


== early training ==
he was born in samter , grand duchy of posen . like his younger brother xaver he received his first intermittent musical instruction in posen . after the closure of the gymnasium ( college ) in 1865 he studied music theory together with his brother under richard wüerst and heinrich dorn at the new musical academy in berlin where , from 1868 , he himself was taken on as teacher of theory and composition . in this period his own first compositions appeared . in 1874 he brought out an overture and a symphony for the first time in a concert of his own .


== compositions ==
his many teaching obligations notwithstanding , philipp scharwenka stood in the front line as a composer and was recognised as such during his lifetime . his compositions include three symphonies , symphonic poems , a violin concerto , some choral works ( of which sakuntala became very famous ) , the 4-act opera roland , as well as numerous instrumental works such as sonatas , quartets , caprices and dances . many of the major conductors of the period , including arthur nikisch , anton seidl and hans richter , performed his orchestral works . he is still known for his chamber works , including two piano trios , two trios for violin , viola , and piano , two violin sonatas , one viola sonata , one cello sonata , two string quartets , and one piano quintet.in contrast to his brother 's very extroverted compositions , philipp 's many-sided works have dreamlike and thoroughly moody inflections . his best-liked works are the chamber works beginning in 1896 , which maintain traditional formal models and show considerable variety of melodic and rhythmical invention . in them scharwenka achieved ( despite the conservative restraints of the time in which he was writing ) through very refined compositional techniques , something approaching an impressionistic tonal palette . these works found such distinguished interpreters as willy burmester , julius klengel and moritz meyer-mahr .
one of his admirers was max reger , who in 1898 dedicated his phantasiestücke op . 26 to him . in the context of the 37th composer-congress in 1900 , his dramatic fantasy for orchestra op 108 , being crowned with a prize by the national german music-society , was performed in bremen .


== conservatory director ==
at the opening of the scharwenka-conservatory in berlin , his brother xaver entrusted to him in 1881 the direction of the theory and composition teaching , and then in 1891 that of the sister-conservatory in new york . philipp however returned to berlin in 1892 to take control of the conservatory there , which in 1893 he merged with the piano school of karl klindworth to form the klindworth-scharwenka conservatory . this went on to become an outstanding institution in the musical landscape of berlin . as director of the conservatory , scharwenka remained active until his death in 1917 . otto klemperer studied with him in berlin , and oskar fried was another very distinguished pupil of his . see : list of music students by teacher : r to s # philipp scharwenka .


== other ==
in 1880 philipp married violin virtuoso marianne scharwenka ( marianne stresow , d. 1918 ) . in 1937 his son walter scharwenka took over as director at the conservatory .
also scharwenka possessed a remarkable talent as graphic illustrator , which is seen , for instance , in the drastic-humorous figures for alexander moszkowski 's satire , anton notenquetscher .

frederick ernest joseph fry mbe , frsc ( april 17 , 1908 – may 22 , 1989 ) was a canadian ichthyologist and aquatic ecologist . he is known for his early research in physiological ecology and population dynamics in fishes . in the late 1940s , he became the first scientist to model how environmental factors affect the activity of fish . he was a 1959 guggenheim fellow , and served as president of several organizations including the american society of limnology and oceanography ( 1951 ) american fisheries society ( 1966 ) and american institute of fishery research biologists ( 1972 ) .
fry was born in the english town of woking , surrey , april 17 , 1908 , to parents ernest and mabel fry . his family immigrated to canada in 1912 , and after the first world war settled in toronto . fry attended the university of toronto , earning a b.a . ( 1933 ) , m.a . ( 1935 ) , and phd ( 1936 ) . he joined the university of toronto faculty as lecturer in 1938 .
during world war ii fry served in the royal canadian air force from 1941 to 1945 , working in aviation medicine , where he helped develop equipment aiding in respiration at high altitudes.after the war , fry returned to the university of toronto as assistant professor in 1945 , and became full professor of zoology in 1956 , a position he held until his retirement in 1973 .
one of his early studies of note was a long term field study of fishes of lake opeongo in algonquin provincial park . in an influential 1949 paper , fry developed `` virtual population `` analysis to understand effects of fishing on fish populations , a method which 50 years later was still in a chief way of determining total allowable catches in fisheries management.his physiology papers `` effects of the environment on animal physiology `` in 1947 , and `` the aquatic respiration of fish `` in 1957 have become classic works in fisheries science .

russell shoemaker ohl ( january 30 , 1898 – march 20 , 1987 ) was an american engineer who is generally recognized for patenting the modern solar cell ( us patent 2402662 , `` light sensitive device `` ) .
ohl was a notable semiconductor researcher prior to the invention of the transistor . he was also known as r.s . ohl .
russell ohl ’ s specialized area of research was into the behavior of certain types of crystals . he worked on materials research in the 1930s at at & t 's bell labs ’ holmdel facility , investigating diode detectors suitable for high-frequency wireless , broadcasting , and military radar . his work was only understood by a handful of scientists in the organization , one of whom was dr. walter brattain ( one of the trio who invented the germanium bipolar transistor in 1947 , and who would be awarded the nobel prize for physics in 1956 ) .
ohl , in 1939 , discovered the pn barrier ( or as it became known , the “ p–n junction ” ) . at the time hardly anyone knew anything about the impurities within these crystals , but russell ohl discovered the mechanism by which it worked . it was the impurities which made some sections more resistant to electrical flow than others , and thus it was the `` barrier `` between these areas of different purity that made the crystal work . ohl later found that super-purifying germanium was the key to making repeatable and usable semiconductor material for diodes . all diodes ( incl . leds , laser diodes etc . ) are descendants of ohl 's work . his work with diodes led him later to develop the first silicon solar cells .

kenneth a. harrison ( 1901 – november 5 , 1991 ) was a canadian mycologist . he was for many years a plant pathologist at what is now the atlantic food and horticulture research centre in nova scotia . after retirement , he contributed to the taxonomy of the agaricomycotina , particularly the tooth fungi of the families hydnaceae and bankeraceae , in which he described several new species .


== early life and career ==
originally from new brunswick , harrison graduated from nova scotia agricultural college in 1922 , and , in 1924 , from the ontario agricultural college with a b.sc . in agriculture . he earned an msc in plant pathology from macdonald campus of mcgill university a year later . a doctoral degree he started at the university of toronto in 1929 was abandoned due to the great depression . he established a herbarium of mycological specimens where he was employed for many years at the kentville research station ( now the atlantic food and horticulture research centre ) ; most of his collections are now housed at the canadian national mycological herbarium . his early research concerned the fungal infestation of plants , such as that of colletotrichum lindemuthianum on beans ( phaseolus ) . working with john frederick dewitt hockey , they made many contributions to the control and prevention of diseases of horticultural crops . they were among the first to use the sticky slide spore trap to estimate the densities of fungal spores .


== post-retirement activities ==
after his retirement in 1966 , harrison began studying the mushroom-producing species of the agaricomycotina more avidly . collections forays throughout nova scotia , in the great smoky mountains , new mexico , the upper peninsula of michigan , and the pacific northwest led to him describing several new species in the genera steccherinum , and tooth fungi in hydnellum , sarcodon , phellodon . harrison died in kentville , nova scotia , in 1991 . the department of biology at acadia university has a mycology laboratory named in his honour .


== eponymous species ==
the tooth fungus sarcodon harrisonii was named in his honor by richard baird , who noted `` dr. kenneth harrison the north american expert on the stipitate hydnums . from his publications , professional and amateur mycologists can more easily identify the taxa of the group `` . other fungi named after harrison include :

== life ==

the son of john theodore koster , of liverpool , a sugar merchant , koster was born in portugal . in 1809 he was sent to pernambuco because it was thought to be the way to improve his poor health . he sailed from liverpool in a ship called lucy on 2 november 1809 , travelling with a family friend , and arrived in recife , brazil , on 7 december . he spent a year at recife before beginning a programme of travels around the country . in 1812 he rented an estate at jaguaribe , where he slept in a hammock in an unfinished church until he could get possession of the big house , bought slaves , and established himself as a fazendeiro , growing and exporting coffee . koster spent the rest of his life in brazil , except for short visits to england . while in brazil , he pursued a particular study of the institution of slavery there , travelling widely , and began to write books about his experiences that were published in london . his works are considered the most detailed accounts of north-east brazil written in english in his period.koster was a friend of the poet robert southey , who encouraged him to write his travels in brazil ( 1816 ) , which was dedicated to southey `` in memorial of affectionate respect and gratitude `` . he began but did not finish a translation into portuguese of southey 's multi-volume history of brazil ( 1810–1819 ) . southey mentions the sad loss of his young friend koster in his sir thomas marc ( 1831 ) .he died in pernambuco on 15 may 1820 . a report of the death in the gentleman 's magazine said he was `` in his 27th year `` .

carl troll ( 24 december 1899 in gabersee – 21 july 1975 in bonn ) , was a german geographer , brother of botanist wilhelm troll . from 1919 until 1922 troll studied biology , chemistry , geology , geography and physics at the universität in münchen . in 1921 he obtained his doctorate in botany and in 1925 his habilitation in geography . between 1922 and 1927 he worked as an assistant at the geography institute in munich . troll was engaged in research in the ecology and geography of mountainous lands : between 1926 and 1929 went on a research journey throughout south american andean countries where he visited northern chile , bolivia , peru , ecuador , colombia , and panama . in 1933 and 1934 his research interests took him to east and south africa ; in 1937 troll was in ethiopia ; and in 1954 he visited mexico .
in 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in berlin , and in 1938 professor of geography in bonn . troll , who utilised aerial photographs in his research , coined the term landscape ecology in 1939 . he developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying aerial photographs interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of asia , africa and south america , as well as his native europe . he developed seasonal climatic charts and three-dimensional climatic classification from hydrological , biological and economical data .
carl troll was president of the international geographical union from 1960 to 1964


== andean research ==
compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century troll 's andean work stands out by being free of developmentalist thought and there is `` no evidence of triumphalism of western science in his andean work `` . vertical zonation is the most acclaimed part of trolls work in the andes building upon the work of alexander von humboldt .


=== the inca empire and the environment ===
carl troll argued that the development of the inca state in the central andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the staple food chuño . chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern peruvian highlands . contradicting the link between the inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun . troll did also argue that llamas , the inca 's pack animal , can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region . it is worth considering the maximum extent of the inca empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas in pre-hispanic america . the link between the andean biomes of puna and páramo , pastoralism and the inca state is a matter of research . as a third point troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the inca state-building . while troll theorized environmental influences on the inca empire he opposed environmental determinism arguing that culture lied at the core of the inca civilization .

mcivor was born in dollar in scotland where his father john had settled after working to establish a nursery garden at crieff . mcivor trained in horticulture and arboriculture and worked at kew before taking up in 1848 , a position in southern india as superintendent of the yet to be established ootacamund botanical garden . at kew , mcivor took an interest in bryophytes and published a pocket herbarium of british hepatics in 1847 . he established the botanical garden at ootacamund and worked there until his death . he married anne , eldest daughter of colonel edwards of iscoed , denbighshire on 31 may 1850 . mcivor received cinchona plants in 1861 that had been brought from south america by clements markham . the first set of plants died but later batches consisting of other species ( especially cinchona succirubra ) did well . mcivor found that removing strips of barks and allowing them to heal by covering them in moss improved the sustainability of harvesting bark from the trees.mcivor ran into troubles with the madras government on handling a subordinate who was given to drinking . he also faced labour shortages which were for a while solved by importing chinese convicts from the straits settlements . the labour situation eased in 1877 due to the famine in the plains and an influx into the niligiris .

his funeral was attended by most government officers and among those present included colonel r. h. beddome.the standard author abbreviation mcivor is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

in a series of influential papers coauthored with stanley engerman , sokoloff studied the impact of countries ' initial factor endowments on their later political and economic development . while much of the contemporary literature explained different growth rates across countries by appealing to differences in national culture or religion , sokoloff used historical data to claim that much of the differential growth experiences of the us colonies and of new world countries can be explained through differences in initial endowments of factors including human capital and levels of inequality . moreover , sokoloff and engerman theorized that initial levels of wealth and political power inequality led to the development of institutions that perpetuated these inequalities , furthering their deleterious impact on long run economic growth . in article `` institutions , factors endowments , and paths of development in the new world `` , sokoloff and engerman made the specific hypothesis about inequality in wealth , human capital , and political power that restrict development of economics and compose the united states and canada have developed very different . for example , grains , which is grown on small family farms in the u.s. and canada that lead the distributions of wealth more equal ; whereas , other colonies in the new world relied on slaves for their labor force that lead to distributions of wealth , human capital and political power very unequal between black ( slaves ) and white . in addition to wealth and political power inequality , they have also mentioned the inequality of schooling in latin american countries . all of the latin american countries had literacy requirement for voting . however , the government did not provide funds for public education that caused the latin americans to have a low literacy level , in which affected the voting rate . therefore , a weak organizing schooling institution could affect the development of economy .
sokoloff and his coauthors also sought to understand the relationship between economic institutions and technological innovation . in particular , sokoloff stressed the importance of us patent institutions in fostering innovation by entrepreneurs . for instance , with zorina khan , sokoloff examined the careers of 160 `` great inventors `` credited with significant technological discoveries during the early american industrialization . in contrast to previous findings , sokoloff and khan found that these inventors were active entrepreneurs who responded systematically to market incentives . on the other hand , sokoloff , with naomi lamoreaux , found that over time the capital requirements associated with invention became prohibitively high , leading to firms taking over much of the innovative activity that was previously undertaken by individual entrepreneurs .

louis antoine françois baillon ( 20 january 1778 – 3 december 1855 ) was a french naturalist and collector . he was born in montreuil-sur-mer and died in abbeville .
his father , jean-françois-emmanuel baillon ( 1742-1801 ) , a lawyer and correspondent of the muséum national d'histoire naturelle , introduced him to natural history . in 1798 , baillon began work at as an assistant at the jardin des plantes , a position he relinquished following the death of his father . afterwards , he settled in abbeville , and like his father , became known for his correspondence with famed naturalists . in his studies , the younger baillon maintained correspondence with franco andrea bonelli , étienne geoffroy saint-hilaire and prince maximilian of wied-neuwied.during his career , he continued and developed an ornithological collection that was initiated by his father , a collection that eventually grew to 6000 items . baillon 's collection ( birds only ) is now conserved in `` musée george sand et de la vallée noire `` in la châtre . in addition to birds from france , it contains exotic specimens from french voyages of exploration , notably birds from the expeditions of jacques labillardière and jules dumont d'urville.the single publication of laf baillon is the catalogue des mammifères , oiseaux , reptiles , poissons et mollusques testacés marins , observés dans l'arrondissement d'abbeville.baillon 's crake is named for him , as is baillon 's shearwater and baillonius bailloni ( saffron toucanet ) .

= carl niemann =
carl george niemann ( july 6 , 1908 – april 29 , 1964 ) was an american biochemist who worked extensively on the chemistry and structure of proteins , publishing over 260 research papers . he is known , with max bergmann , for proposing the bergmann-niemann hypothesis that proteins consist of 288 residue polypeptides or multiples thereof with periodic sequences of amino acids , and for contributing to the downfall of the cyclol model of protein structure.niemann was born in st. louis and attended the university of wisconsin–madison . after completing his ph.d. in biochemistry there in 1934 and staying on as research associate until 1935 , niemann took a position at the rockefeller institute for medical research , where he worked with the eminent protein chemist max bergmann . niemann analyzed the amino acid content of range of proteins . based on niemann 's tests and other published protein analyses , bergmann and niemann deduced that the sizes of protein molecules are always multiples of 288 and could be expressed according to the formula 2n x 3m . they also suggested that in the polypeptides of a given protein , amino acids occurred in a regular , repeating pattern ; for example , they proposed that silk fibroin , known to consist mainly of glycine and alanine , had a sequence of glycine-alanine-glycine- [ other ] , with the glycine/alanine pattern making up three of every four amino acids and other residues falling periodically into the fourth spot . niemann worked with bergmann on this theory from 1936–1938 ; by 1939 , they came to reject the theory as other biochemists provided evidence contradicting their proposed formula.after his work at the rockefeller institute and at the university college hospital as a rockefeller foundation fellow , and with strong support from warren weaver , niemann joined linus pauling 's crellin laboratory at caltech in 1938 . in 1939 , niemann and linus pauling published a strong critique of dorothy wrinch 's cyclol hypothesis of protein structure , which held that globular proteins formed inter-linked , cage-like polyhedral structures . niemann and pauling argued that x-ray crystallography and other data indicated that cyclol bonds did not occur in proteins and that polypeptides were held together in globular proteins by hydrogen bonds and weaker intermolecular forces . he went on to head research in immunochemistry and the organic chemistry of proteins.in 1945 , niemann became of full professor at caltech . he was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1952 , and was also elected to the american academy of arts and sciences and the new york academy of sciences . he died of a heart attack , according to his eulogizer john d. roberts , `` at the very height of his career `` .

= paul petter waldenstr c3 b6m =
paul petter waldenström ( alternately spelled `` paul peter `` ) ( 20 july 1838 – 14 july 1917 ) was a swedish theologian who became the most prominent leader of the free church movement in late 19th century sweden .
waldenström was born in luleå in northern sweden , son of a district physician . he began his academic studies at uppsala university in 1857 , completed his ph.d. degree there in 1863 , and was ordained a priest in 1864 . he had been employed as an adjunct in the växjö högre allmänna läroverk ( the secondary school in växjö ) already in 1862 and in 1864 , when his doctorate qualified him for this , received a lecturership in christianity , greek and hebrew at the secondary school in umeå . from 1874 until 1905 he was lecturer in the same subjects at the secondary school in gävle . he was awarded a doctor of theology degree from yale university in 1889 and was awarded the laurel for a second time as a jubeldoktor ( `` jubilee doctor `` ) in uppsala in 1913 .


== work in the free church movement ==
although he worked as a school teacher his whole life , waldenström 's notability comes from his work as a theologian , editor of christian periodicals , and a preacher . he was long a leading member of the swedish evangelical mission ( evangeliska fosterlandsstiftelsen ) , a movement within the state church , but was among those who left the organization in 1878 to form the swedish mission covenant ( svenska missionsförbundet , since 2003 the mission covenant church of sweden , the svenska missionskyrkan ) , which long had an ambivalent relationship to the state church , torn between the relative moderation of waldenström and the greater radicalism of the first president erik jakob ekman ( 1842–1915 ) and his followers . after ekman 's resignation in 1904 , waldenström became the president of the society . in 1868 he began editing pietisten ( `` the pietist `` ) , which was a publication associated with the free church movement . this proved to be very influential both in sweden and abroad ; in america , the evangelical covenant church was greatly influenced by his life and writings .


== theological contributions ==
waldenström 's influence can be partially summed up in the maxim often associated with his movement : `` where does it stand written ? `` ( swedish : var står det skrivet ? ) . this cry reflects his passion for the bible . the fact that waldenström spent 11 years translating the new testament from greek to swedish shows his devotion to the holy texts . his influence is not limited to translation and exegesis . he led an active political life and wrote on a variety of theological topics .
he wrote a book titled `` baptism and infant baptism `` ( swedish : dop och barndop ) . but perhaps his greatest legacy is his understanding of justification and atonement . he rejected that the prevailing notion that god 's wrath was satisfied by the cross because it made god the object of reconciliation and lacked scriptural support . he instead asserted that humanity , not god , was the object of the atonement ; that god was the initiator , not the recipient , of the work of reconciliation in christ .

alfred einhorn born alfred finkle ( 27 february 1856 – 21 march 1917 ) was a jewish german chemist most notable for first synthesizing procaine in 1905 which he patented under the name novocain . until that time the primary anesthetic in use was cocaine , however its undesirable side effects ( including toxicity and addiction ) led scientists to seek out newer anesthetic drugs .
novocain was found to be comparatively safe and effective , although its anesthetic effects were weaker than cocaine and some patients proved highly allergic . however , none of the other anesthetics developed during this period proved more effective and novocain quickly became the standard local anesthesia . although its use has largely been replaced by lidocaine , it is still in use today , most frequently in dentistry .


== life ==
einhorn , aka finkle , was born in hamburg , and due to the death of his parents his education took place in leipzig with his relatives . he studied chemistry at the university of leipzig and later at the university of tübingen where he received his ph.d. for his work on ketones in 1878 . he joined the group of adolf von baeyer at the university of munich in 1882 , left two times for his habilitation to the university of darmstadt and to the university of aachen , but came back to munich permanently in 1891 . he was professor at the university of munich until his death in 1917 .

== education and career ==
davis received his ph.d. from harvard university and taught at smith college , clark university , pennsylvania state university , princeton university , columbia university , the university of california at berkeley and the university of southern california.among his other accomplishments , davis

served as president of the population association of america and the american sociological association
represented the united states on the united nations population commission
member of the advisory council of the national aeronautics and space administration and the advisory committee on population for the u.s. bureau of the census
was the first sociologist in the united states to be elected to the national academy of sciences ( 1966 ) .davis won the irene b. taeuber award for outstanding research in demography ( 1978 ) , the common wealth award for distinguished work in sociology ( 1979 ) , and the career of distinguished scholarship award from the american sociological association ( 1982 ) .
in 1953 he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association .


== research ==
davis led and conducted major studies of societies in europe , south america , africa and asia , coined the term `` population explosion , `` , and played a major role in the naming and development of the demographic transition model . he was also one of the original scholars in the development of the theory of overurbanization . he is also credited with coining the term `` zero population growth `` although george stolnitz claimed to have that distinction.davis had several children while espousing limitations on childbearing worldwide . davis also published an influential article with wilbert e. moore entitled `` some principles of stratification , `` which was a very influential functionalist account of the reasons for social inequality . davis and moore synthesize durkheim and parsons to argue for the `` functional necessity `` of some positions over others : those that are highest paid go to the most deserving individuals ; at the same time , the differential rewards motivates individuals to work to fill positions they might otherwise not . thus , from this perspective , illness is a deviant state because it means that the individual may not be able to fill their role . sociologists see this article as a paradigmatic case of functionalist logic , and indeed , davis came to be a leading figure in this school of sociology.as a demographer , davis was internationally recognized for his expertise in world population growth and resources , the history and theory of international migration , world urbanization , demographic transition and population policy .

hanoch albeck ( hebrew : חנוך אלבק ) ( august 7 , 1890 - january 9 , 1972 ) was a professor of talmud at the hebrew university in jerusalem , israel . he was one of the foremost scholars of the mishna in his time and he was one of the founders of the scientific approach to the study of the mishna .
hanoch 's father shalom albeck , known as the talmudic scholar , was the editor of a number of works by
rishonim including raavan , meiri on tractate yevamot , and haeshkol by abraham ben isaac of narbonne . hanoch studied at the vienna rabbinical academy and he received rabbinical ordination in 1915 . in 1921 he received a degree from the university of vienna . between 1926 and 1936 albeck taught in the hochschule für die wissenschaft des judentums in berlin . in 1935 he emigrated to mandatory palestine where he was immediately appointed as professor and head of the talmud department at the hebrew university in jerusalem , a position he held for 25 years .
albeck , who was a religiously observant jew , published a number of books in hebrew and german on rabbinical literature , including `` introduction to the mishna `` , `` studies in baraita and tosephta `` , `` introduction to the talmuds `` , and others . in addition , he published numerous articles in the journal tarbiz .
professor albeck also wrote a simple and concise commentary on the mishna , appending longer footnotes at the ends of each volume . pinchas kehati sometimes quotes this work in his own commentary on the mishna . while the vocalization ( niqqud ) received special attention in albeck 's edition , the text did not merit such attention , and therefore albeck 's mishna is not a fully scientific version of the latter . albeck 's version was written as a continuation and expansion of the uncompleted earlier work of hayyim nahman bialik .
albeck 's teachers include : david zvi miller and avigdor optowitzer . his students include : the talmudic scholar avraham goldberg and abraham joshua heschel ( one of the foremost jewish thinkers in the 20th century ) .
albeck married hendel weiss ( the sister of abraham weiss ) , and the two had three children . two of his children are professor michael albeck , a lecturer in organic chemistry , and professor shalom albeck , a lecturer in jewish law ( and the husband of advocate pliah albeck ) , both at bar ilan university . his grandson is amnon albeck a professor of chemistry and university ’ s vice-rector at bar-ilan university . albeck 's son in law , yoseph aryeh bachrach , was killed in the israeli war of independence in the battle for jerusalem , leaving behind a wife and two children .


== awards ==
in 1957 it was announced that albeck was to receive the israel prize ; however , as a matter of principle albeck refused to accept the award .
in 1959 albeck was elected as a member of the israel academy of sciences and humanities .
in 1969 albeck was awarded the bialik prize for jewish thought .

his keen interest in the theory of probability led him in 1902 to introduce a course in actuarial theory—the first course ever offered in this subject by any university in this country . as a result of his pioneering in this new field , his services were demanded by various states , the united states government , and by canada in connection with various insurance , pension and banking investigations . he has also served various insurance companies in the capacity of consulting actuary . from 1910 to 1929 he served the u. s. census bureau as expert special agent and during this time the united states life tables were prepared under his supervision ... from 1930 to 1932 , while on leave of absence ... professor glover served as president of the teachers insurance and annuity association of america .
from 1927 to 1934 he was the chair of the university of michigan 's department of mathematics . his graduate students include cecil c. craig .
in 1915 glover was elected a fellow of the casualty actuarial society . in 1924 he was an invited speaker of the icm in toronto .

= al-maydani =
ʿabd al-ghanī ibn ṭālib bin ḥamāda ibn ibrāhīm al-ghunaymī al-dimashqī al-maydānī ( عبد الغني الغنيمي الميداني الحنفي ) was a jurist ( faqīh ) and legal theorist ( uṣūlī ) adhering to the hanafi school as well as a traditionalist ( muḥaddith ) and grammarian ( naḥwī ) . born in 1222 ah in the maydān neighborhood in southern damascus , he was known for his vast knowledge and his eagerness to apply it . just as the neighborhood of his birth still bears this name to this day , he too has become known popularly as al-maydānī .


== his teachers and students ==
after memorizing the qurʾān , he studied with the greatest of the scholars in damascus during that era . these included :

shaykh ʿumar al-mujtahid al-dimashqī
the hanafi jurist saʿīd al-ḥalabī ( subsequently al-dimashqī )
the traditionalist and best known jurist of the levant shaykh imām ʿalā al-dīn ibn ʿabidīn
shafiʿī jurist ʿabd al-ghanī al-saqaṭī
hanafi jurist and author of radd al-muḥtār ʿalā al-durar al-mukhtār sayyid muḥammad amīn ibn ʿābidīn .
ʿabd al-raḥmān bin muḥammad al-kuzbarī al-shafiʿī , author of al-thabat .
aḥmad bībars
ḥasan ibn ibrāhīm al-bayṭār , the shafiʿī jurist of his era


== his qualities ==
there were many poetic verses written in praise of him , which can be found in ḥilya al-bashar fī tārikh al-qarn al-thālith ʿashar by shaykh ʿabd al-razzāq al-bayṭār . ( see volume 2 , pgs 867-870 )
when riots between muslims and christians in 1277 ah/1860 ce broke out , he played a significant role in extinguishing the chaos and restoring order . he was described as being far from antogonism and tribalism due to his distance from the material world and his piety .
many from the region of shām and beyond studied with him , including ʿallāma imām shaykh ṭāhir al-jazāʾiriī and ustādh saʿīd al-shartūnī al-lubnānī al-naṣrānī .


== his works ==
shaykh al-mayḍāni was not prolific in his writings , but he was certainly amongst the best in the works he did author . these include :
al-lubāb fī sharḥ al-kitāb in hanafi fiqh
- when al-kitāb is mentioned amongst the hanafis , the mukhtaṣar of al-qudurī is intended . imam al-qudūrī was the hanafi jurist and traditionist , abū al-ḥusayn aḥmad ibn muḥammad al-qudūrī al-baghdādī . it is with him the leadership of the hanafis in iraq comes to an end . he was born in 362 ah and died in 428 ah . he was also one of the teachers of al-ḥāfiẓ al-khaṭīb al-baghdādī , the author of tārīkh baghdād .
this mukhtaṣar is considered to be one of the reliable books within the hanafi school , used by adherents of the school into the present day . for this reason shaykh al-mayḍanī undertook the task of writing a commentary on it and elucidating its contents . he sought to relate the chosen and established legal positions . this book was widely accepted during his lifetime and after his death . he finished writing it on the 13th of ramadan in 1266 ah according to the most sound report . however , ismaʿīl bāshā al-baghdādī in hadiyya al-ʿārifīn and sarkīs in muʿjam al-maṭbūʿāt opine that the year was 1267 ah .
this book 's first edition was first published during the lifetime of the author in qasṭanṭaniya/asātina , modern-day istanbul , in the year 1274-1275 . thereafter , numerous editions were printed . unfortunately , many of those printed in egypt are filled with errors except those proofread by ustādh muḥammad muḥyī al-dīn ʿabd al-ḥamīd .
shaykh ʿabdul fattāh notes that he spent time in damascus on 20 muharram 1378 to review all of the manuscripts of shaykh al-maydānī . these included :

sharḥ al-marāh fī al-ṣarf , 133 pgs min al-qaṭʿi al-wasaṭ
sharḥ ʿaqīda al-imām al-ṭaḥāwī , 100 pgs
kashf al-iltibās ʿammā awradahū al-imām al-bukhārī ʿalā baʿḍ al-nās , 35 pgs . edited and published by shaykh abdul fattāh abū ghudda

= nicholas kemmer =
prof nicholas kemmer , frs frse ( 7 december 1911 – 21 october 1998 ) , was a russian-born nuclear physicist working in britain , who played an integral and leading edge role in united kingdom 's nuclear programme , and was known as a mentor of abdus salam – a nobel laureate in physics .


== life ==


=== early life ===
he was the son of nicholas p. kemmer and his wife , barbara statzer , and was born in saint petersburg , his family moved to germany in 1922 , where he was educated at bismarckschule hanover and then at the university of göttingen . he received his doctorate in nuclear physics at the university of zurich and worked as an assistant to wolfgang pauli , who had to give strong arguments in 1936 , before being allowed to employ a non-swiss national . later on , kemmer moved to the beit fellowship at imperial college london .


=== british nuclear development ===
he moved to trinity college , cambridge in 1940 to work on tube alloys , the wartime atomic energy project . in 1940 , when egon bretscher and norman feather showed that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would in theory produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product , kemmer ( who was lodging at the bretschers ' ) proposed the names neptunium for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets neptune and pluto beyond uranus ( uranium being element 92 ) . the americans edwin m. mcmillan and philip abelson at the berkeley radiation laboratory , who had made the same discovery , fortuitously suggested the same names .


=== professorship ===
he spent 1944–1946 in canada . at the university of edinburgh from 1953 to 1979 , he was tait professor of mathematical physics , creating the tait institute of mathematical physics in 1955 . he was elected as a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh in 1954 . his proposers were norman feather , max born , sir edmund whittaker and alexander aitken . he served as the society 's vice-president from 1971 to 1974.he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1956 and won its hughes medal in 1966 . kemmer was awarded the j. robert oppenheimer memorial prize in 1975 . nicholas kemmer was also a mentor and a teacher of the only pakistani nobel laureate , dr. abdus salam . kemmer is credited to trained and work with salam in neutron scattering by using relativity equations . salam later passed his research work to pakistani physics students who went on to contribute in this field .


== work and legacy ==


=== duffin–kemmer–petiau equation ===
the duffin–kemmer–petiau equation ( dkp equation , also called duffin–kemmer equation or kemmer equation ) plays a role in the description of the standard model of particles , together with the yang-mills field . the duffin–kemmer–petiau equation is closely linked to the proca equation and the klein–gordon equation . the dkp equation suffers the same drawback as the klein–gordon equation in that it calls for negative probabilities . the equation involves matrices which obey the duffin–kemmer–petiau algebra . the work leading to the dkp equation , culminating in kemmer 's article , has been quoted as `` the first attempt at writing down a satisfactory relativistic theory of elementary particles beyond the electron `` , and these equations have later been brought in unified form with the dirac equation by homi j. bhabha .


== recognition ==
nicholas kemmer road in edinburgh university 's king 's buildings complex is named in his honour .

= guidobaldo del monte =
guidobaldo del monte ( 11 january 1545 – 6 january 1607 , var . guidobaldi or guido baldi ) , marquis del monte , was an italian mathematician , philosopher and astronomer of the 16th century .


== biography ==
del monte was born in pesaro . his father , ranieri , was from a leading wealthy family in urbino . ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture . the duke of urbino , duke guidobaldo ii , honoured him with the title marchese del monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before guidobaldo . on the death of his father guidobaldo inherited the title of marchese .
guidobaldo studied mathematics at the university of padua in 1564 . while there he became a friend of the great italian poet torquato tasso . in fact guidobaldo may have known tasso before they studied at padua together , for tasso was almost exactly the same age as guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the duke of urbino , with the duke 's son , from 1556 .
guidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in hungary between the habsburg empire and the ottoman empire . after serving in the army , guidobaldo returned to his estate of ( monte baroccio ) mombaroccio in the marche , where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics , mechanics , astronomy and optics . he studied mathematics under federico commandino during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples . he also became a friend of bernardino baldi , who was also a student of commandino around the same time .
he corresponded with several mathematicians including giacomo contarini , francesco barozzi and galileo galilei . his invention of a drafting instrument for constructing regular polygons and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of galileo 's geometric and military compass .
guidobaldo was also important in helping galileo galilei in his academic career . galileo , then a promising , but unemployed 26-year-old , had written an essay on hydrostatic balance , which struck guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius . he then commended galileo to his brother , the cardinal del monte , who referred him to the powerful duke of tuscany , ferdinando i de ' medici . under his patronage , galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the university of pisa , in 1589 . guidobaldo became a staunch friend of galileo and helped him again in 1592 , when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the university of padua , due to the hatred and machinations of giovanni de ' medici , a son of cosimo i de ' medici , against galileo . notwithstanding their friendship , guidobaldo was a critic of galileo 's principle of the isochronicity of the pendulum , a major discovery which guidobaldo thought was impossible .
guidobaldo wrote an influential book about perspective , titled perspectivae libri vi , published at pesaro in 1600 . several painters , architects and the theater stage designer nicola sabbatini used this geometrical knowledge in their works .
he died at mombaroccio in 1607 .

john machlin buchanan ( september 29 , 1917 – june 25 , 2007 ) was an american professor of biochemistry at the massachusetts institute of technology . he arrived at mit in 1953 and retired in 1988 after a distinguished career in which he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences and the national academy of sciences . he played a key role in the development of mit 's department of biology as a major force in biochemistry research and was himself a prominent researcher of purine biosynthesis . he died in 2007 at age 89 .


== early life and education ==
buchanan was born in winamac , indiana in 1917 . he became interested in a career in science during a high school chemistry course . he attended depauw university as an undergraduate , where he gained his first scientific research experience , and from which he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry in 1938 . he received his m.s . from the university of michigan , ann arbor in 1939 , and later identified the head of its chemistry department , howard b. lewis , as a key influence in his research career . buchanan received his ph.d. from harvard university in 1943 under the supervision of albert baird hastings .


== academic career ==
buchanan arrived at mit in 1953 after reaching the rank of full professor at the university of pennsylvania medical school . he had been heavily recruited by the head of what was then called the department of molecular biology , francis o. schmitt . he became the head of the division of biochemistry and quickly began recruiting faculty interested in biochemistry research , including gene brown , vernon ingram , salvador luria , paul schimmel , phil robbins and lisa steiner ( the first woman faculty member in the department , hired in 1967 ) . he also sought out more senior scientists to bring to mit , including cyrus levinthal , maurice fox and alexander rich . james killian , the mit president responsible for recruiting buchanan , described the hire as among the most important and expensive hires he made , because the department 's biochemistry division under buchanan 's leadership quickly became widely well-regarded in the field . later , as biochemistry became more established , buchanan opposed some of the decisions made in the department , such as the shutdown of the division of biochemistry under department head boris magasanik and the planning under subsequent department head gene brown to launch the whitehead institute.buchanan was awarded the eli lilly award in biological chemistry in 1951 . he was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1953 and to the united states national academy of sciences in 1962 . buchanan became the first john and dorothy wilson professor in 1966 and retained the title till he retired in 1988 . in 2006 , mit endowed an annual lectureship in his name .


== research ==
buchanan 's graduate research formed one of the earliest uses of radiolabeling for studying metabolism . he is best known for his research on the biosynthesis of purines . often working in parallel with g. robert greenberg , buchanan 's research group made so much progress on this topic that they laid out their findings in a series of over 20 papers published in the journal of biological chemistry . buchanan and greenberg 's work together provided an understanding of the pathway through which purine bases could be converted to nucleotides .


== personal life ==
buchanan met his wife elsa during a visit to stockholm to work with hugo theorell . the two were married for 57 years and had four children . buchanan died in 2007 at age 89 .

moritz ludwig frankenheim ( june 29 , 1801 – january 14 , 1869 ) was a german physicist , geographer , and crystallographer .


== life and education ==
moritz ludwig frankenheim was born in 1801 in brunswick . his family was jewish . he attended the gymnasium ( high school ) there and in wolfenbüttel . afterwards he went to berlin to attend the alma mater berolinensis ( today humboldt university of berlin ) to study physics . in 1823 he completed a dissertation titled dissertatio de theoria gasorum et vaporum meditationes ( `` contemplations on the scientific theory of gases and vapors `` ) . inspired by the research of his teacher christian samuel weiss ( 1780-1856 ) , he became interested in crystallography . in 1827 he moved to the university of breslau , where he was assistant professor of physics , geography , and mathematics from 1827 to 1850 . in 1850 he was promoted to the position of professor of these subjects . after his retirement , he first moved to leipzig and then to dresden , where he died in 1869 at the age of 67 .


== work ==
frankenheim 's focus of research was crystallography , particularly studies of crystal structure and the mathematical and theoretical basis of the symmetry of crystals . by 1826 , he was already using the integer reciprocals of weiss ' coefficients ( the intersection of a plane with the three crystallographic axes ) to describe the spatial positions of crystal surfaces , from which the british crystallographer william hallowes miller ( 1801-1880 ) developed the concept of miller indices in 1839 . by assigning symmetry elements to the crystal systems defined previously by weiss and friedrich mohs ( 1773-1839 ) , frankenheim was able , for the first time , to define 32 point groups ( crystal classes ) and to classify them into four crystal systems ( the regular one , the fourfold , the twofold and the sixfold ) . from his observations he derived 15 lattice types for crystals , which were later reduced by auguste bravais ( 1811-1863 ) to 14 and today as bravais lattices describe unit cells of crystal structures . frankenheim conducted one of the first microscopic examinations of crystals in polarized light , using the then-new nicol prism as a polarizer .
in the field of geography , his most famous work is his book völkerkunde ( `` ethnology `` ) , published in 1852 .

= roland weitzenb c3 b6ck =
roland weitzenböck ( 26 may 1885 – 24 july 1955 ) was an austrian mathematician working on differential geometry who introduced the weitzenböck connection . he was appointed professor of mathematics at the university of amsterdam in 1923 at the initiative of brouwer , after hermann weyl had turned down brouwer ’ s offer .


== biography ==
roland weitzenböck was born in kremsmünster , austria-hungary . he studied from 1902 to 1904 at the technical military academy mödling ( now htl vienna ) and was a captain in the austrian army . he then studied at the university of vienna , where he graduated in 1910 with the dissertation zum system von 3 strahlenkomplexen im 4-dimensionalen raum ( the system of 3-rays complexes in 4-dimensional space ) . after further studies at bonn and göttingen , he became professor at the university of graz in 1912 . after army service in world war i , he became professor of mathematics at the karl-ferdinand university in prague in 1918 .
in 1923 weitzenböck took a position of professor of mathematics at the university of amsterdam , where he stayed until 1945 . he settled in blaricum , where he became a fully accepted member of the community . he was a man of few words , without observable political views . appearances are often , however , deceptive , and in this case the solid imperturbable exterior hid a considerable amount of frustration resulting from the disastrous course of the first world war . as so many german and austrian ex-service men , weitzenböck became a hard-core revanchist , and an implacable enemy of france . but whereas brouwer actively campaigned for the rehabilitation of german scientists , weitzenböck refrained from political activity . however , after the ‘ anschluss ’ of austria in 1938 , he started to vent his approval of hitler ’ s policies in private conversations . weitzenböck was elected member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences ( knaw ) in may 1924 , but suspended in may 1945 because of his attitude during the war . weitzenböck had been a member of the national socialist movement in the netherlands .
in 1923 weitzenböck published a modern monograph on the theory of invariants on manifolds that included tensor calculus . in the preface of this monograph one can read an offensive acrostic . one finds that the first letter of the first word in the first 21 sentences spell out :

nieder mit den franzosen ( down with the french ) .he also published papers on torsion . in fact , in his paper `` differential invariants in einstein ’ s theory of tele-parallelism `` weitzenböck had given a supposedly complete bibliography of papers on torsion without mentioning élie cartan . weitzenböck died in zelhem , netherlands in 1955 . his doctoral students include g. f. c. griss , daniel rutherford and max euwe .

ernst friedrich eduard richter ( 24 october 1808 – 9 april 1879 ) , was a german musical theorist , born at großschönau , saxony .
he first studied music at zittau , and afterwards at leipzig , where he attained so high a reputation that in 1843 he was appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorium of music , then newly founded by felix mendelssohn . on the death of moritz hauptmann on 3 january 1868 , he was elected cantor of thomasschule zu leipzig , conducting the thomanerchor , an office he retained until his death.he is best known by three theoretical works : lehrbuch der harmonie , lehre vom contra punct and lehre von der fuge , valuable textbooks known to english students through the translation by franklin taylor . `` ernst friedrich [ eduard ] richter [ ( 1808-1879 ) ] ... his compositions include psalms for chorus and orchestra , motets , two masses , a stabat mater ( voices only ) , part songs , string quartets and sonatas , and also pieces for organ and for piano . but it is his treatise on the theory of music that will keep professor richter 's name from oblivion . as already mentioned , two english editions have appeared : one in london ( printed without richter 's leave , by the way ) by mr. franklin taylor , which must by no means be accepted as a translation , but merely as a very moderate adaptation ; the other , unfortunately little known in this country , printed with richter 's consent by john p. morgan , in new york . the latter translation is most carefully done , and forms a strong contrast to the english edition . on last good friday , the 150th anniversary of the first production of bach 's matthew passion , the dear old cantor and beloved professor [ richter ] was laid to his last rest , accompanied to his grave by the solemn sound of the beautiful choral , jesu , meine zuversicht . more hearty regret has rarely filled the hearts of those standing round a musician 's grave . once more the voices of his choir arose in bach 's beautiful melody to wenn ich eimmal soil scheiden , and then with a last look at his coffin the crowd dispersed . but though gone to his last rest , the memory of many of us will long cherish , as one of the truest artists , most thorough musicians and excellent teachers , that we have ever met , the name of ernst friedrich richter . `` richter 's method of instruction—and the academy approach to harmonic education overall—was criticized by arnold schoenberg in his 1911 text , harmonielehre , or theory of harmony . schoenberg denounced the respective isolation of harmonic theory , counterpoint , and form in compositional education as productive only of an `` artless and primitive `` approach to composition .

eugene rabinowitch ( 1901–1973 ) was a russian-born american biophysicist who is best known for his work in relation to nuclear weapons , especially as a co-author of the franck report and a co-founder in 1945 of the bulletin of the atomic scientists , a global security and public policy magazine , which he edited until his death.when rabinowitch arrived in new york city , he was assisted by selig hecht ,

a man whose spontaneous sympathy , friendship and assistance were so generously given to me when i first came to america and felt lost in the human sea of new york.during world war ii , rabinowitch worked in the metallurgical laboratory ( or `` met lab `` ) , the manhattan project 's division at the university of chicago . at that time he was a member of the committee on political and social problems , chaired by james franck . rabinowitch wrote ( with help from leó szilárd ) what became known as the franck report . the report recommended that nuclear energy be brought under civilian rather than military control and argued that the united states should demonstrate the atomic bomb to world leaders in an uninhabited desert or barren island before using it in combat .
the social and ethical concerns expressed in the franck report translated into the guiding principles of the bulletin of the atomic scientists , founded by rabinowitch and fellow physicist hyman goldsmith . in the twenty-fifth anniversary issue of the bulletin , rabinowitch wrote that the magazine 's purpose `` was to awaken the public to full understanding of the horrendous reality of nuclear weapons and of their far-reaching implications for the future of mankind ; to warn of the inevitability of other nations acquiring nuclear weapons within a few years , and of the futility of relying on america 's possession of the 'secret ' of the bomb . `` over the years , rabinowitch wrote more than 100 articles for the magazine , most of them editorials .
before the war , rabinowitch passionately pursued research in photosynthesis , a field in which he was to become a leader . after world war ii , rabinowitch taught and researched botany as a professor at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , continuing his photosynthesis work and publishing the three-volume photosynthesis and related processes , as well as many other books .
a bibliography of rabinowitch 's publications was compiled by govindjee at the department of botany , university of illinois . the papers of rabinowitch are held in the special collections at the university of chicago library .

robert durrer ( 1890–1978 ) was a swiss engineer who developed the basic oxygen steelmaking process ( the linz-donawitz process , named after the towns where the technology was commercialized ) . the process was successfully tested by durrer in 1948 . a team led by dr theodor eduard suess in austria adapted the process and scaled it to industrial size , and it was commercialized by vöest and öamg.durrer graduated from the royal technical university of aachen in 1915 . he stayed in germany and in 1928 accepted the chair of the professor of metallurgy at the technical university of berlin . from 1933 to 1939 , during his time in nazi germany , durrer supervised experiments on the new steel making technique . in 1943 durrer returned from nazi germany to switzerland and was appointed to the board of von roll ag , the country 's largest steelmaker . durrer teamed up with heinrich heilbrugge and ran a series of experiments that established commercial viability of basic oxygen metallurgy . in 1947 durrer ordered a small experimental converter from the united states , and on 1 april 1948 durrer and heilbrugge produced their first oxygen-blown steel.in the summer of 1948 von roll ag and two austrian state-owned companies , vöest and öamg , agreed to commercialize the durrer process . their commercial converter furnaces were put into operation in november 1952 ( vöest in linz ) and may 1953 ( öamg , donawitz ) and temporarily became the leading edge of the world 's steelmaking , causing a surge in steel-related research . unlike europe , whose industrial capacity had been decimated by world war ii , america had a large base of steelmaking capacity , and it was economic to retain , rather than replace , its capital stock . u.s. steel and bethlehem steel nonetheless introduced oxygen steelmaking in 1964 ; by 1969 , its tonnage surpassed that manufactured using the bessemer process . japan became an early adopter and by 1970 produced 80 % of its steel in linz-donawitz furnaces . durrer 's contribution to practical steelmaking was marked by the aime benjamin f. fairless award , 1966. etc .
durrer was a professor at eth zurich from 1943 to 1961 . he edited and co-authored the multi-volume metallurgie des eisens ( metallurgy of iron , or the `` gmelin-durrer `` ) . the annual staudinger-durrer prize awarded by eth zurich commemorates durrer along with nobel prize winner hermann staudinger .

= ignazio cerio =
ignazio cerio ( 1841 – 1921 ) was an influential but eccentric physician and amateur philosopher on the island of capri , in italy . his father , imprisoned for his liberal beliefs , had spent his time in jail devising chemical concoctions and mechanical constructions that would never be made ; ignazio continued the family traditions of both liberalism and idiosyncratic inventiveness . ignazio even coined the word disutilità to refer to a human life lacking a sense of purpose but full of tension and reflection , mixing passionate pursuit of ideas with periods of lovesickness and ennui .
he worked for fifty years as a medical doctor on capri , a profession he followed with his characteristically unconventional flair . on one occasion , for example , he established a sanitorium at pozzuoli , claiming that the sulphurous gases would cure tuberculosis . the only patient to arrive at the sanitorium rejected the doctor 's contention that both sulphur and arsenic would be good for the health .
nevertheless , he remains a well-remembered and much-loved figure on the island of capri , his memory immortalised both in the writings of his son , edwin cerio ( particularly in la vita a la figura de un uomo ( 1921 ) ) and in the cultural centro caprense ignazio cerio , established in his name to organise conferences and meetings on medicine , italian and foreign literature , archaeology , palaeontology , and international and local history .
palazzo cerio , close to the piazzetta , hosts the ignazio cerio museum about capri 's natural history .

= john l. horn =
john leonard horn ( september 7 , 1928 – august 18 , 2006 ) was a scholar , cognitive psychologist and a pioneer in developing theories of multiple intelligence .
the structure of mental abilities
for his phd research at the university of illinois , horn identified other broad intellectual abilities to supplement fluid reasoning ability ( gf ) and crystalised ability ( gc ) postulated by his supervisor raymond cattell . as with cattell , horn rejected the existence of an even higher level factor of general intelligence ‘ g ’ asserted by spearman ( 1927 ) . in horn ( 1988 ) he reported a full list of such broad level abilities :
gc ( crystalised )
gf ( fluid )
gv ( visual )
ga ( auditory )
gq ( quantitative )
gs ( processing speed )
tsr ( long-term storage and retrieval )
sar ( short-term acquisition and retrieval )
the cattell-horn model was , more or less , replicated by carroll ’ s ( 1993 ) massive analysis by of 450+ intelligence measures , which also yielded a higher order factor similar to spearman ’ s ‘ g ’ . mcgrew ( 2005 ) reported that in 1999 the test publisher ‘ riverside publishing met with horn and carroll privately in chapel hill , north carolina , to seek a common , more meaningful umbrella term that would recognise the strong structural similarities of their respective theoretical models , yet also recognize their differences . this sequence of conversations resulted in a verbal agreement that the phrase “ cattell-horn-carroll theory of cognitive abilities ” made significant practical sense , and appropriately recognized the historical order of scholarly contribution of the three primary contributors . ’
the cattell-horn- carroll ( chc ) theory is the basis for many modern iq tests . horn 's parallel analysis , a method for determining the number of factors to keep in an exploratory factor analysis , is also named after him .

= charles tournemire =
charles arnould tournemire ( 22 january 1870 – 3 or 4 november 1939 ) was a french composer and organist , notable partly for his improvisations which were often rooted in the music of gregorian chant . his compositions include eight symphonies ( one of them choral ) , four operas , twelve chamber works and eighteen piano solos ; but he is remembered largely for his organ music , the best known being set of pieces l'orgue mystique .


== biography ==
born in bordeaux , tournemire moved in adolescence to paris , and there became one of césar franck 's three youngest students . ( the other two were henri büsser and a belgian , guillaume lekeu , the latter having been born only two days before tournemire . )
from 1898 ( on the resignation of gabriel pierné ) to 1939 , tournemire served as the organiste titulaire at franck 's old church , the basilique ste-clotilde , paris . he was also professor of chamber music at the paris conservatoire . in 1931 he published a biography of franck .
a year before the biography appeared , tournemire recorded five organ improvisations which were later transcribed by maurice duruflé from phonograph recordings . of ten 78-rpm discs which tournemire made in 1930 , playing the aristide cavaillé-coll organ of sainte-clotilde ( polydor 561047 , 561048 , 566057 , 566058 , 566059 ) , five contain franck compositions . this set of discs was awarded the grand prix du disque on may 18 , 1931 and has been reissued on both lp and cd .
insofar as tournemire 's name is now remembered , it is usually spoken of in connection with his biggest composition : l'orgue mystique , a group of 51 sets of five pieces each ( except for holy saturday , which contains only three pieces ) , all written between 1927 and 1932 . this collection covers the cycle of the roman catholic liturgical year , each set being based on the gregorian chants for the day . unlike the symphonies of charles-marie widor , which are usually heard in secular recitals ( even when individual movements of these symphonies had liturgical origins , as they sometimes did ) , l'orgue mystique was designed through and through for church use .
tournemire died in arcachon , france in 1939 . the precise cause of his death is uncertain , as is the exact date ( 3 or 4 november ) .

leon lichtblau ( also known under the pseudonym adolf cristin , russian : адолф иванович кристин ; august 23 , 1901 - april 25 , 1938 ) was a romanian socialist and communist militant , and soviet statistician who was executed during the great purge .
he was born in bucharest , romania , in the family of a jewish architect . while studying at gheorghe lazăr high school , he attended the scientific conferences organised by the local folk university . here he met and befriended several young workers , who introduced him to socialists ideas . in 1918 , when socialist militants gheorghe cristescu , alecu constantinescu and ecaterina arbore were arrested by the german authorities occupying southern romania , leon was one of the organisers of a public demonstration demanding their release . he was also a participant in the manifestations which accompanied the departure of the german army , being noted for his pro-revolutionary and anti-monarchical chants .
on december 13 , 1918 leon lichtblau was arrested along with other militants during a large workers ' demonstration in bucharest . sent to trial for `` rebellion and unrest `` , he was reproached by the presiding judge for his political opinions . to the judge 's allegation that students , and people of intellectual background in general , should n't be taking part in the socialist movement , he replied by reading a list of socialist leaders , whom he identified as his role models . in 1920 , after completing high school , he enrolled in the university of bucharest 's faculty of mathematics . in the same year he accommodated anarchist max goldstein while the latter was preparing for the bombing of the romanian senate .
in 1921 he went to iaşi to support the local workers ' movement , but soon returned to bucharest , narrowly escaping arrest during the crackdown on the socialist conference taking place in the former city . back in bucharest he participated in the may 1921 congress of the socialist party of romania , where he supported the party 's affiliation with the comintern . in the summer of that year he was part of the romanian delegation to the second congress of the young communist international in moscow . on his return to romania he found out that the authorities were offering a 200,000 lei reward for his and others communists ' capture , and went into hiding . on october 15 , the 2nd army corps issued an arrest warrant on his name . pressure was put on his family to reveal his location , his home was repeatedly searched , his brother interrogated , while his sister was forced to sign a declaration condemning leon 's activities to be allowed to finish her studies at the bucharest conservatory . leon lichtblau eventually fled the country , staying in vienna , and , after being expelled from austria , in berlin . in 1922 , as part of the dealul spirii trial , he was sentenced in absentia to lifetime forced labour , and another arrest warrant was issued for him .
not able to return to romania , leon settled in moscow , adopting the pseudonym adolf cristin . here he graduated in economics from the institute of red professors in 1926 , later becoming the head of the industry department of the central office of economic accounting of the ussr . at the request of the communists in romania , he translated a part of vladimir lenin 's works in romanian , under the coordination of david fabian . for a short time in 1928 he was a member in political bureau of the central committee of the communist party of romania , along with fellow exiles fabian and elek köblös .
he was arrested on april 5 , 1937 , during the stalinist purges . on april 25 , 1938 he was indicted with `` spying and provocative activities and membership in a right-wing counter-revolutionary organisation `` , and was executed on the same day . leon lichtblau was posthumously rehabilitated by a decision of the soviet supreme court on october 3 , 1956 , as well as by a commission of the romanian communist party in 1968 .

richard henry bolt ph.d. , better known as richard bolt or dick bolt , ( peking , china , april 22 , 1911 – boston , massachusetts , january 13 , 2002 ) was an american physics professor at mit with an interest in acoustics . he was one of the founders of the company bolt , beranek and newman , which built the arpanet , a forerunner of the internet .


== early life ==
bolt was born in peking , china , where his parents were medical missionaries . his family returned to the u.s. in 1916 and settled in california .
bolt graduated from berkeley high school , california in 1928 and went to college and graduate school at the university of california , berkeley .
although he initially expected to major in either music or graphical design , he decided on architecture , in which he attained a ba in 1933 . at that time , he had already developed an interest in acoustics , combining his interests for music , design and architecture .
after his marriage to katherine mary smith , right after his graduation in 1933 , they made a honeymoon to europe , where he became acquainted with a number of scientists from berlin , and the honeymoon was extended to ten months while bolt learned german and studied acoustics .


== berkeley ==
returning to berkeley in 1934 , he entered the graduate physics program , and , earning an m.a . in 1937 and qualifying for berkeley 's physics ph.d. program , which he completed in 1939 . he performed his research at ucla , given the fact that berkeley had no acoustics research facilities at that time . after attaining his phd in 1939 he worked at mit for a year on the transmission of sound in various shapes of rooms . excluding a brief period at the university of illinois and a stationing in london during wwii , he remained associated with the mit until his retirement .


== mit and bbn ==
bolt started a consulting firm with another mit professor , leo beranek , in 1948 , and worked on such projects as doing an audio analysis of the jfk assassination , the `` 18.5 minute gap `` in nixon 's white house tapes , and improving the sound in concert halls . in later years , after the addition of one of his former students , robert newman , the firm of bolt , beranek and newman , better known as bbn , designed the first modem in 1963 , helping computers communicate with each other . this led to work on the arpanet , which became the internet . bbn helped develop e-mail and , in 1971 , one of bbn 's researchers , ray tomlinson , chose the `` @ `` sign for e-mail addresses . bolt retired in 1976 .

= jakob kunz =
jakob kunz ( november 3 , 1874 – july 18 , 1938 ) was an american physicist who pioneered the development and application of photoelectric cells . born in brittnau , switzerland , he earned his bachelor 's degree in 1897 and his ph.d in 1902 from the eidgenossisches polytechnikum in zurich , and active in the bahá ' í faith from 1921 .


== physics department ==
kunz arrived at the university of illinois in 1909 as a theoretical physicist . he taught most of the graduate courses and supervised half of the ph . ds up to 1929 . larazus notes that “ he was clearly the intellectual leader of the department . ” one of his students was e. frances seiler who became the first woman to earn a ph.d in physics at illinois for her thesis on the color-sensitivity of photoelectric cells . kunz also wrote papers on and gave public lectures on relativity .


== photoelectric cells and astronomical photometry ==
kunz made significant contributions to construction of photoelectric cells improving on the methods introduced by elster and geitel . during the fall of 1911 , he began a collaboration and friendship with the university of illinois observatory director joel stebbins that would revolutionize astronomical photometry . kunz ’ s photoelectric cells were many times more sensitive that what was available commercially and therefore able to detect faint star light . kunz ’ s cells would be used at half a dozen observatories all across the nation including yerkes observatory , lick observatory , and washburn observatory . kunz also accompanied stebbins and four solar eclipse expeditions beginning with the solar eclipse of june 8 , 1918 to measure the total light of the solar corona with the photoelectric photometer . the collaboration between stebbins and kunz continued until kunz ’ s death in 1938.kunz also collaborated with electrical engineering professor joseph tykociński-tykociner to use a photoelectric cell to photograph sound and reproduce it electronically . when tykociner demonstrates the first sound-on-film motion picture recordings in 1921 in urbana , the projector had a kunz cell at its heart .


== family ==
jakob kunz was the son of jakob and anna marie weber kunz . he was married to anna bolliger about 1913 and had two daughters anna marie and margaret . stebbins remembers kunz as “ the proverbial simplicity of a true scientist ; he was liberal in politics and religions , and was always an enthusiastic worker for social justice . ”
in the urbana area kunz and his wife were active in the bahá ' í faith . in 1922 he spoke on the subject of the harmony of science and religion , a subject he and anna had spoken with ` abdu ' l-bahá on during their pilgrimage the year before . in 1919 they had co-signed a letter to ` abdu ' l-bahá following the break in communication with the bahá'ís during world war i . they spent about a year abroad . the kunz daughters annamarie and margaret lead a class of a youth session of louhelen bahá ' í school in the summer of 1937 . the kunz family would continue to speak at and sometimes host events of the religion in the coming years . following kunz ' death , anna moved to switzerland to help spread the religion there where she died in august , 1973 their daughter anna marie ( annamarie ) honnold gave some talks , and authored a well-known collection of stories about 'abdu ' l-bahá . their other daughter margaret married david ruhe and long served as an assistant to ruhiyyih khanum in her various travels .

johann adam steinmetz ( 24 september 1689 in großkniegnitz – 10 july 1762 in prester , magdeburg ) was a german lutheran pastor , pietist , educator and one of the most significant revivalists in 18th century europe .
after studies he worked as a pastor in töppliwoda and later ( 1720–1730 ) he served a congregation in teschen . “ jesus church ” in teschen was of unique importance – it was visited by crowds from the upper silesia and by many secret protestants from northern moravia ; services were held in polish , german and czech .
remnants of the bohemian brethren visited steinmetz and he mentored and counseled them , thus preparing the revival among them . steinmetz ’ s role in the renewal of the moravian church is praised in zinzendorf ’ s memoirs and he is considered to be the leader of the revival in moravia according to an inscription in the deaths register of bethlehem .
pastor steinmetz was a patron of a lutheran school in teschen . due to his versatile service in the pietistic spirit , steinmetz was hated by the catholic clergy and emperor charles vi finally expelled him from all habsburg lands in 1730 . he went to neustadt an der aisch and later to the area around town magdeburg , where he led excellent school in the former monastery berga .
steinmetz was in touch with wesley and the american revivalists . he translated works of jonathan edwards and philip doddridge into german .

james gilchrist lawson ( 1874–1946 ) was a prolific british christian author and compiler . most notably , he compiled biographical sketches into deeper experiences of famous christians ( 1911 ) , which is a landmark text in pentecostal and charismatic history . this book draws broadly from christian history and the wesleyan holiness movement to include many post-conversion experiences with the holy spirit , which lawson believed to be the baptism of the holy spirit . in this way , it connects the modern pentecostal movement , which began in 1900 , to the much larger stream of christian theology and history . biographical sketches include girolamo savonarola , fenelon , madame guyon , john wesley , charles finney , william booth , and many others . author and professor dallas willard wrote that deeper experiences is ″the one book other than the bible that has most influenced me.″ lawson was editor of the marked reference bible , which was an expansion on the christian worker 's new testament which he had published in 1924 . the marked reference bible includes a chain-reference and a color-coding system . the four colors represent the primary topics of salvation ( red ) , the holy spirit ( green ) , temporal blessings ( brown ) , and prophetic subjects ( blue ) . this bible comes highly recommended by winkie pratney as a reference for biblical theology . the bible allows you to see not only where a topic or subtopic is mentioned , but how many times , as a guide to that topic 's importance to the biblical text.lawson was also a prolific compiler of quotes and stories . his compilations include greatest thoughts about the bible , greatest thoughts about jesus christ , greatest thoughts about god , the world ’ s best humorous anecdotes ( 1923 ) , the world ’ s best conundrums and riddles of all ages ( 1924 ) , the world 's best epigrams ( 1924 ) , and the best loved religious poems . in 1941 , lawson published a compilation of biographical sketches called famous missionaries .
james lawson says of himself in the introduction to greatest thoughts about god , ″for the greater part of his life the compiler of this volume has been collecting the greatest thoughts of the greatest thinkers on the greatest themes . during the years the compiler has engaged in evangelistic work in the united states and great britain , he was able to consult the best books in the best libraries of america and britain and to glean the best thoughts from them . while engaged in journalistic work , for five years , for the leading religious papers , in london , england , he was brought in contact with most of the religious leaders of the world and garnered the best thoughts from them . through his connection with the religious publishing business during the last ten years , he has been able to collect the best thoughts from all the leading religious papers . owing to the exceptional privileges which have been given to him by the providence of god , the compiler of this volume is able to give to the world the very cream of religious thoughts concerning god.″

= moritz von aberle =
moritz von aberle ( 25 april 1819 – 3 november 1875 ) was a german catholic theologian .
born at rottum , near biberach , in swabia , he died at tübingen . he became professor in the obergymnasium , at ehingen , in 1845 ; director of the wilhelmstift , in 1848 ; professor of moral theology and new testament exegesis in the university at tübingen , in 1850 , a position he retained till the day of his death .
he had a considerable number of pupils in both branches , but he was especially devoted to scriptural studies . he emphasized the activity of the human bearers of revelation , without changing it into a purely natural process . von aberle published the results of his investigations in a series of articles . the main thoughts of these articles were collected and published under the title `` introduction to the new testament `` , by dr. paul schanz ( freiburg , 1877 ) . aberle 's view that the gospels and the book of acts are apologetic writings , meeting certain needs of the apostolic times , can not be sustained . he took also an active part in the struggle for ecclesiastical liberty in württemberg , and his strong newspaper articles forced the state to arrange church matters on a tolerable basis .

erich walter zimmermann , resource economist , was born in mainz , germany , on july 31 , 1888 and died in austin , united states of america , on february 16 , 1961 . he was an economist at the university of north carolina and later the university of texas .
zimmermann of the institutional school of economics called his real world theory the functional theory of mineral resources . his followers have coined the term resourceship to describe the theory . unlike traditional descriptive inventories , zimmermann 's method offered a synthetic assessment of the human , cultural , and natural factors that determine resource availability .
zimmermann rejected the assumption of fixity . resources are not known , fixed things ; they are what humans employ to service wants at a given time . to zimmermann ( 1933 , 3 ; 1951 , 14 ) , only human `` appraisal `` turns the `` neutral stuff `` of the earth into resources . what are resources today may not be tomorrow , and vice versa . according to zimmermann , `` resources are not , they become . ``
`` according to the definition of ew zimmerman , the word , `` resource `` does not refer to a thing but to a function which a thing may perform to an operation in which it may take part , namely , the function or operation of attaining a given end such a satisfying a want .

= alexander heidel =
alexander heidel ( 1907–1955 ) was an assyriologist and biblical scholar , and a member of the research staff of the oriental institute of the university of chicago .


== major publications ==


=== the babylonian genesis : the story of creation ( 1942 ) ===
`` babylonian genesis `` is a translation and commentary on the babylonian epic known as enuma elish ( the first two words of the text , translated as `` when on high ... `` ) . on its publication it was reviewed in the journal of the american oriental society as `` a sober and lucid translation of the epic in the most completely restored form available to date . `` [ 1 ] the university of chicago press published the first edition in 1942 and the second edition in 1951 . the book remains in print .
the book consists of four chapters . chapter 1 outlines the discovery of the enuma elish , its purpose , date , source and structure , followed by a literal translation ; chapter 2 gives translations of the other babylonian and mesopotamian creation accounts as known at the time ; chapter 3 treats the accounts of babylonian creation stories preserved in classical texts ( berossus and damascius ) ; and chapter 4 compares the babylonian creation stories with those contained in genesis .
heidel aimed his book not at other assyriologists but at biblical scholars and christian ministers , and it should be regarded as a work of christian apologetics rather than as a contribution to heidel 's own field of assyriology . many of his arguments stressing the uniqueness of the genesis creation story have been overturned by later scholarship , but at the time of its publication the book was a milestone in introducing the wider public to the parallels between mesopotamian and hebrew mythology .


=== the gilgamesh epic and old testament parallels ( 1946 ) ===
heidel 's book on the gilgamesh flood myth is a comparison of the mesopotamian epic with the biblical account of noah 's ark and the biblical deluge . the university of chicago press published the first edition in 1946 and the second edition in 1949 . the book remains in print .

ernest herman joseph bors , md ( 1900–1990 ) was a pioneer in the multidisciplinary care of individuals with spinal cord injury ( sci ) . he earned his medical degree in 1925 at charles university in prague , czechoslovakia . early in his career he studied anatomy and held research and faculty positions at the universities in zurich , switzerland and freiburg , germany . in 1938 , he emigrated to the united states where he became a citizen . at the outbreak of world war ii , bors joined the army medical corps.bors became interested in spinal cord injury while caring for veterans after the war . in 1944 , he joined the staff of hammond general army hospital in modesto , california . as assistant chief of urology , bors was urology consultant to the hospital 's spinal cord injury care section . at that time , comprehensive care for the injured veterans was hindered by a lack of a cohesive approach to their complex medical and social problems . bors was appalled by the lack of specific interventions for bladder management and other conditions secondary to spinal cord injury . he was motivated to devote his career to improving every aspect of the care of individuals with spinal cord injury .
as a result of his experiences , bors became the foremost expert on neurourology in traumatic spinal cord injury . he also developed a holistic multidisciplinary approach that formed the foundation for modern spinal cord injury care centers . his successful organization of a comprehensive specialized ward attracted the attention of the war department . modeled on bors ' innovative approach , in 1945 , the war department opened the first spinal cord injury center in the united states at birmingham general army hospital in van nuys , california , with bors in charge . soon , he had 220 patients under his care . military doctors from around the country visited his facility and began to establish similar centers around the country .
in 1958 , bors helped oversee the construction of a new facility dedicated to the sci service , which is now known as long beach va medical center . for the next two decades , doctors and administrators from around the world observed the innovative work of bors and his colleague , dr. estin comarr . by 1970 , the year he retired , bors had overseen the care of more than 2,500 people with sci . through his efforts , the number of sci centers increased in the us , as well as the staff-to-patient ratio . bors authored more than 140 scientific papers and a major textbook , co-authored by estin comarr and titled , neurological urology , physiology of micturition , its neurological disorders and sequelae , which remains the authoritative text in this field.bors is recognized as a pioneer who `` carried the torch of care and research and opened the way for better care `` of all individuals with spinal cord injury . he is memorialized by the ernest bors award for scientific development , which is administered by the journal of spinal cord medicine , the official journal of the american paraplegia society . the annual award recognizes the best article published in the journal by a young investigator .

franz josef von gerstner ( german : franz josef von gerstner , czech : františek josef gerstner ; 23 february 1756 – 25 july 1832 ) was a german-bohemian physicist and engineer .


== life ==
gerstner was born in komotau then in the holy roman empire ( today 's chomutov in the czech republic ) . he was the son of florian gerstner ( 1730–1783 ) and maria elisabeth , born englert . he studied at the jesuits gymnasium in komotau . after which he studied mathematics and astronomy at the faculty of philosophy in prague between 1772 and 1777 . in 1781 , he started to study medicine at the university of vienna , but quickly decided to work in the astronomical observatory instead . in 1789 , he became professor of mathematics there .
in 1795 , gerstner became a member of the government commission which tried to improve higher technical education in the austrian empire . following his suggestion , the old prague engineering school institute of engineering education ( czech : česká stavovská inženýrská škola ) founded by emperor joseph i , was converted to a polytechnic school in 1803 . gerstner became director of the polytechnic in 1806 and also professor of mechanics and hydraulics . he taught there until 1823 , when he was forced to stop due to an illness . the polytechnic still exists today as the czech technical university in prague ( čvut ) , and the institute for artificial intelligence and cybernetics research at čvut bears the name gerstner laboratory . he died , aged 76 , in mladějov .


== work ==
from his published works , the most important ones were theory of waves ( 1804 ) and handbuch der mechanik ( 1831 ; handbook of mechanics ) . this last book appeared in three volumes , with 1400 subscribers .
his work focused on applied mechanics , hydrodynamics and river transportation . he helped to build the first iron works and first steam engine in czech lands . in 1807 , he suggested the construction of a horse-drawn railway between the austrian empire towns of budweis ( today 's české budějovice ) and linz . this railway was later actually built between 1827 and 1829 by his son franz anton ( ritter ) von gerstner ( czech : františek antonín gerstner , 1796 , prague - 1840 , philadelphia ( de ) ) .
the so-called gerstner wave is the trochoidal wave solution for periodic water waves – the first correct and nonlinear theory of water waves in deep water , appearing even before the first correct linearised theory – published by gerstner in 1802 .

= friedrich waismann =
friedrich waismann ( german : [ ˈvaɪsman ] ; 21 march 1896 – 4 november 1959 ) was an austrian mathematician , physicist , and philosopher . he is best known for being a member of the vienna circle and one of the key theorists in logical positivism .


== biography ==
born to a jewish family in vienna , austria-hungary , waismann was educated in mathematics and physics at the university of vienna . in 1922 , he began to study philosophy under the tutelage of moritz schlick , the founder of the vienna circle . he emigrated to the united kingdom in 1938 due to the annexation of austria by nazi germany .
he was a reader in philosophy of science at the university of cambridge from 1937 to 1939 , and lecturer in philosophy of mathematics at the university of oxford from 1939 until his death . he died in oxford .


== relationship with wittgenstein ==
intermittently , from 1927 until 1936 , waismann had extensive conversations with ludwig wittgenstein about topics in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of language . these conversations , recorded by waismann , were published in ludwig wittgenstein and the vienna circle ( 1979 , ed . b.f. mcguinness ) . other members of the circle ( including schlick , rudolf carnap , and herbert feigl ) also spoke with wittgenstein , but not to waismann 's extent .
at one point in 1934 , wittgenstein and waismann considered collaborating on a book , but these plans fell through after their philosophical differences became apparent .
waismann later accused wittgenstein of obscurantism because of what he considered to be his betrayal of the project of logical positivism and empirically-based explanation . ultimately the texts for the project , written or just transcribed by waismann , have been published by gordon baker in 2003 .


== linguistic philosophy and logical positivism ==
in introduction to mathematical thinking : the formation of concepts in modern mathematics ( 1936 ) , waismann argued that mathematical truths are true by convention rather than being necessarily ( or verifiably ) true . his collected lectures , the principles of linguistic philosophy ( 1965 ) , and how i see philosophy ( 1968 , ed . r. harré ) , a collection of papers , were published posthumously .


== porosity and verifiability ==
waismann introduced the concept of open texture , or porosity to describe the universal possibility of vagueness in empirical statements . it is based on the wittgenstein , philosophical investigations , particularly section 80 . according to the philosopher , even after measures have been taken to ensure that a statement is precise , there remains an inexhaustible source of vagueness due to an indefinite number of possibilities . waismann 's notion of vagueness is slightly different from his concept of open texture . he explained that open texture is more like the possibility of vagueness . the latter can also be remedied so that it can be made more precise while the former can not .open texture has been found in legal philosophy through the writings of h. l. a. hart ( see hart 's `` the concept of law about rule skepticism `` and waismann 's article `` verifiability `` ) . according to hart , vagueness constitutes a fundamental feature of legal languages . it is cited , however , that waismann 's conceptualization has limited practical application since it is more for the extraordinary while hart 's view of open texture concerned the more mundane , favoring to approach the term in the context of a particular norm .

= richard clarke cabot =
richard clarke cabot ( may 21 , 1868 – may 7 , 1939 ) was an american physician who advanced clinical hematology , was an innovator in teaching methods , and was a pioneer in social work .


== early life and education ==
richard clarke cabot was born may 21 , 1868 , in brookline , massachusetts , one of five sons of james elliot cabot and elizabeth ( dwight ) cabot . james cabot was a philosopher and harvard university professor who also trained as a lawyer and biographer , and was a friend of ralph waldo emerson .


== professional career ==

cabot studied philosophy at harvard university before switching to medicine . inspired by the beliefs of john dewey , cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation , and he admired the work of teddy roosevelt and jane addams . after completing his studies in 1892 , he turned down the role of the first bacteriologist at massachusetts general hospital to work in the hospital 's much less prestigious outpatient department . at this time , outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who could n't afford inpatient treatment , or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such tuberculosis or diabetes . this involved working populations who lived in unhealthy , overcrowded accommodation , often recent migrants.he changed the way that the outpatient department was run , believing that economic , social , family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with . he envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors , the former concentrating on physiological health , and the latter on social health . in addition to this , he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting . in 1905 cabot created one of the first positions of professional social worker in the world , given to garnet pelton , and then to ida maud cannon . although clarke credited his approach as similar to that of anne cummins in london . the hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers , and cabot had to pay their wages himself . pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire . cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became head of social work at the hospital . cabot and cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients , including art classes for psychiatric patients , low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person 's likelihood of developing tuberculosis.in 1917 cabot took up a position in the medical reserve corps for a year . he returned briefly to massachusetts general hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at harvard 's department of social ethics in 1919 . at this time , the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers , as up to this point , cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years . he went on to write about his experiences in his book social workhe is also credited with discovering cabot rings , and for describing , along with his colleague , locke , the eponymous cabot-locke murmur , a diastolic murmur occasionally heard in severe anemia , unrelated to heart valve abnormalities .
cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at massachusetts general hospital ( mgh ) that featured generating differential diagnoses , and founded the long-standing feature of case record of mgh in new england journal of medicine .


== family and personal life ==
cabot 's paternal grandfather , samuel cabot , jr. , became a sailor at age 19 and married elizabeth perkins , daughter of a successful boston trader . samuel cabot iii later took over the running of the firm .
richard married ella lyman , and both held transcendentalist views . this philosophy , as well as his parents ' commitment to philanthropy , had a strong influence of richard . around the end of the 19th century , such ideals were out of favor , with the dominant beliefs at the time being social darwinism .

= adriaan fokker =
adriaan daniël fokker ( dutch pronunciation : [ ˈaːdriaːn ˈdaːniɛl ˈfɔkər ] ; 17 august 1887 – 24 september 1972 ) was a dutch physicist and musician . he was the inventor of the fokker organ , a 31-tone equal-tempered organ .


== life and work ==
adriaan daniël fokker was born on 17 august 1887 in buitenzorg , dutch east indies ( now bogor , indonesia ) . he was a cousin of the aeronautical engineer anthony fokker .
fokker studied mining engineering at the delft university of technology and physics at the university of leiden with hendrik lorentz , where he earned his doctorate in 1913 . he continued his studies with albert einstein , ernest rutherford and william bragg . in his 1913 thesis , he derived the fokker–planck equation along with max planck . after his military service during world war i he returned to leiden as lorentz ' and ehrenfest 's assistant . fokker became a physics teacher at the gymnasium of delft after 1918 and was appointed in 1923 as the first professor of applied physics at the technische hoogeschool delft ( today delft university of technology ) .
in 1928 fokker succeeded hendrik lorentz as director of research at teylers museum in haarlem .
fokker made several contributions to special relativity , and some less well-known contributions to general relativity , particularly in the area of geodetic precession , the phenomena of precession of a freely falling gyroscope in a gravitational field.fokker began to study music theory during the second world war , when the university of leiden was closed ; partly this was due to a desire to convince the nazis he would be of no use to the war effort , and partly it was a response to reading the work of christiaan huygens on the 31 equal temperament .
in 1938 , fokker – along with dirk coster and otto hahn – helped jewish-born physicist lise meitner escape from austria to the netherlands . `` fokker and coster both knew that university positions were virtually unavailable for foreigners . laboratory space was not a problem , however , either in groningen or haarlem . 'perhaps we can tap colleagues for regular contributions , ' coster suggested . fokker set a goal of f.20,000 , enough to support meitner for five years , and immediately began contacting colleagues for advice and donations . `` they were unsuccessful in obtaining funding , but fokker succeeded in getting official permission for meitner to leave , although he was unable to telegraph that to her due to secrecy . she escaped barely in time to evade arrest.the year 1942 consequently marked a turning point in his life ; after then he wrote many pieces in 31-equal , which are notable for using the 7th harmonic as a consonant interval ( 31-equal has a much better approximation of the 7th harmonic than the ubiquitous 12-equal ) . he also made notable contributions to music theory , such as the fokker periodicity block .
in 1949 he became member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences.he died on 24 september 1972 , at the age of 85 , in beekbergen near apeldoorn .


=== musical instruments ===

fokker designed and had built a number of keyboard instruments capable of playing microtonal scales via a generalized keyboard . the best-known of these is his 31-tone equal-tempered organ , which was installed in teyler 's museum in haarlem in 1951 . it is commonly called the fokker organ . the fokker organ is currently property of the huygens-fokker foundation and it moved to the bamzaal in muziekgebouw aan 't ij . regularly concerts take place on this instrument in the bamzaal .

= w. j. e. bennett =
william james early bennett ( 1804–1886 ) was an anglican priest . bennett is celebrated for having provoked the decision that the doctrine of the real presence is a dogma not inconsistent with the creed of the church of england . this followed the publication of his pamphlet a plea for toleration in the church of england ( 1867 ) in the form of a letter to edward bouverie pusey .
bennett was born at halifax , nova scotia , on 15 november 1804 , the eldest of three sons of major william bennett , re , and mary early , daughter of james early , an officer of the 1st royal garrison battalion . his younger brother , george augustus bennett ( 1807-45 ) , like their father , served in the corps of royal engineers , board of ordnance . his youngest brother , frederick hamilton bennett ( 1816–73 ) , ordained to the curacy of daventry ( 1840 ) , curate-in-charge of st john 's , worcester ( 1842–51 ) , master of arts , christ church , oxford ( 1843 ) , served his final appointment as the first vicar of saint mary the virgin , freeland , oxfordshire , from 1869 .
bennett was educated at westminster school and christ church , oxford ( ba , 1827 , ma , 1829 ) . he married mary concetta franklin in 1828 , prior to being ordained a priest by the bishop of london on 6 june 1830 . he initially served in 1830 as curate of oxford chapel ( later called st. peter 's , vere street , london ) , but he soon moved to curacies at holy trinity church marylebone ( 1830–1833 ) , followed by all souls church , langham place ( 1833–1838 ) . for a while he held this latter post alongside the perpetual curacy of portman chapel , portman square 1836-1841 ) . his post was subsequently redesignated as perpetual curate of st paul 's church , knightsbridge and st barnabas , pimlico . he supervised the completion of the former church and was effectively the founder of the latter . at the same time he conceived the idea of establishing a college there to accommodate the priests and its choristers . in 1851 he felt obliged to resign these posts following doctrinal complaints and a theological dispute with his bishop , charles james blomfield - after being accused of ritualism . finally in 1852 he was appointed as vicar of the church of st john the baptist , frome or frome-selwood in somerset , where he remained until his death on 17 august 1886 .
a prolific writer , his numerous works were listed in successive editions of crockford 's clerical directory . his publication the old church porch ( 1854–1862 ) , issued at frome , is sometimes cited as being in effect the first parish magazine , although this claim has been disputed.a more detailed account of his life and of his contribution to the oxford movement was provided by his nephew frederick bennett ( frederick hamilton bennett 's son ) formerly rector of farleigh , surrey .

josef labor ( 29 june 1842 – 26 april 1924 ) was an austrian pianist , organist , and composer of the late romantic era . labor was an influential music teacher . as a friend of some key figures in vienna , his importance was enhanced .
labor was born in the town of hořovice in bohemia to josef labor , an administrator of ironworks , and his wife josefa wallner , coming from a doctors-family . at the age of three , he was left blind due to contracting smallpox . he attended the institute for the blind in vienna and the konservatorium der gesellschaft der musikfreunde ( conservatory of the society of friends of music ) where he studied composition with bruckner ’ s teacher , simon sechter , and piano with eduard pickhert .
he toured europe as a pianist and , in the process , formed a lasting friendship with king georg v of hanover , who was also blind . georg named him royal chamber pianist in 1865 . the following year , the two men settled in vienna , where labor began organ lessons and became a teacher , while continuing to compose and perform .
in 1904 , labor received the title kaiserlich und königlich hoforganist ( royal and imperial court organist ) and is today best known for his organ works . labor took a serious interest in early music and wrote continuo elaborations for heinrich biber ’ s sonatas .
labor taught many notable musical personalities including alma schindler ( who married gustav mahler and others ) , paul wittgenstein and arnold schoenberg . alma schindler studied with labor for 6 years , beginning when she was 14 , and her diaries contain numerous references to her esteemed teacher .
labor was exceedingly close to paul wittgenstein 's family . he attended many musical evenings at the wittgenstein home with such viennese musicians of the day as johannes brahms , clara schumann , gustav mahler , bruno walter , and richard strauss .
when wittgenstein lost his right arm in world war i , josef labor was the first person he asked to write a piece for piano left hand . wittgenstein later commissioned works for the left hand from other composers including strauss , maurice ravel , benjamin britten , sergei prokofiev , and franz schmidt ( the finale of schmidt 's a major clarinet quintet - the last of his wittgenstein commissions - is a set of variations on a theme by labor from labor 's own clarinet and piano quintet , his opus 11 published in 1901 ) .
paul 's brother , the philosopher and writer ludwig wittgenstein , praised josef labor as one of `` the six truly great composers `` along with mozart , haydn , beethoven , schubert , and brahms .

== scientific career ==
hübner was the author of sammlung europäischer schmetterlinge ( 1796–1805 ) , a founding work of entomology . he was one of the first specialists to work on the european lepidoptera . he described many new species , for example sesia bembeciformis and euchloe tagis , many of them common . he also described many new genera and species .
he was a designer and engraver and from 1786 he worked for three years as a designer and engraver at a cotton factory in ukraine . there he collected butterflies and moths including descriptions and illustrations of some in beiträge zur geschichte der schmetterlinge ( 1786–1790 ) along with other new species from the countryside around his home in augsburg .
hübner 's masterwork `` tentamen `` was intended as a discussion document . inadvertently published , it led to subsequent confusion in classification . his publications were issued in sections , some after his death , often without associated publication dates . arthur francis hemming , secretary of the international commission on zoological nomenclature , summarized all the citations of hübner 's proposed taxonomic names , thereby constraining the possible dates of publication leading to the acceptance of hübner 's works as valid taxonomic publications .

philibert commerson ( french : [ filibɛʁ kɔmɛʁsɔ̃ ] ; 18 november 1727 – 14 march 1773 ) , sometimes spelled commerçon by contemporaries , was a french naturalist , best known for accompanying louis antoine de bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation in 1766–1769 .


== biography ==
commerson was born at châtillon-les-dombes in france . he studied in montpellier , and for a time was a practicing physician . he was in contact with carl linnaeus , who encouraged him to study fish of the mediterranean.commerson returned to live at châtillon-les-dombes , where he occupied himself in creating a botanical garden in 1758 . after the death of his wife in 1764 , he moved to paris.in 1766 , commerson joined bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation after being recommended for the position of naturalist by the paris academy of sciences . he had previously drawn up an extensive programme of nature studies for the marine ministry , in which he elaborated the `` three natural kingdoms `` which a naturalist should investigate on a voyage around the world . among the wildlife that commerson observed was a particular kind of dolphin in the strait of magellan , now known as commerson 's dolphin ( cephalorhynchus commersonii ) .commerson 's partner and assistant , jeanne baré , accompanied him on the voyage , disguised as a man . baré acted as a nurse to commerson , who was often ill , as well as assisting him in his scientific work . her gender was only publicly discovered while the expedition was at tahiti , but she remained with commerson , nursing him and assisting him in his professional activities until the end of his life.commerson was an astute observer of the tahitian people and culture , thanks in part to a remarkable lack of european prejudice compared to other early visitors to the island . commerson and bougainville together were responsible for spreading the myth of tahitians as the embodiment of the concept of the noble savage .
what admirable country madagascar is ! it would merit not a casual observer but entire academies . madagascar , i may announce to naturalists , is their promised land ; it is there that nature seems to have retreated as into a private sanctuary , to work on different models from any she has used elsewhere : the most curious , the most marvellous forms can be found at every step ...

commerson also studied and collected plants wherever the expedition stopped ; among others , he described the genus bougainvillea . on the return voyage to france in 1768 , he remained behind at mauritius ( the then-french isle de france ) , in order to botanize there and on madagascar , an island that fascinated him . pierre sonnerat , who would also become a renowned botanist , was his personal secretary on the isle de france .


== death and legacy ==
commerson died at mauritius at the age of 45 . his extensive collections from the voyage did not , unfortunately , receive their deserved recognition . although his numerous manuscripts and herbaria were brought to paris after his death they were never systematically organized and evaluated . unaware of his death in 1773 , the paris academy of sciences elected him as a fellow botanist just a few months later .

bowne was born on january 14 , 1847 , near leonardville in monmouth county , new jersey . in 1876 he became a professor of philosophy at boston university , where he taught for more than thirty years . he later served as the first dean of the graduate school . bowne was an acute critic of mechanistic determinism , positivism , and naturalism . he categorized his views as kantianized berkeleyanism , transcendental empiricism , and , finally , personalism , emphasizing freedom and the importance of the self , a philosophical branch of liberal theology : of this branch bowne is the dominant figure ; this personalism is sometimes called boston personalism , in contrast with the california personalism of george holmes howison . bowne 's magnum opus , metaphysics , was published in 1882 . bowne was chiefly influenced by hermann lotze . he died on april 1 , 1910 , in boston , massachusetts .


== legacy ==
bowne has influenced philosophy in various ways . for instance , there has been a direct line of personalists from bowne through his student , edgar sheffield brightman ( 1884–1954 ) , through brightman 's student , peter anthony bertocci ( 1910–1989 ) , to bertocci 's student , thomas o. buford ( born 1932 ) .
there has also been a more general influence , as with martin luther king jr. , who studied at boston university , and spoke in his stride toward freedom of having gained `` a metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human personality . `` bowne received nine nominations for the nobel prize in literature between 1906 and 1909—one from his own sister .

= georgios kleovoulos =
georgios kleovoulos ( greek : γεώργιος κλεόβουλος , philippopolis , c. 1785 - syros , july 28 , 1828 ) was a greek scholar and educator of the early 19th century . he was born in philippopolis ( present-day plovdiv ) , in the ottoman empire . he was a supporter of the mutual-teaching schools and one of the people who brought this teaching method to greece . he taught in iași , odessa , syros and poros and died on the 28 july 1828 in syros of pneumonia .


== biography ==
kleovoulos was born around 1785 , the son of a poor craftsman . at an early age he was adopted by the deacon of the metropolitan of philippopolis , makarios of patmos , who helped kleovoulos to study at patmiada school and then at the academy of kydonies ( ayvalik ) . there he studied alongside renowned scholars of the time such as benjamin of lesbos and grigorios of kydonies.he completed his studies with a distinguished performance and then lived for three years in vienna where , alongside his studies , he was teaching the greek language . he also studied in bavaria and later he visited switzerland where he became familiar with the mutual-teaching method practiced by johann heinrich pestalozzi and philipp emanuel von fellenberg . thrilled by this method of teaching , he went to france in order to learn how to use it and after his studies he became principal of a greek school in iasi in the danubian principalities ( 1819-1821 ) . from that school almost 100 students graduated and then moved to greece where they practiced the same method . until 1824 , kleovoulos used the mutual-teaching method at a school of the greek community in odessa as well.in 1825 kleovoulos went to the cyclades in greece , where the greek war of independence had broken out in 1821 . there , after fruitless efforts to create mutual-teaching schools in paros , naxos and tinos , he settled in syros where he taught the mutual-teaching method to the children of greek refugees who had found shelter on the island4 . in april 1828 , after an invitation of the governor of greece , ioannis kapodistrias , he was appointed principal at the exemplary school of poros . however , shortly after that , he caught pneumonia . he went to syros to take his family and return to poros , but in the meantime his health deteriorated and he died on 28 july .


== work ==
in 1820 , kleovoulos wrote an article which was published in hermes o logios that was one of the first systematic studies about the mutual-teaching method written in greek language . furthermore , he left handwritten notes on the interpretation and application of the method , which was used by a large number of greek teachers even after 1830 , when the greek translation of louis charles sarazin 's handbook was approved by the preparatory school commission `` .

william john young ( 26 january 1878 – 14 may 1942 ) was an english biochemist .


== beginnings and education ==
william john young was born on 26 january 1878 in withington , manchester , england . he received a b.sc . in 1898 and a m.sc . in 1902 at owen college , manchester . young began his research early in his career , and was granted the levinstein and dalton research exhibitions for 1899-1900 and 1900-1901 respectively .


== yeast fermentation experiment ==
from 1900-1912 young held the title of assistant biochemist at the lister institute of preventive medicine in london . here , he worked collaboratively with sir arthur harden on the mechanism of fermenting enzymes in yeast extract , work extending the earlier work of eduard buchner on cell-free alcoholic fermentation in 1906 they found that heat-stable substances additional to the heat-sensitive enzyme were necessary , by observing that the rate of alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts increased when boiled yeast extract was added . they soon discovered that salts of orthophosphoric acid stimulate that fermentation . they developed a superior apparatus to collect and measure the gases that evolved during alcohol fermentation . this model employed a volumetric measurement of co2 , while former apparatuses used a gravimetric measurement.using this new apparatus , arthur harden and young inadvertently discovered the sugar diphosphate in the system . that compound , which was coined the harden-young ester , was later shown to be fructose-1,6-diphosphate . this compound was the first chemical intermediate discovered in fermentation . its discovery led to the ultimate description of fermentation in terms of molecular intermediates . harden ’ s and young ’ s general findings can be summarized by the following equations :
2c6h12o6 + 2na2hpo4 = c6h10o4 ( po4na2 ) +2h2o + co2 +2c2h6o ;
c6h10o4 ( po4na2 ) 2 + h2o = c6h12o6 + 2na2hpo4in 1910 , young received his d.sc . from the university of london .


== research in australia ==
in 1913 , young and his family migrated to queensland , australia , where he was appointed biochemist at the australian institute of tropical medicine , townsville . in 1920 , young became a lecturer at the university of melbourne . he was promoted to associate professor in 1924 and foundation professor in 1938 . during these years , his interests were extended to applied biochemistry of food preservation . he was a forerunner in refrigeration techniques , and some of his methods are still being used with bananas.while in australia , young conducted several experiments related to the biochemistry of blood . in 1915 , he performed a set of experiments to compare the effects of salvarsan and neosalvarsan to the behavior of atoxyl in animal blood . he found that they were very similar to one another , and all led to a form of arsenic associated with blood proteins . this arsenic was found to be localized to the plasma and the red blood cells in the blood .
in response to previous studies of the anti-tryptic action of blood serum , young conducted a series of experiments in 1918 in which he investigated the possible mechanism of this anti-tryptic effect of the blood sera of various animals . his research led him to the tentative conclusion that trypsin was not a protein ( young 1915 , 1918 ) . in later research this conclusion was refuted . he did , however , provide valuable improvements to the techniques utilized in related research .
in 1920 , young embarked on an investigation of the pigment melanin found in the skin and hair of animals and humans ( young 1914 , 1921 ) . he found that it could be extracted by treatment with dilute alkali . this research provided him insight into the structure of melanin and its role in hair and skin .

peter artedi or petrus arctaedius ( 27 february 1705 – 28 september 1735 ) was a swedish naturalist who is known as the `` father of ichthyology `` .
artedi was born in anundsjö in the province of ångermanland . intending to become a clergyman , he went after schooling in harnosand , in 1724 , to study theology at uppsala university , but he turned his attention to medicine and natural history , especially ichthyology , a science that he influenced greatly . in 1728 his countryman carl linnaeus arrived in uppsala , and a lasting friendship was formed between the two from 1729 ( as artedi was away due to the death of his father ) . in 1732 both left uppsala , artedi for england , and linnaeus for lappland ; before parting they reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the event of death.in 1734 artedi visited england , mentioning a meeting with hans sloane and a whale in london in november downstream of the london bridge . artedi left london in summer 1735 and met linnaeus in leiden . artedi was short of money and linnaeus introduced him to albertus seba , a wealthy dutchman , who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum of his time in amsterdam . seba employed artedi to write descriptions of fishes for his thesaurus.on the night of 27 september , while returning from seba 's home to his lodgings , he accidentally fell and drowned in a canal . his body was found the next day . linnaeus heard of the death through claudius sohlberg two days later and rushed to amsterdam . according to agreement , his manuscripts came into the hands of linnaeus , and his bibliotheca ichthyologica and philosophia ichthyologica , together with a life of the author , were published at leiden in 1738 under the title `` ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus ... `` .artedi was buried in a pauper 's grave in st anthony 's churchyard in amsterdam on 2 october 1735 . his grave was never marked and the churchyard site has since been appropriated for other purposes . an epitaph , written in latin by anders celsius , and translated into english by george shaw , is known because it was inscribed on the back flyleaf of linnaeus 's own copy of `` ichthyologia `` :

here lies poor artedi , in foreign land pyx 'd
not a man nor a fish , but something betwixt ,
not a man , for his life among fishes he past ,
not a fish , for he perished by water at last.a memorial stone to peter artedi was erected in amsterdam zoological gardens and unveiled on 28 june 1905 ; it is inscribed in latin . other stone memorials are in anundsjö and nordmaling in sweden .
linnaeus named artedia ( apiaceae ) , a monotypic genus from the eastern mediterranean , after his friend .

allan macfadyen ( 26 may 1860 in glasgow – 1 march 1907 in hampstead , london ) was a scottish bacteriologist , a pioneer in immunization against bacterial infection .


== early life and education ==
the youngest of four sons of a brass founder in glasgow , macfadyen was the son of archibald macfadyen and wife margaret , who was a daughter of d. mckinlay of stornaway .
allan macfadyen was educated at dr. bryce 's collegiate school at edinburgh from 1871 . in 1878 he became a student in the university of edinburgh . he graduated there m.b . , c.m . ( 1883 ) , m.d . with gold medal ( 1886 ) , and b.sc . in hygiene ( 1888 ) . he studied chemistry and bacteriology in berne , göttingen , and munich .


== career ==
upon his return to england , he became , from 1889 to 1892 , a research scholar of the grocers ' company and lecturer on bacteriology at the college of state medicine in london . the college was subsequently amalgamated with the british institute of preventive medicine , of which macfadyen was made director in 1891 . ( in 1898 the british institute was renamed the jenner institute , and in 1903 the jenner institute was renamed the lister institute . )
in 1903 macfadyen was appointed secretary of the lister institute ’ s governing body as well as head of its bacteriological department . he was instrumental in planning and organising the present building of the lister institute on the chelsea embankment . he contracted typhoid fever in 1902 while engaged in investigating its bacillus . from 1901 to 1904 he was fullerian professor of physiology at the royal institution . in 1905 he resigned his official position at the royal institution to devote himself exclusively to original work .
macfadyen worked on endotoxins of certain bacteria , such as vibrio cholerae and salmonella enterica . to obtain these endotoxins macfadyen ground up bacteria , rendered brittle by freezing with liquid nitrogen to –190 °c . sir james dewar collaborated with him on the use of liquid nitrogen . macfadyen and dewar proved that some bacteria retain their bioactivity after freezing to –250 °c . macfadyen showed that injecting small doses of bacterial endotoxins into experimental animals made them immune to infection by the corresponding living bacteria . sydney donville rowland assisted him in much of the research on endotoxins .

= holbrook working =
holbrook working ( february 5 , 1895 – october 5 , 1985 ) was an american professor of economics and statistics at stanford university ’ s food research institute known for his contributions on hedging , on the theory of futures prices , on an early theory of market maker behavior , and on the theory of storage ( including the working curve which plots the difference between short term and long term grain futures prices against current inventory ) .


== biography ==
he was born in fort collins , colorado on february 5 , 1895 .
working earned his ph.d. in agricultural economics from the university of wisconsin–madison in 1921 . he taught at cornell university and the university of minnesota before he joined stanford 's food research institute in 1925 . his younger brother elmer working made a major contribution on the identification problem for demand curves in econometrics , with which holbrook working was also involved .
working disagreed with keynes ’ s backwardation theory of futures prices , which argued that short hedgers ( farmers ) drive down futures prices because of their demand for price insurance . working argued that there could be hedgers on both sides of the market and that hedging was essentially not a risk reduction technique , but `` speculation in the basis `` which allows informed traders and commodity dealers to profit from their knowledge of future changes in the difference between futures and spot prices .
he was a founding member of the econometric society and was elected a fellow of the american agricultural economics association , the american statistical association , and the american association for the advancement of science . in 1981 he was awarded the wilks memorial award by the american statistical association .
he died on october 5 , 1985 in santa clara , california .

his father was a ship captain , and he was born into a large family of 13 children . all the children worked to help make ends meet . farsund at that time had many seamen , small fishermen and chandlers . this provided his initial exposure to the ideas which he came to examine extensively later in his life : poverty , overpopulation and the work issues associated with the transition from an older farm culture to 19th century business and industry .

= matthias ho c3 ab von ho c3 abnegg =
matthias hoë von hoënegg ( 24 february 1580 , vienna – 4 march 1645 , dresden ) was a german lutheran pastor .


== life ==
matthias 's father was leonhard höe von höenegg , a lutheran imperial councillor and doctor of law descended from old austrian nobility . matthias was born prematurely and so his health was weak during his early years , meaning he only started speaking when he was seven . his father initially had him taught by a private tutor until , once he was almost fully educated , he was allowed to visit vienna 's st stephan 's stadtschule , where he developed remarkably and began talking to the city 's scholars .
due to the imminent capture of vienna in 1594 by the ottomans , matthias , his father and his brother moved to steyr , where they spent three years and where matthias attended the local gymnasium . his father then returned to vienna and recalled matthias , giving him a chance to attend the university of vienna , where he initially studied philosophy . on the recommendation of an envoy from saxony , on 16 june 1597 he moved to the university of wittenberg , where he studied philosophy and gained his master 's degree , toying with going into law but in the end deciding to study theology .
after several disputations and lectures in wittenberg , his father 's death in 1599 brought him back to vienna for a short time , before returning to wittenberg , where he gained his licentiate in theology in 1601 . in 1602 he travelled to dresden , where he aimed to become court-preacher to the prince elector . after a trial sermon on 17 february 1602 he gained the post and also graduated on 6 march 1604 as a doctor of theology in wittenberg . christian ii of saxony then sent him to plauen as superintendent , where on 20 april he was introduced to polykarp leyser the elder .
despite several offers of other posts , he remained in the service of saxony and in 1611 , at the request of the elector of saxony , moved to prague as director of protestant schools and churches in bohemia . he then moved back to dresden on the death of paul jenisch and replaced him as chief court preacher of saxony .
his most notable work is his two-volume commentarii in joannis apocalypsin ( leipzig 1610/40 ) . his sermons and writings were strong lutheran polemics against the reformed churches , whose beliefs he loathed more than counter-reformation catholicism . older literature on the topic has overestimated his influence on john george i of saxony and saxon policy at the start of the thirty years ' war , though he was on john george 's privy council when it approved siding with the emperor against frederick v and wrote propaganda to support that decision .

upon returning to brazil , he continued his experiments with spreading depression , in the department of physiology of the medical school of the university of brazil ( presently the federal university of rio de janeiro ) . already in 1947 he published his first international paper on a research developed entirely in his new brazilian lab , which was put together with great difficulty due to the lack of resources and specialized equipment . some of his lifelong colleagues , such as dr. hiss martins ferreira joined him at that time . in the intervening years he added a great number of his students to the group , such as drs . romualdo josé do carmo , gilberto de oliveira castro and others .
together with prof. carlos chagas filho ( 1910–2000 ) , another influential neurophysiologist and biophysicist , dr. leão founded the laboratory of biophysics , which later became the world-famous institute of biophysics , a great cradle of two generations of brazilian scientists and a center of excellence in neurophysiological research .

= edwin fischer =
edwin fischer ( 6 october 1886 – 24 january 1960 ) was a swiss classical pianist and conductor . he is regarded as one of the great interpreters of j.s . bach and ( particularly ) mozart of the twentieth century .


== biography ==
fischer was born in basel and studied music first there , and later in berlin at the stern conservatory under martin krause . he first came to prominence as a pianist following world war i . in 1926 , he became conductor of the lübeck musikverein and later conducted in munich . in 1932 he formed his own chamber orchestra , and was one of the first to be interested in presenting music of the baroque and classical periods in a historically accurate way . although his performances were not historically accurate by present-day standards , they were for his time ; e.g . , he did conduct bach and mozart concertos from the keyboard , an unusual practice at that time . his interpretations of bach and handel were romantically conceived , with a wide dynamic range but often quite compelling .
in 1932 he returned once again to berlin , succeeding his great contemporary artur schnabel in a teaching role at the berlin hochschule für musik after schnabel 's exile ( he was jewish , and fischer was not ) from nazi germany . in 1942 he moved back to switzerland , temporarily putting his career on hold through world war ii . after the war he began to perform again , and gave master classes in lucerne for a number of later prominent pianists such as alfred brendel , helena sá e costa , mario feninger , reine gianoli , paul badura-skoda and daniel barenboim .

as well as solo recitals , concerto performances and conducting , fischer performed much chamber music . particularly highly regarded was the piano trio he formed with the cellist enrico mainardi and the violinist georg kulenkampff , ( who was replaced by wolfgang schneiderhan after kulenkampff 's death ) .
fischer published a number of books on teaching , and one on the piano sonatas of beethoven . he also made a number of recordings , including the first complete bach well-tempered clavier for emi , recorded on the piano from 1933 to 1936 . other classic recordings by fischer include bach keyboard concertos , miscellaneous solo bach works such as the chromatic fantasy and fugue , various concertos and sonatas by mozart and beethoven , schubert 's `` wanderer `` fantasie ( although he was not up to the transcendental technical demands of the finale ) and impromptus , and beethoven 's `` emperor `` and brahms ' second concerto , both conducted by wilhelm furtwängler . fischer 's historically important recordings have been reissued on cd by emi and smaller specialty labels such as apr , music & arts , pearl and testament . those of the mozart concertos k. 453 , 466 , 482 , 491 & 503 ( g major , d minor , e-flat major , c minor and c major ) are particularly outstanding , especially the last three with the inspired , powerful conducting of john barbirolli , lawrance collingwood and josef krips respectively , in 1935 , 1937 & 1947 .
fischer also accompanied elisabeth schwarzkopf in a renowned early-to-mid-1950s emi lp of schubert lieder . his last musical collaboration was with the violinist gioconda de vito . during their recording sessions for the brahms violin sonatas nos . 1 and 3 , he had to go to london for medical treatment , where he was told he was seriously ill . he died shortly afterwards in zurich .

anna antoinette weber-van bosse ( 27 march 1852 – 29 october 1942 ) was a dutch phycologist , specializing in marine algae .


== life ==
her interest in botany and zoology started at a young age , inspired by regular trips to the amsterdam zoo . she attended university of amsterdam in 1880 , made to do her laboratory work in a room separate from the male students.some of her greatest work comes from the siboga expedition , considered the most important expedition for marine phycology in the western pacific for the nineteenth century . she ventured with her husband , max weber . these travels brought about numerous discoveries , including entire new genera of algae , such as periphykon , exophyllum , and microphyllum . much of her discoveries from this trip are documented in her monograph corallinaceae ( 1904 ) , and her four-volume liste des algues du siboga ( 1913-1928 ) .some of her discoveries came during earlier expeditions to northern norway and the east indies . she discovered the genus phytophysa and a form of symbiosis between algae and sponges before she left for siboga .
much of her later work was done in her small home laboratory huis eerbeek , where several botanists would visit for consultation . outside of marine biology , she worked with community child-care centers in amsterdam.she received several awards for her work , including one of the country 's highest honors , the chevalier de l'ordre d'orange-nassau , and an honorary doctorate from the university of utrecht . the bird species dicaeum annae was named in her honour . she died on october 29 , 1942 at the age of 90 .
an excerpt from dr. weber-van bosse ’ s the corallinaceae of the siboga - expedition :
“ the siboga had vainly tried to find a good anchorage on the east-side of saleyer : the night advanced rapidly and therefore commander tvdeman resolved to anchor for the night on the above named coral bank , where he was sure to find from 8—10 m. water . how great was our astonishment the next morning when coming on deck , we saw a distinct red colour at the bottom of the sea regularly interrupted by narrow white bands . it was no coral bank on which we were lying but an enormous bank of lithothamnia . that gave a red colour to the bottom of the sea , ” ( page 6 ) . published 1904 .

gaston frommel ( november 25 , 1862 in altkirch , france – may 18 , 1906 in geneva ) , french theologian , professor of theology in the university of geneva from 1894 to 1906 .
a frenchman by birth , his family fled alsace under german occupation in 1870 and he spent the rest of his life in switzerland . he may best be described as continuing the spirit of vinet amid the mental conditions marking the end of the 19th century .
like vinet , he derived his philosophy of religion from a peculiarly deep experience of the gospel of christ as meeting the demands of the moral consciousness ; but he developed even further than vinet the psychological analysis of conscience and the method of verifying every doctrine by direct reference to spiritual experience . both made much of moral individuality or personality as the crown and criterion of reality , believing that its correlation with christianity , both historically and philosophically , was most intimate . but while vinet laid most stress on the liberty from human authority essential to the moral consciousness , the changed needs of the age caused frommel to develop rather the aspect of man 's dependence as a moral being upon god 's spiritual initiative , `` the conditional nature of his liberty . `` `` liberty is not the primary , but the secondary characteristic `` of conscience ; `` before being free , it is the subject of obligation . `` on this depends its objectivity as a real revelation of the divine will .
thus he claimed that a deeper analysis carried one beyond the human subjectivity of even kant 's categorical imperative , since consciousness of obligation was `` une experience imposée sous le mode de l'absolu . `` by his use of imposée frommel emphasized the priority of man 's sense of obligation to his consciousness either of self or of god . here he appealed to the current psychology of the subconscious for confirmation of his analysis , by which he claimed to transcend mere intellectualism . in his language on this fundamental point he was perhaps too jealous of admitting an ideal element as implicit in the feeling of obligation . still he did well in insisting on priority to self-conscious thought as a mark of metaphysical objectivity in the case of moral , no less than of physical experience . further , he found in the christian revelation the same characteristics as belonged to the universal revelation involved in conscience , viz . , god 's sovereign initiative and his living action in history . from this standpoint he argued against a purely psychological type of religion ( agnosticisme religieux ; as he termed it ) -- a tendency to which he saw even in a sabatier and the symbolofidéisme of the paris school—as giving up a real and unifying faith . his influence on men , especially the student class , was greatly enhanced by the religious force and charm of his personality . finally , like vinet , he was a man of letters and a penetrating critic of men and systems .

otis dudley duncan ( december 2 , 1921 in nocona , texas – november 16 , 2004 , in santa barbara , california ) was `` the most important quantitative sociologist in the world in the latter half of the 20th century `` , according to sociologist leo goodman . his book the american occupational structure , which received the american sociological association 's sorokin award , documented how parents transmit their societal status to their children . duncan compiled his thoughts on the major issues of the field into notes on social measurement , which he considered his greatest work .
one of the most influential sociologists in history , otis dudley duncan was instrumental in transforming mainstream american sociology into a quantitatively based empirical social science in the second half of the twentieth century . his key scholarly contributions include the introduction of path analysis to sociology ; the measurement of occupational socioeconomic standing with an index ( duncan socioeconomic index ) ; the study of intergenerational occupational mobility ; the spatial analysis of residential patterns ; the application and advancement of log-linear models and rasch models for categorical social science data ; and a landmark treatise on social measurement ( duncan 1984 ) .
duncan ’ s best known work is a 1967 book that he coauthored with peter blau , the american occupational structure . based on quantitative analyses of the first large national survey of social mobility in the united states , the book elegantly depicts the process by which parents transmit their social standing to their children , particularly through affecting the children ’ s education . the book ’ s impact went far beyond its analyses of occupational mobility . using survey data and statistical techniques , it showed how an important sociological topic could be analyzed effectively and rigorously with appropriate quantitative methods . the work helped inspire a new generation of sociologists to pursue quantitative sociology . today a worldwide community of sociologists specializing in social stratification and social mobility still work on elaborating the blau-duncan model to include such additional factors as cognitive ability , race , and social context in studying the transmission of social standing from one generation to the next .
duncan retired in 1987 , taking up pursuits such as composing electronic music and computer graphics . in 2000 he joined his local humanist society which led him to publish new work on the prevalence of creationism , tolerance of atheists , support for euthanasia and other such issues .

= george bristow ( ornithologist ) =
george bristow ( 1863 – 14 april 1947 ) was an english taxidermist and gunsmith of st leonards-on-sea in the borough of hastings , east sussex , in the southeast of england .
he is chiefly remembered as the perpetrator of the long-running `` hastings rarities `` hoax , in which he succeeded in adding 29 species or subspecies of birds to the british list , and defrauded his clients of some £7000 for specimens on the basis that they were british .


== life ==
bristow served an apprenticeship in taxidermy before working in the family business , established in 1845 , at an unpretentious shop at 15 silchester road , st leonards-on-sea . from the 1890s until the 1930s much of his business involved the procurement of wild birds by himself and others to be made into display specimens or study skins for sale to ornithologists and collectors .


== the hastings rarities fraud ==

among the specimens sold by bristow were surprising numbers of birds which , though purported to have been shot locally , were considered either rare vagrants to the area or were new to the british list . although some ornithologists held doubts about the provenance of such specimens , it was not until 1962 , well after bristow 's death , that an article by the statistician john nelder in british birds , looking at the statistics of ornithological records from the hastings area , publicly cast doubt on many records , with the implication of extensive serial fraud . the resulting scandal was known as the hastings rarities affair , with bristow the central figure as the presumed perpetrator of the fraud . nelder estimated that specimens to the value of £7000 had been sold between 1892 and 1930 .

== cain-sargon theory ==
bristowe is most well known for her cain-sargon of akkad equation theory in her book sargon the magnificent ( 1927 ) . in this work bristowe reconstructs the ancient chronology of mesopotamia based on the cylinder of nabonidus . the cylinder dates naram-sin , son of sargon of accad , 3200 years before nabonidus , and so sargon to c. 3800 bc . this sharply contrasts with mainstream scholarship which dates sargon to the 23rd century bc . bristowe controversially defended the earlier dating from the cylinder , to then argue sargon was the biblical cain .
the cain-sargon theory is not at all popular with contemporary assyriologists , but has received support from british israelites and proponents of christian identity whose publishing houses reprinted bristowe 's work . a sequel was published by bristowe in 1950 entitled cain - an argument .

emerich coreth ( 10 august 1919 – 1 september 2006 ) was an austrian philosopher , jesuit and catholic priest . he is well known for his works on metaphysics and philosophical anthropology . a close associate of karl rahner , coreth is a renowned neo-thomist of 20th century . he was the rector of the university of innsbruck and the provincial of the austrian province of the society of jesus .


== philosophy ==
coreth specialises in metaphysics , philosophical anthropology , and history of philosophy . he is considered one of the philosophers who sought the creative recovery of thomas aquinas ' metaphysics through the transcendental method introduced by joseph maréchal . particularly , coreth and other theologians attempted to revive the metaphysics of realism ( aristotelian-thomistic metaphysics ) by addressing the failure of kantian philosophy using its presuppositions . one of coreth 's most important works was metaphysik where he wrote about the christian metaphysics of being so that it presented a completely transcendentally reformulated version . this book also refuted critics such as etienne gilson , who argued that transcendental turn among thomists can only lead to phenomenalism or idealism.coreth maintained that instead of having an objective , metaphysics only has a subjective function . here , metaphysics loses its foundation in being but coreth said that `` our a priori knowledge is metaphysical knowledge of being , which opens for us the absolute horizon of being as such . ``

= bonaventura cavalieri =
bonaventura francesco cavalieri ( latin : cavalerius ; 1598 – 30 november 1647 ) was an italian mathematician and a jesuate . he is known for his work on the problems of optics and motion , work on indivisibles , the precursors of infinitesimal calculus , and the introduction of logarithms to italy . cavalieri 's principle in geometry partially anticipated integral calculus .


== life ==
born in milan , cavalieri joined the jesuates order ( not to be confused with the jesuits ) at the age of fifteen and remained a member until his death . he studied theology in the monastery of san gerolamo in milan , and geometry at the university of pisa .
he published eleven books , his first being published in 1632 . he worked on the problems of optics and motion . his astronomical and astrological work remained marginal to these main interests , though his last book , trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua ( 1646 ) , was dedicated to the former .
he was introduced to galileo galilei through academic and ecclesiastical contacts . galileo exerted a strong influence on cavalieri encouraging him to work on his new method and suggesting fruitful ideas , and cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to galileo . galileo said of cavalieri , `` few , if any , since archimedes , have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry . `` he also benefited from the patronage of cesare marsili.cavalieri 's first book was lo specchio ustorio , overo , trattato delle settioni coniche , or the burning mirror , or a treatise on conic sections . in this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into parabolas , hyperbolas , and ellipses , and various combinations of these mirrors . the work was purely theoretical since the needed mirrors could not be constructed with the technologies of the time , a limitation well understood by cavalieri.inspired by earlier work by galileo , cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the method of indivisibles to calculus and published a treatise on the topic , geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota ( geometry , developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua , 1635 ) . in this work , an area is considered as constituted by an indefinite number of parallel segments and a volume as constituted by an indefinite number of parallel planar areas . such elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of cavalieri 's method . as an application , he computed the areas under the curves

bjørn håvard wiik ( born 17 february 1937 in bruvik , norway ; died 26 february 1999 in hamburg , germany ) was a norwegian elementary particle physicist , noted for his role on the experiment that produced the first experimental evidence for gluons and for his influential role on later accelerator projects . wiik was director of desy , in hamburg , germany , from 1993 until his death .


== biography ==
bjørn wiik lived in his home town bruvik until he began his physics studies at germany 's technische universität darmstadt . in 1965 , he got his doctorate degree there . two years later he began working at the stanford linear accelerator center in menlo park , california . in 1972 , wiik returned to germany , to the german electron synchrotron ( desy ) in hamburg where , four years later , he was appointed lead scientist .
in 1978 , wiik and his collaborators began using desy 's newly commissioned petra electron–positron storage ring to look for hard-gluon bremsstrahlung events that would provide experimental support for the existence and role of gluons in mediating strong interactions among quarks . wiik and his team soon observed and reported a type of event never described before : three particle-jets whose momenta lay in a plane . these results , widely believed to represent the after-effects of two quarks plus a gluon , were soon confirmed by many other groups . in 1995 , the european physical society awarded its prize for high energy and particle physics to four physicists representing the tasso collaboration ( paul söding , bjørn wiik , günter wolf , and sau lan wu ) for demonstrating the existence of the gluon.already during his stay at slac , wiik had proposed a new type of particle accelerator , which would be based on colliding a beam of protons with a beam of electrons . in 1980 , this idea took concrete form with the creation at desy of the hadron-electron ring facility hera ) . wiik was also responsible for proposing and overseeing the implementation of a superconducting linear accelerator for tera-electronvolt energies , tesla.wiik was chairman of the super proton synchrotron experiments committee ( spsc ) at cern from 1979-80 .

= thomas maria mamachi =
thomas maria mamachi ( december 4 , 1713 in chios – june 7 , 1792 in corneto , near montefiascone ) , was an italo-greek dominican theologian and historian .


== life ==
at the age of sixteen he entered the convent of chios and passed later to st. mark 's at florence and the minerva at rome .
in 1740 he was appointed professor of physics in the roman sapienza university , and in 1743 taught philosophy at the propaganda fide . his residence at florence and rome brought him into contact with brilliant men of his order , e.g . giuseppe agostino orsi , divelli and daniello concina , and greatly facilitated his progress in his studies . he collaborated with orsi in his `` de romani pontificis in synodos oecumenicas et earum canones potestate `` .
soon pope benedict xiv appointed him prefect of the casanatensian library , master of theology and consultor of the congregation of the index . owing to his office he had to take part in the controversy between the appellants ( jansenists ) and the jesuits , and displayed an impartiality which greatly increased the difficulties of his anxious and laborious position . he engaged in lively theological controversies with gian domenico mansi and cadonici .
he had likewise to intervene in the controversy concerning the beatification of juan de palafox y mendoza . in a published writing on this question , he dealt severely with the jesuit party who opposed the beatification ; but he was not less energetic in dealing with their opponents , the appellants and jansenist church of utrecht .
he was director of the ecclesiastical journal of rome ( 1742–85 ) , and established at his residence a reunion of the learned roman society .
mamachi was a zealous supporter of the power of the roman pontiff . involved in all the controversy of the day , he was one of the first to take issue with johannes nicolaus von hontheim ( febronius ) . pius vi made him secretary of the index ( 1779 ) and afterwards master of the sacred palace , and frequently availed himself of his advice and of his pen .


== writings ==
mamachi 's great work was to have been his `` christian antiquities `` , but his labours in the field of dogma and jurisprudence absorbed so much of his time that he published only four of the twenty books that he planned . moreover , he lived in an age when the good method inaugurated by antonio bosio had been abandoned and , considered as an archaeological work , the synthesis which he had projected is valueless . a second edition , however , appeared in 1842-1851 .
his chief writings are :

`` de ratione temporum athanasiorum deque aliquot synodis iv saeculo celebratis `` ( florence , 1748 )
`` originum et antiquitatum christianarum libri xx `` ( 4 volumes rome , 1749–55 )
`` dei costumi dei primitivi cristiani `` ( 3 volumes rome , 1753 sqq . )

he died in santa monica , california on april 14 , 1947 ) . he is buried in forest lawn memorial park in glendale .


== career ==
tracy sonneborn would later write : jennings was so struck by the continued production of hereditarily diverse clones at conjugation , even after many successive inbreedings , that he undertook to examine the matter mathematically . as a result , general formulae for the results of diverse systems of mating were published in a series of papers between 1912 and 1917 ; these were one of the main seeds from which the whole field of mathematical genetics developed .
in 1924 , jennings published an article in scientific monthly on `` heredity and environment `` which was prescient for anticipating the double helix , and provocatively liberal for its comments on racial differences and american immigration policy.jennings was the recipient of the inaugural 1925 leidy award of the academy of natural sciences of philadelphia.after complaints about the documentary titled the hereditarily diseased , the carnegie institution of washington appointed jennings to review the work of harry h. laughlin at the institution 's eugenics record office , then part of what has become the cold spring harbor laboratory . jennings found falsified data and manipulated conclusions , and laughlin was forced out . in 1930 , he published the biological basis of human nature , discussing eugenics , genetic influence on human traits , and criticizing simplistic interpretations of heritability based on mendelism , emphasizing gene-environment interaction & polygenicity ; sonneborn would describe the impact of the biological basis of human nature as widespread : `` probably no book by a geneticist has been so widely quoted by american workers in the fields of education , sociology , anthropology , and psychology . in spite of inevitable misquotation and misinterpretation , it has exercised a distinctly salutary effect on those fields and is to a large extent responsible for whatever they have assimilated in this country from modern genetics . ``

he became interested at an early age in nature and insects , and especially beetles ( coleoptera ) caught his interest . during his stay in australia , he caught beetles on his travels to various places on the continent and in the light of powerful arc lamps ( the light trap technique ) . electric light was quite new at that time , and insects are attracted to light . this made a great impression , and newspapers often printed long articles about the phenomenon . the number of beetles fischer captured was far lower than other groups such as butterflies and moths , which are attracted to light sources . his collection included about 3,500 species , but this was only a fraction of the total species available . he stated that `` being an entomologist in australia was like being a cow in a meadow of clover . `` in 1925 , fischer had to leave australia due to health problems , and he moved back to norway . he still had contact with australian entomologists and he organized his large collection of australian beetles . his large beetle collection and specialized literature can be found in the insect collection at the natural history museum in oslo today . at the time it was assembled , this collection was of a size that few other museums outside australia had . he shared some of his experiences in an article in the norwegian journal of entomology.fischer created many illustrations of insects in his diaries between 1900 and 1904 . during his stay in australia , fischer suffered from spanish flu and then pneumonia , forcing him to return to norway . he died on february 8 , 1930 , after a long illness .

eduard lassen ( 13 april 1830 – 15 january 1904 ) was a belgian-danish composer and conductor . although of danish birth , he spent most of his career working as the music director at the court in weimar . a moderately prolific composer , lassen produced music in a variety of genres including operas , symphonic works , piano works , lieder , and choral works among others . his most successful pieces were his fine vocal art songs for solo voice and piano which often used elements of german and belgian folk music .


== biography ==
he was born in copenhagen , but was taken as a child to brussels and educated at the brussels conservatory where he earned prizes for piano ( 1844 ) and composition ( 1847 ) . he won the prix de rome in 1851 , which provided him with the opportunity to make a long tour in germany and italy . while touring he met louis spohr and franz liszt and composed much of his first opera le roi edgard . after returning to brussels in 1855 , lassen actively sought to get his opera performed but was unable to do so . liszt , however , agreed to produce the opera at the grossherzogliches theater ( now the staatskapelle weimar ) and the work premiered in weimar in 1857 . the following year , liszt recommended lassen as his replacement as the court music director in weimar , which involved conducting both the opera and the court orchestra . he happily took the job and remained in that role until his retirement in 1895 . while there he conducted several world premieres including the first performance of camille saint-saëns 's samson et dalila in 1877 . he also conducted the first performance in weimar , and the first outside munich , of wagner 's tristan und isolde ( 1874 ) .he remained in weimar after his retirement and died there in 1904 , shortly after receiving an honorary doctorate from the university of jena .


== works ==
a moderately prolific composer , lassen produced four operas , a significant amount of instrumental music to stage plays , two symphonies ( in d major , performed 1867/published 1868 and c major , op . 78 , published 1884 ) , a violin concerto in d major , op.87 ( 1888 ) , a festival march for symphony orchestra , two overtures , and 11 character pieces for piano . he also produced a significant amount of choral music , lieder , and art songs for voice and piano.lassen 's operas , landgraf ludwig 's brautfahrt ( 1857 ) , frauenlob ( 1861 ) , and le captif ( 1868 ) , did not have lasting success , though his music to goethe 's faust ( 1876 ) gained popularity and was praised by franz liszt . his incidental music to hebbel 's die nibelungen ( 1873 ) was also well known . in 1878-79 , liszt combined excerpts from both these works in a single piano transcription , aus der musik zu hebbels nibelungen und goethes faust ( s.496 ) .
lassen 's solo songs and duets show a variety of treatment from the folklike sei nur ruhig , lieber robin or the songs with dance rhythms to the through-composed abendlandschaft ( with its more interesting modulations and accompaniment ) to the rhapsodic and improvisatory ich hab im traum geweinet . many of his songs , for instance vöglein wohin so schnell , were translated into both english and french and were popular at the end of the 19th century .

andré martineau ( born 14 may 1930 – 4 may 1972 ) was a french mathematician , specializing in mathematical analysis .
martineau studied at the école normale supérieure and received there , with laurent schwartz as supervisor , his ph.d. with a thesis on analytic functionals and then worked for several years with schwartz . martineau became a professor at the university of nice sophia antipolis . shortly before his 42nd birthday , he died of cancer.his research deals with analysis in several complex variables , where he introduced fourier-borel transformations for analytic functionals . ( for one complex variable this type of functional transformation was introduced by émile borel . ) martineau was one of the early advocates of the theory of sato 's hyperfunctions and gave lectures on this topic in seminar bourbaki during 1960–1961 . according to pierre cartier , martineau played a role in the development of the concept of schemes in algebraic geometry by means of a remark made to jean-pierre serre.consider a quotation from the year 2004 :

a set in complex euclidean space is called c-convex if all its intersections with complex lines are contractible , and it is said to be linearly convex if its complement is a union of complex hyperplanes . these notions are intermediate between ordinary geometric convexity and pseudoconvexity . their importance was first manifested in the pioneering work of andré martineau from about forty years ago . since then a large number of new results have been obtained by many different mathematicians .
martineau was an invited speaker at the international congress of mathematicians in 1962 in stockholm with talk croissance d´une fonction entiers de type exponentiel et supports des fonctionelles analytiques and in 1970 in nice with talk fonctionelles analytiques . his doctoral students include henri skoda .

in addition to `` funiculì , funiculà `` , denza composed hundreds of popular songs . some of them , such as `` luna fedel `` , `` occhi di fata `` , and `` se `` , have been sung by enrico caruso , mario lanza , carlo bergonzi , luciano pavarotti , and ronan tynan . he was also an able mandolinist and guitarist , and for these instruments he wrote such compositions as `` ricordo di quisisana `` , `` come to me `` , `` nocturne `` , and several others . denza also wrote an opera , wallenstein ( 1876 ) .

kunitz was born in slonim ( then part of russia , now in belarus ) on december 19 , 1887 . he was raised and educated there until his move to the united states , where he settled in new york city in 1909 and became an american citizen in 1915 . kunitz graduated from cooper union with a degree in chemistry in 1916 and then enrolled there for graduate school in electrical engineering . after three years in the program , he moved to columbia university , from which he received a ph.d. in biological chemistry in 1924 . kunitz began work as a technical assistant in jacques loeb 's laboratory at rockefeller university in 1913 and continued there throughout his graduate years . loeb arranged for kunitz to receive a staff appointment at rockefeller after graduation .


== academic career ==
kunitz ' position at rockefeller was originally secured by jacques loeb . after loeb died in 1924 , john h. northrop succeeded him and retained kunitz ' position ; the two would collaborate extensively on experiments involving protein crystallization for much of their remaining careers . both northrop and kunitz moved to rockefeller 's princeton , new jersey campus in 1926 ; kunitz returned to new york city in 1952 . he then assumed professor emeritus status but continued to work regularly in the laboratory until eventually retiring in 1970.kunitz was awarded the carl neuberg medal in 1957 in recognition of his long research career and noted technical skill in the laboratory , which was critical to his long series of successes in protein crystallization . he was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1967 .


== research ==
kunitz is best known for his efforts in protein crystallization , successfully crystallizing a number of enzymes and enzyme precursor proteins , particularly proteases . kunitz worked with trypsin and chymotrypsin and their precursors , as well as pepsin . he also studied protease inhibitors and devoted particular effort to the soybean trypsin inhibitor ; the inhibitor protein , its domain family , and a soybean cultivar lacking this protein are all named after him . for their role in isolating , purifying , and crystallizing enzymes - a subject underscored by kunitz ' work with northrop - john h. northrop , wendell m. stanley , and james b. sumner were awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1946 . kunitz himself was nominated three times for a share of a nobel for this work.in addition to his work on crystallization of proteases , kunitz also performed careful work in enzymology , characterizing the kinetics and thermodynamics of protease reactions . he worked on other proteins as well , in particular ribonucleases , which were popular model systems for their small size and ease of crystallization . during world war ii he worked on government-assigned crystallization projects and was noted for the facility with which he crystallized hexokinase . kunitz was widely recognized specifically for his craftsmanship and technical skill in the laboratory .

= peter stoner =
peter stoner ( june 16 , 1888 – march 21 , 1980 ) was chairman of the departments of mathematics and astronomy at pasadena city college until 1953 ; chairman of the science division , westmont college , 1953–57 ; professor emeritus of science , westmont college ; professor emeritus of mathematics and astronomy , pasadena city college .
stoner is probably best known for his book science speaks that discusses , among other things , bible prophecies vis a vis probability estimates and calculations . the work is often cited in the field of christian apologetics in regard to bible prophecy . professor stoner 's book became widely known when it was mentioned by josh mcdowell in his 1972 book evidence that demands a verdict ( revised as new evidence that demands a verdict ) .


== american scientific affiliation ==
peter stoner was a co-founder of the american scientific affiliation , a christian organization that describes itself as `` a fellowship of men and women in science and disciplines that relate to science who share a common fidelity to the word of god and a commitment to integrity in the practice of science . `` the foreword to stoner 's science speaks includes a partial endorsement from this body ( covering the book 's scientific content and prophecy probability calculations , but not addressing issues of biblical exegesis or historical accuracy ) : they considered it `` ... in general , to be dependable and accurate in regard to the scientific material presented `` and the probability material presented in regard to prophecy . while the asa includes members with a diverse range of attitudes towards science ( theistic evolutionists , intelligent design advocates , old-earth creationists and young-earth creationists ) , stoner himself was apparently an old-earth creationist .


== criticism ==
c. p. swanson , reviewing science speaks in the quarterly review of biology , wrote : `` ... the author has fallen into the commonest error of using only these facts which bolster his hypothesis , and of discarding or controverting those which do not . for example , his discussion of the theory of evolution is not only misleading ; it displays an abysmal ignorance of recent evolutionary studies . `` various critics have taken issue with stoner 's interpretation of prophecy . stoner 's apologetic work did not receive critical attention until its inclusion in josh mcdowell 's evidence that demands a verdict and criticism of these claims tends to be addressed to mcdowell rather than stoner , with stoner 's name mentioned in passing . these criticisms against mcdowell , stoner and others include historical errors , claims regarding after-the-event authorship and/or tampering with biblical prophecies , and disputed meanings of certain biblical phrases .
others who disagree with specific claims made by stoner include fellow christians and secular historians : for instance , while stoner says of ezekiel 's prophecy of the permanent destruction of tyre `` if ezekiel had looked at tyre in his day and had made these seven predictions in human wisdom , these estimates mean that there would have been only one chance in 75,000,000 of their all coming true . they all came true in the minutest detail `` , others claim that `` the problem is that very little of this actually came to pass ! in fact , it badly missed how history actually unfolded `` and `` the location of the city of tyre is not in doubt , for it exists to this day on the same spot and is known as sur . `` however , it could still be argued that the boundaries of the ancient mainland city may have fallen within areas of the modern city not rebuilt in the present day .

eugenio fojo y márquez ( born 1899 ; date of death unknown ) was a spanish rose breeder who founded `` la florida `` in northern spain and the basque country . it was the most influential plant nursery and garden design firm in the 1930s . his rose , 'irene churruca , ' is still sold as one of the classic roses of that era .


== biography ==
fojo was born in cuba in 1899 while his father was in the spanish colonial army there . however , he grew up in the basque country of northern spain . when he was 25 , fojo became an apprentice in catalonia under simon dot and his son pedro dot , the famous rose breeder . pedro eventually named a rose after eugenio . fojo studied in england , italy , the united states , switzerland and germany before returning to set up a business in bilbao , spain . probably using capital provided by aristocratic and well-heeled patrons , fojo started `` la florida `` , a plant nursery , landscape design firm , and rose hybridizing enterprise which became very successful.fojo himself took a modest view of his rose breeding :

i have done no more , if i may say so , than bits and pieces . i 'm not a hybridiser of the highest class , but i am proud to place my creations alongside those of my friends , who are among the highest achievers .


== roses ==
friera 's rosas de españa lists fojo roses in the order they were introduced : `` his first rose was created in 1932 and was of course named 'la florida ' after his nursery . it was of a distinct salmon colour and earned him a diploma of merit in barcelona ’ s rose competition held in pedralbes . following this , in 1933 , he named 'villa de bilbao ' after his beloved city . in the same year , he created 'serafina longa ' . and in 1934 , produced 'irene churruca ' , which , with great triumph , won the floral gold medal , also in barcelona . in 1935 , he created 'señora de león aujuria ' , not a rose anyone cares for . 'monte igueldo ' came out in 1944 , 'condesa de benahavis ' in 1949 which was very pleasing and is considered a perfect rose . it had an attractive shade of salmon pink , excellent perfume , and displayed continuous flowering . after this came 'gloria de grado ' ( 1950 ) , and finally one called 'marquesa de narros ' . `` 'marquesa de narros ' is sometimes wrongly masculinised as 'marques de narros ' .
la florida also issued 'embajador lequerica ' — `` flowers strawberry-pink , reverse indian yellow at base passing to brick-red at edge `` – in 1962.of these roses , 'irene churruca ' ( usually listed in anglophone sources as 'golden melody ' ) remains the one most admired and most widely grown . it is on the list of the californian nursery vintage gardens as :

`` large petals of pale creamy buff shade to golden apricot at the heart . a flower of immense beauty and complex fragrance . a great , lost classic … `` 'irene churruca ' is in the carla fineschi foundation rose garden in italy ; the europarosarium sangerhausen in north germany ; at mottisfont abbey in england ; in the australian national collection at renmark and many others .

jacob leupold ( 22 july 1674 – 12 january 1727 ) was a german physicist , mathematician , instrument maker , mining commissioner and engineer . he wrote the seminal book theatrum machinarum generale ( `` the general theory of machines `` ) .


== early life ==
jacob leupold built many instruments needed for experimental physics studies . in 1699 leupold 's interests had fully changed to mechanics and mathematics .


== working life ==
in 1701 leupold obtained a position as an economist in george military hospital , thus ensuring a regular income but not enough free time to dedicate himself to mechanics .

in the 17th century , the main instruments for experimental physics were the telescope , the microscope , the pendulum clock and the vacuum pump , invented in 1656 by otto von guericke . leupold is also credited as an early inventor of air pump . he designed his first pump in 1705 , in 1707 he published a book `` antlia pneumatica illustrata `` . in 1711 following the advice of its president g. w. leibniz , the prussian academy of sciences acquired leupold 's pump . in 1715 leupold became a member of academy . in 1720 leupold started to work on the manuscript of theatrum machinarum . it was the first systematic analysis of mechanical engineering . it included , ahead of its time , a design for a high-pressure non-condensing steam engine , the likes of which were not built until the early 19th century .
theatrum machinarum consists of 10 illustrated volumes . it was published in leipzig between 1724-1739 .


== personal life ==
he married anna elizabeth and they had three sons and three daughters who all died young except for one daughter . his wife died in 1713 . leupold died on 12 january 1727 at age 53 .

= vincent contenson =
vincent contenson ( born at altivillare ( gers ) , diocese of condon , 1641 ; died creil-sur-oise , 26 december 1674 ) was a french dominican theologian and preacher .
his epitaph in the church of that place described him as `` in years a youth , mature in wisdom and in virtue venerable `` . despite his short life , he gave proof in his writings of considerable learning and won remarkable popularity by his pulpit utterances .
he was seventeen years old when he entered the order of preachers . after teaching philosophy for a time at albi , and theology at toulouse , he began a career of preaching as brilliant as it was brief . he was stricken in the pulpit at creil , where he was giving a mission .


== works ==
his reputation as a theologian rests on a work entitled theologia mentis et cordis , published posthumously at lyons in nine volumes , 1681 ; second edition , 1687 . the peculiar merit of his theology consists in an attempt to get away from the prevailing dry reasoning of scholasticism and , while retaining the accuracy and solidity of its method , to embellish it with illustrations and images borrowed from the church fathers , that appeal to the heart as well as the mind .

= gian-carlo rota =
gian-carlo rota ( april 27 , 1932 – april 18 , 1999 ) was an italian-american mathematician and philosopher .


== early life and education ==
rota was born in vigevano , italy . his father , giovanni , a prominent antifascist , was the brother of the mathematician rosetta , who was the wife of the writer ennio flaiano . gian-carlo 's family left italy when he was 13 years old , initially going to switzerland .
rota attended the colegio americano de quito in ecuador , and earned degrees at princeton university and yale university .


== career ==
much of rota 's career was spent as a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) , where he was and remains the only person ever to be appointed professor of applied mathematics and philosophy . rota was also the norbert wiener professor of applied mathematics .
in addition to his professorships at mit , rota held four honorary degrees , from the university of strasbourg , france ( 1984 ) ; the university of l'aquila , italy ( 1990 ) ; the university of bologna , italy ( 1996 ) ; and brooklyn polytechnic university ( 1997 ) .
beginning in 1966 he was a consultant at los alamos national laboratory , frequently visiting to lecture , discuss , and collaborate , notably with his friend stanisław ulam . he was also a consultant for the rand corporation ( 1966–71 ) and for the brookhaven national laboratory ( 1969–1973 ) . rota was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1982 , was vice president of the american mathematical society ( ams ) from 1995–97 , and was a member of numerous other mathematical and philosophical organizations.he taught a difficult but very popular course in probability . he also taught applications of calculus , differential equations , and combinatorial theory . his philosophy course in phenomenology was offered on friday nights to keep the enrollment manageable . among his many eccentricities , he would not teach without a can of coca-cola , and handed out prizes ranging from hershey bars to pocket knives to students who asked questions in class or did well on tests.rota began his career as a functional analyst , but switched to become a distinguished combinatorialist . his series of ten papers on the `` foundations of combinatorics `` in the 1960s is credited with making it a respectable branch of modern mathematics . he said that the one combinatorial idea he would like to be remembered for is the correspondence between combinatorial problems and problems of the location of the zeroes of polynomials . he worked on the theory of incidence algebras ( which generalize the 19th-century theory of möbius inversion ) and popularized their study among combinatorialists , set the umbral calculus on a rigorous foundation , unified the theory of sheffer sequences and polynomial sequences of binomial type , and worked on fundamental problems in probability theory . his philosophical work was largely in the phenomenology of edmund husserl .


== death ==
rota died of atherosclerotic cardiac disease , apparently in his sleep at his home in cambridge , massachusetts . he died just a few days short of his 67th birthday . his death was discovered after he failed to arrive in philadelphia for lectures he had planned to present beginning on monday 19 april 1999 .

== biography ==
alexander siloti was born on his father 's estate near kharkiv , ukraine ( then part of imperial russia ) . he studied piano at the moscow conservatory with nikolai zverev from 1871 , then from 1875 under nikolai rubinstein , brother of the more famous anton rubinstein ; from that year he also studied counterpoint under sergei taneyev , harmony under pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky , and theory under nikolai hubert . he graduated with the gold medal in piano in 1881 . siloti went to weimar , germany to further his studies with franz liszt , co-founding the liszt-verein in leipzig , and making his professional debut on 19 november 1883 . returning to russia in 1887 , siloti taught at the moscow conservatory , where his students included alexander goldenweiser , leonid maximov , and his first cousin sergei rachmaninoff . during this period he also began work as editor for tchaikovsky , particularly on the first and second piano concertos.siloti married vera tretyakova , herself a pianist and the daughter of wealthy industrialist and art collector pavel tretyakov . he left his post at the conservatory in may 1891 , and from 1892-1900 lived and toured in europe with his wife and young children . he also toured new york city , boston , cincinnati and chicago in 1898 . as a conductor siloti gave the world premiere of rachmaninoff 's piano concerto no . 2 with the composer as soloist in 1901 . from 1901-1903 , he led the moscow philharmonic ; from 1903-1917 , he organized , financed , and conducted the influential siloti concerts in st petersburg , collaborating with the critic and musicologist alexander ossovsky . he presented leopold auer , pablo casals , feodor chaliapin , george enescu , josef hofmann , wanda landowska , willem mengelberg , felix mottl , arthur nikisch , arnold schoenberg and felix weingartner , and local and world premieres by debussy , elgar , glazunov , prokofiev , rachmaninoff , rimsky-korsakov , scriabin , sibelius , stravinsky and others . ballet impresario sergei diaghilev first heard stravinsky 's music at one of the siloti concerts .
in the generation prior to 1917 , siloti was one of russia 's most important artists , with music by arensky , liszt , rachmaninoff , stravinsky and tchaikovsky dedicated to him . in 1918 , siloti was appointed intendant of the mariinsky theatre , but late the following year fled what had become soviet russia for england , finally settling in new york city in december 1921 . from 1925-1942 he taught at the juilliard school , performing occasionally in recital , and in november 1930 gave a legendary all-liszt concert with arturo toscanini . his many students included bertha melnik , marc blitzstein , gladys ewart , and eugene istomin .
siloti , who was one of the great practitioners of the art of transcription , wrote over 200 of these arrangements , as well as orchestral editions of the music of bach , beethoven , liszt , tchaikovsky and vivaldi . possibly his most famous transcription is the prelude in b minor , based on a keyboard prelude by j. s. bach . as a pianist siloti made 8 piano rolls and 26 minutes of home-recorded discs . carl fischer has published a large anthology of his piano transcriptions , and rowman and littlefield has published the first full-scale alexander siloti biography . in 2014 , the alexander siloti archive at stanford university was donated by author and alumnus charles barber . in six linear feet , it contains all of the correspondence , documentation , music and manuscripts acquired for the writing of the siloti biography called lost in the stars , and for publication of the 'alexander siloti collection ' of piano music .
alexander siloti is buried at the russian orthodox convent novo-diveevo cemetery , nanuet , new york .

= william cunnington =
william cunnington fsa ( 1754 – 31 december 1810 ) was an english antiquarian and archaeologist .
cunnington was a self-educated merchant , who developed an interest in the rich archaeological landscape around the wiltshire village of heytesbury where he lived and worked . in contrast to the vast majority of antiquarians of the time , cunnington realised that to fully understand the barrows which fascinated him , they should be excavated and recorded carefully and methodically . beginning his work around 1798 , the initial investigations were self-funded , but increasingly they attracted the interest of a succession of wealthy patrons including h.p . wyndham mp ( whose sister laetitia lived at heytesbury house ) and culminating in sir richard colt hoare ( 1758–1838 ) of stourhead.hoare ’ s substantial financial investment in cunnington ’ s work from 1804 , and the consequent increase in the number of excavations undertaken , enabled the latter to excavate several hundred barrows across south wiltshire . by modern standards , cunnington ’ s excavation methodology – predominantly involving a shaft trench dug from the crown of a barrow to ground level in search of `` novelties `` – was poor , but he was the first archaeologist to undertake such an extensive campaign of work and was a true pioneer . it was not until the work of thomas bateman ( 1821–61 ) in derbyshire in the 1840s , that large scale excavations saw a significant step forward in methodology .
stephen and john parker , also of heytesbury , worked on nearly all of cunnington ’ s excavations up to 1810 and were held in some esteem as reliable , careful and experienced excavators . john parker is more frequently discussed in correspondence between cunnington and hoare and it is clear that he was often despatched on travels across the wiltshire downs in search of new sites . john , born in 1780 , is portrayed with some warmth by cunnington and he comes across as hard-working and enthusiastic , being deeply disappointed by the failure of excavations to produce interesting material . recent research by paul everill has revealed the first reference to the use of a trowel on an archaeological site in a letter from cunnington to hoare in 1808 , which describes john parker using one in the excavation of bush barrow.along with richard colt hoare , cunnington was the subject of an exhibition at the wiltshire museum in 2003 . the museum holds the archives made by cunnington , along with watercolour drawings made by philip crocker and the objects that he excavated .

he managed to identify microglia between 1919 and 1921 by staining the cells with silver carbonate . his method of staining also led to the discovery of oligodendroglia in 1921 , which both he and penfield are now credited with . however it was rio hortega who named the cells.his discoveries in 1920 created issues with ramón y cajal , who led the lab , as he had earlier won the nobel prize . by 1931 del río hortega was leading spain 's cancer institute , but he left the country when the civil war broke out in 1936.war spreading across europe found him in paris at the pitié-salpêtrière hospital before he went to the university of oxford to work with the british neurosurgeon hugh cairns . the bombing of britain by germany in world war ii drove him on to argentina . his escape was funded by the spanish cultural institute , who continued to support him as he created his own laboratory in 1942 . río hortega died in buenos aires on 1 june 1945 from a malignant neoplasm .

== biography ==
rouben abrahamian was born as ṛubēn tʻadēosi abrahamyan in 1881 in the village of gnishik in the vayots dzor province of armenia ( then part of the russian empire ) . he received his secondary education in etchmiadzin and yerevan , and then moved abroad for higher education in a number of places . first , he studied at the faculty of history and philology at the kiev university ( 1907 ) , then at leipzig university ( 1909 ) , and then at the saint petersburg state university ( 1911 ) . after his academic spell in europe , he returned and started teaching russian , linguistics , and classical philosophy in yerevan . between 1912 and 1921 , he taught in tiflis ( tbilisi ) , as well as at other schools in the caucasus region . in 1921 , he moved to neighboring iran and taught for many years at various armenian schools in tabriz , new julfa , and tehran .
during his time in tehran , as the encyclopaedia iranica states , abrahamian served as the principal of a large armenian school . at the same time , he also began his study of ancient and modern persian . some time later , he once again travelled to europe for educational matters , and in 1935 , he received his doctorate in philology from the sorbonne university in paris ( nowadays university of paris ) . he wrote his graduation thesis on the judeo-persian dialects of judeo-isfahani and judeo-hamadani . as his biographer jennifer manoukian mentions , his interest for this topic stemmed from the time he translated the works of the 11th-century iranian poet baba tahir into armenian . abrahamian 's work on this matter was pivotal , for he found important commonalities between the language used in baba tahir ’ s poems and the jewish dialects of the iranian cities of hamadān and isfahan . his findings on behalf of baba tahir and the jewish dialects were published in the following year under the title of dialectologie iranienne : dialectes des israélites de hamadan et d ’ ispahan et dialecte de baba tahir .
when the university of tehran was founded in 1935 , abrahamian participated actively in the establishment of its department of ancient iranian languages , where he subsequently started teaching pahlavi and became head of the faculty as well . in 1946 , following the iran crisis of 1946 , he moved to soviet armenia , where he worked at the institute of languages at the academy of sciences in yerevan .

in 1932 , merle randall authored two scientific papers with mikkel frandsen : “ the standard electrode potential of iron and the activity coefficient of ferrous chloride , ” and “ determination of the free energy of ferrous hydroxide from measurements of electromotive force . ”


== education ==
randall completed his ph.d. at the massachusetts institute of technology in 1912 with a dissertation on “ studies in free energy ” .


== related ==
based on work by j. willard gibbs , it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an equilibrium determined by the free energy of the substances taking part . using this theory , gilbert lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances . in 1923 , he and randall published the results of this study and formalizing chemical thermodynamics .
according to the belgian thermodynamicist ilya prigogine , their influential 1923 textbook led to the replacement of the term “ affinity ” by the term “ free energy ” in much of the english-speaking world .

in 1938 he took a post to teach physics at repton school , but when war broke out he joined the armament research department at woolwich arsenal as a scientific officer . there he worked on problems related to ammunition , some of which involved the use of high-speed photography . he was later transferred to fort halstead in kent to work in the theoretical physics division on the analysis of shockwaves .
at the end of war in 1945 he moved to bristol to work at the h.h . wills physical laboratory of the university of bristol . after a period studying deposited metal surfaces , he took the opportunity in 1948 to undertake a kodak sponsored investigation into the behaviour of thin-sheet crystals of silver halides , a field of research that would dominate the rest of his career .
in 1956 he was elected a fellow of the royal society for `` his work on the borderline between physics and chemistry about the adsorption of gases on surfaces , on catalysis and on the processes occurring in photographic emulsions . with the latter end in view he has investigated in some detail the properties of silver halide crystals ; he was the first to demonstrate networks of dislocations in a transparent crystal by making silver precipitate along them so that they become visible under the microscope . he has also shown by careful experimental work the role of the dislocations in providing sensitivity centres and their relation to such sensitisers as silver bromide . he has shown why the grains of the emulsions grow in a plate-like form with the octahedral faces exposed , and demonstrated the presence in such crystals of three dislocations meeting in a point , which determines the crystal form . `` in 1959 he took up the offer of a professorship at the university of virginia in charlottesville , where he continued his studies of crystal dislocations until his retirement as professor in 1979 and as emeritus professor and senior research fellow in 1995 . his tenure as professor was broken in 1963 when he briefly returned to the uk to take up a position as director of the national chemical laboratory , only for the ncl to be closed down the following year .
he died in 2007 . he had married three times but had no children .

christian gotthilf salzmann ( 1 june 1744 – 31 october 1811 ) was a german educational reformer and the founder of the schnepfenthal institution .


== life and career ==
salzmann was born on 1 june 1744 near erfurt , thuringia . his father was a protestant minister , and salzmann himself trained to become a pastor .
salzmann wrote bibliothek für jünglinge und mädchen , giving instructions on how to teach religion to children , but it was widely rejected by his superiors . because of this rejection , he accepted a position at basedow 's philanthropinum . from there , he continued to write papers about education reform , including his moralische elementarbuch in 1783 .
in 1785 , salzmann opened his own school , the schnepfenthal institution , which taught his new brand of practical education . while teaching at the school , he continued to publish works and even issued the periodical `` der bote aus thüringen `` .
he died on 31 october 1811 .


== connections to mary wollstonecraft ==
salzmann 's work reached the british public as elements of morality for the use of children ( 1790-91 ) , under the auspices of the liberal publisher joseph johnson . this was written by mary wollstonecraft , who began the work as a translation , but `` made the stories english , and added and altered where necessary `` , according to janet todd . this translation found a wider readership with a two-part essay in johnson 's analytical review . salzmann 's work was further adapted in 1872 , when charlotte m. yonge edited a storehouse of stories.according to henry crabb robinson , salzmann and wollstonecraft were in correspondence with each other . salzmann returned her interest by publishing her a vindication of the rights of woman , in german in 1793 . the main translation of her magnum opus was performed by one of the teachers at his school , georg friedrich christian weissenborn , but salzmann employed the author 's licence to make what robinson called `` edifying improvements `` . salzmann also published a german version of memoirs of the author of a vindication of the rights of woman , written by her widower , william godwin and again translated by salzmann 's employee weissenborn . in the prefaces to both these works , he expresses sympathy for her ideas and her life .

alfred herrhausen ( 30 january 1930 – 30 november 1989 ) was a german banker and the chairman of deutsche bank , who was assassinated in 1989 . he was a member of the steering committee of the bilderberg group and from 1971 onwards a member of deutsche bank 's management board . an advisor to helmut kohl and a proponent of a unified european economy , he was also an influential figure in shaping the policies towards developing nations . he was assassinated , probably by the west german far-left terrorist group red army faction , when an explosively formed projectile penetrated his armored convoy .


== assassination ==

herrhausen was killed by a sophisticated roadside bomb shortly after leaving his home in bad homburg on 30 november 1989 . he was being chauffeured to work in his armoured mercedes-benz , with bodyguards in both a lead vehicle and another following behind . the 7 kg bomb was hidden in a bag on a bicycle parked next to the road that the assassins knew herrhausen would be traveling in his three-car convoy . the bicycle had been consistently parked sans explosive in the same location along herrhausen 's route for extended period of time before the assassination itself , and as a result it was ignored by herrhausen 's security . the bomb was detonated when herrhausen 's car interrupted a beam of infrared light as it passed the bicycle . the bomb targeted the most vulnerable area of herrhausen 's car – the door where he was sitting – and required split-second timing to overcome the car 's special armour plating . the bomb utilized a misznay–schardin mechanism . a copper plate , placed between the explosive and the target , was deformed and projected by the force of the explosion . the detonation resulted in a mass of copper being projected toward the car at a speed of nearly two kilometers per second , efficiently penetrating the armoured mercedes . herrhausen 's legs were severed and he bled to death .


== aftermath ==
no one has ever been charged with the murder . for a long time , the german federal prosecutor 's office listed andrea klump and christoph seidler of the red army faction as the only suspects . the federal criminal police office ( germany ) presented a chief witness , siegfried nonne , who later retracted his statements in which he claimed to have sheltered four terrorists in his home . his half-brother hugo föller furthermore declared that no other persons had been at the flat at the time . on 1 july 1992 german television broadcast nonne 's explanations of how he was coached and threatened by the verfassungsschutz , the german internal intelligence agency , to become the main witness . in the same year , the alfred herrhausen society was established to honour his memory . in 2004 the federal prosecutor dropped the charges against the red army faction ; the investigation was to continue without naming a suspect . certain german and us media connected the assassination of alfred herrhausen to the staatssicherheitsdienst ( stasi ) of the gdr.the 2001 german documentary film black box brd retells the lives and deaths of alfred herrhausen and wolfgang grams , a raf member who was a major suspect in the attack on herrhausen.in 2008 , journalist carolin emcke published stumme gewalt ( mute force ) , a memorial to herrhausen , her godfather , encouraging dialogues between groups in societies , dialogues without violence , revenge and disrespect . she received the theodor wolff prize for the text .

= thomas sergeant hall =
thomas sergeant hall ( 23 december 1858 – 21 december 1915 ) was an australian geologist and biologist , recipient of the murchison fund in 1901 .


== early life ==
hall was born in geelong , the son of thomas march hall , a business man in that town but originally from lincolnshire , england and elizabeth , née walshe , from dublin . hall was educated at the geelong grammar school where he came under the influence of james l. cuthbertson . he was a junior master at wesley college in 1879-80 , then hawthorn college and then went to the university of melbourne , where he took his b.a . degree in 1886 with honours in natural science . this included work in palaeontology under sir frederick mccoy . hall taught for a year at girton college , sandhurst ( now bendigo ) in 1887 , but returned to the university and did a three years ' course in biology under professor sir baldwin spencer .


== career ==
hall took a leading part in the forming of the university science club , and through it met dr g. b. pritchard with whom he was later to do valuable work in geology . hall was a successful director of the castlemaine school of mines from 1890 to 1893 , and in the latter year became lecturer in biology at melbourne university . hall held this position until his death but found time for many other activities .
in 1899 hall published a catalogue of the scientific and technical periodical literature in the libraries of victoria . a second and enlarged edition , in which he was assisted by mr e. r. pitt of the public library , melbourne , appeared in 1911 . he did much valuable work for the field naturalists club of victoria ( president 1901–1903 ) , the royal society of victoria , and the australian and new zealand association for the advancement of science . his victorian hill and dale ( 1909 ) , describing the geology of the country around melbourne , is a model book of popular science , written without a trace of scientific jargon ; there is barely a technical term in its 150 pages . he did not write a large number of papers , but his work on the graptolite rocks of victoria led to his being made the recipient of the murchison fund of the geological society of london in 1901 . one of his major discoveries was the key to the unravelling of the complex ordovician sequence .


== legacy ==
hall became ill early in 1915 , but courageously carried on his work until shortly before his death from chronic nephritis on 21 december 1915 . he married miss eva lucie annie hill on 21 december 1891 , who survived him along with three sons and a daughter . he was given the honorary degree of d.sc . by melbourne university in 1908 .
dr hall was a good example of the hard-working man of science , giving much time to matters of routine , and yet contriving to do original and important work in one or more directions . hall 's work with dr pritchard on the tertiary fossiliferous strata of victoria , and his own work on the graptolite rocks of victoria gives him a permanent place in the history of australian geology .

= thomas michael donahue =
thomas michael donahue ( 23 may 1921 , healdton , oklahoma – 16 october 2004 , ann arbor , michigan ) was an american physicist , astronomer , and space and planetary scientist .
donahue graduated in 1942 from rockhurst college in kansas city and received in 1947 his phd in physics from johns hopkins university , with an interruption of his graduate studies by ww ii and service in the army signal corps .

after three years as a post-doctoral research associate and assistant professor at hopkins , tom joined the university of pittsburgh physics department in 1951 . at pittsburgh he organized an atomic physics and atmospheric science program that led to experimental and theoretical studies of the upper atmosphere of the earth and other solar system planets with instruments flown on sounding rockets and spacecraft . he became professor of physics in 1959 and eventually director of the laboratory for atmospheric and space sciences and the space research coordination center at the university . in 1960 he spent a sabbatical year on a guggenheim fellowship at the service d'aeronomie in paris , which began collaborations with french colleagues that flourished for more than 40 years . in 1974 he became the chairman of the atmospheric and oceanic science department , university of michigan , a position he held until 1981 .
according to the fall 2004 newsletter of the university of michigan 's department of atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences , donahue said :

i want to know how the planets of the solar system were formed , how they came to evolve as they did and the significance of all that for the existence of life in the solar system and in rest of the universe .
he was chairman of the committee on public policy of the american geophysical union and authored more than 200 research publications . tom 's influence in space exploration spanned many decades and diverse projects . he was an experimenter or interdisciplinary scientist on the orbiting geophysical observatory missions , apollo-17 , apollo-soyuz , voyager , pioneer venus multiprobe and orbiter , galileo , comet rendezvous asteroid flyby , and cassini . based on observations by the pioneer venus entry probe , he concluded that venus once had an ocean before a runaway greenhouse effect led to its current state . analyzing similar data from martian meteorites , he again argued for a substantial martian ocean , anticipating the current series of missions to mars . in these and many other cases he laid the foundation for our current understanding of planetary atmospheres .
in 1999 , tom described his career this way , `` i parlayed my training in atomic physics into a faculty position at pitt , doing research in aeronomy and laboratory studies of atomic physics . this led to rocket and satellite exploration of the upper atmosphere of earth in the 60s and spacecraft exploration of mars , venus and the outer planets beginning in the 70s . along the way my students , post-docs and i were deeply involved in the problem of anthropogenic destruction of the stratospheric ozone in the early 70s . this led to my continuing interest in global change . ``

upon his death , he was survived by his wife , three sons , and six grandchildren .

= hugo von seeliger =
hugo von seeliger ( 23 september 1849 – 2 december 1924 ) , also known as hugo hans ritter von seeliger , was a german astronomer , often considered the most important astronomer of his day .
he was born in biala , completed high school in teschen in 1867 , and studied at the universities of heidelberg and leipzig . he earned a doctorate in astronomy in 1872 from the latter , studying under carl christian bruhns . he was on the staff of the university of bonn observatory until 1877 , as an assistant to friedrich wilhelm argelander . in 1874 , he directed the german expedition to the auckland islands to observe the transit of venus . in 1881 , he became the director of the gotha observatory , and in 1882 became a professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the university of munich , which post he held until his death . his students included hans kienle , ernst anding , julius bauschinger , paul ten bruggencate , gustav herglotz , richard schorr , and especially karl schwarzschild , who earned a doctorate under him in 1898 , and acknowledged seeliger 's influence in speeches throughout his career .
seeliger was elected an associate of the royal astronomical society in 1892 , and president of the astronomische gesellschaft from 1897 to 1921 . he received numerous honours and medals , including knighthood ( ritter ) , between 1896 and 1917 .
his contributions to astronomy include an explanation of the anomalous motion of the perihelion of mercury ( later one of the main tests of general relativity ) , a theory of nova coming from the collision of a star with a cloud of gas , and his confirmation of james clerk maxwell 's theories of the composition of the rings of saturn by studying variations in their albedo . he is also the discoverer of an apparent paradox in newton 's gravitational law , known as seeliger 's paradox . however his main interest was in the stellar statistics of the bonner durchmusterung and bonn section of the astronomische gesellschaft star catalogues , and in the conclusions these led about the structure of the universe . seeliger 's views on the dimensions of our galaxy were consistent with jacobus kapteyn 's later studies .
he continued his work until his death , on 2 december 1924 , aged 75 .
the asteroid 892 seeligeria and the lunar crater seeliger were named in his honour . the brightening of saturn 's rings at opposition is known as the seeliger effect , to acknowledge his pioneering research in this field . minor planet 251 sophia is named after his wife , sophia .

= ernst kummer =
ernst eduard kummer ( 29 january 1810 – 14 may 1893 ) was a german mathematician . skilled in applied mathematics , kummer trained german army officers in ballistics ; afterwards , he taught for 10 years in a gymnasium , the german equivalent of high school , where he inspired the mathematical career of leopold kronecker .


== life ==
kummer was born in sorau , brandenburg ( then part of prussia ) . he was awarded a phd from the university of halle in 1831 for writing a prize-winning mathematical essay ( de cosinuum et sinuum potestatibus secundum cosinus et sinus arcuum multiplicium evolvendis ) , which was eventually published a year later .
kummer was married in 1840 to ottilie mendelssohn , daughter of nathan mendelssohn and henriette itzig . ottilie was a cousin of felix mendelssohn and his sister rebecca mendelssohn bartholdy , the wife of the mathematician peter gustav lejeune dirichlet . his second wife ( whom he married soon after the death of ottilie in 1848 ) , bertha cauer , was a maternal cousin of ottilie . overall , he had 13 children . his daughter marie married the mathematician hermann schwarz . kummer retired from teaching and from mathematics in 1890 and died three years later in berlin .


== mathematics ==
kummer made several contributions to mathematics in different areas ; he codified some of the relations between different hypergeometric series , known as contiguity relations . the kummer surface results from taking the quotient of a two-dimensional abelian variety by the cyclic group { 1 , −1 } ( an early orbifold : it has 16 singular points , and its geometry was intensively studied in the nineteenth century ) .
kummer also proved fermat 's last theorem for a considerable class of prime exponents ( see regular prime , ideal class group ) . his methods were closer , perhaps , to p-adic ones than to ideal theory as understood later , though the term 'ideal ' was invented by kummer . he studied what were later called kummer extensions of fields : that is , extensions generated by adjoining an nth root to a field already containing a primitive nth root of unity . this is a significant extension of the theory of quadratic extensions , and the genus theory of quadratic forms ( linked to the 2-torsion of the class group ) . as such , it is still foundational for class field theory .
kummer further conducted research in ballistics and , jointly with william rowan hamilton he investigated
ray systems .

johann jahn ( june 18 , 1750 in tasswitz , moravia – august 16 , 1816 in vienna ) was a german orientalist .


== biography ==
he studied at the faculty of philosophy of university of olomouc , and in 1772 began his theological studies at the premonstratensian convent of bruck , near znaim . having been ordained in 1775 , he for a short time held a cure at misslitz , but was soon recalled to bruck as professor of oriental languages and biblical hermeneutics .
on the suppression of the convent by joseph ii in 1784 , jahn took up similar work in olomouc , and in 1789 he was transferred to vienna as professor of oriental languages , biblical archaeology and dogmatics . in 1792 he published his einleitung ins alte testament ( 2 vols . ) , which soon brought him into trouble ; the cardinal-archbishop of vienna laid a complaint against him for having departed from the traditional teaching of the church , e.g . by asserting job , jonah , tobit and judith to be didactic poems , and the cases of demoniacal possession in the new testament to be cases of dangerous disease . an ecclesiastical commission reported that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical , but that jahn had erred in showing too little consideration for the views of german catholic theologians in coming into conflict with his bishop , and in raising difficult problems by which the unlearned might be led astray . he was accordingly advised to modify his expressions in future .
although he appears honestly to have accepted this judgment , the hostility of his opponents did not cease until at last ( 1806 ) he was compelled to accept a canonry at st stephens , vienna , which involved the resignation of his chair . this step had been preceded by the condemnation of his introductio in libros sacros veteris foederis in compendium redacta , published in 1804 , and also of his archaeologia biblica in compendium redacta ( 1805 ) . the only work of importance , outside the region of mere philology , afterwards published by him , was the enchiridion hermeneuticae ( 1812 ) .

== biography ==
hofreiter went to school in linz and studied from 1923 in vienna with hans hahn , wilhelm wirtinger , emil müller at the technische universität wien on descriptive geometry , and philipp furtwängler , with whom he obtained his doctorate in 1927 on the reduction theory of quadratic forms ( eine neue reduktionstheorie für definite quadratische formen ) . in 1928 he passed the lehramtsprüfung examination and completed the probationary year as a teacher in vienna , but then returned to the university ( first as a scientific assistant at the tu vienna ) where in 1929 he was assistant to furtwängler and then habilitated in 1933 . he was even then an excellent teacher , and gave lectures not only in vienna but also in graz .
his dissertation and habilitation thesis dealt with the reduction theory of quadratic forms , which gauss , charles hermite and hermann minkowski had worked on previously . hofreiter treated the case of four variables of a problem of minkowski ( minkowski had solved the problem for two variables , while robert remak had solved it for three variables ) on the product of inhomogeneous linear forms and achieved significant progress . the complete solution was only found 15 years later ( and the general case is still unresolved ) . in 1934 , he proved the existence of infinitely many real quadratic number fields without a euclidean algorithm . in addition , he dealt with the geometry of numbers and diophantine approximation .
in 1939 , he was an associate professor and married the mathematician margarete dostalík ( 1912-2013 ) . she was also a student of furtwängler and did important work on algebraic equations and was working as a meteorologist in berlin at the time . during the second world war , he moved from vienna and was a little later at the hermann goering aviation research institute in braunschweig , where his colleagues wolfgang gröbner from vienna , bernhard baule from graz , ernst peschl and josef laub were already working . through his work there , together with gröbner , he started a table of integrals . the first volume , on indefinite integrals , was published by notdruck ( braunschweig ) in 1944 and by springer in 1949 . in 1950 , the second volume containing definite integrals appeared . both parts were widely available through to the 5th 1973/75 edition . his wife , margaret , assisted with the calculations , as well as the preparation and review of both volumes .
in addition to their work at the aviation research institute , gröbner and hofreiter continued to give lectures and seminars at the technical university of braunschweig . after the war he returned to vienna in 1946 and continued to expand on his number theory work . he also worked on linear optimization and numerical mathematics . in 1954 , he became a professor , and in 1963/4 became dean of the faculty , and in 1965/6 , he was rector of the university of vienna . in 1974 , he retired .
in 1970 , hofreiter became a corresponding member of the austrian academy of sciences . he received the austrian cross of honour for science and art , 1st class in 1965 , the gold medal of honour of the city of vienna , the grand decoration of honour in silver for services to the republic of austria in 1977 , the commander 's cross of the order of st. gregory the great , the ring of honour of the austrian mathematical society . he was an honorary senator of the university of linz .

he was born in paris and was educated at the collège sainte-barbe and the lycée louis-le-grand . having demonstrated from childhood a talent for technology , his father decided to let him study at the ecole polytechnique in paris . he later moved to britain to continue his studies in manchester .
on his return to france his intention was to build steam engines but he was prevented from doing so by lack of funds . instead he opened a paris workshop in 1844 where , among other things , he worked on a telegraph with written and keyboard signals , improved gaetan bonelli 's electric loom and helped william hughes improve his early typewriter .
he also worked on the gyroscope with léon foucault , for whom he also made the pendulum for his famous demonstration in 1851 . in 1854 he built a simpler and improved version of charles shepherd 's electromechanical clock.he is best known for designing early electric motors for industrial use , for which he was awarded the valuable volta prize in 1857 . in his design electromagnets were energized to attract iron rods attached to a rotating flywheel . at the moment that an iron rod reached the electromagnet , the power to the solenoid was interrupted until the next iron rod approached the electromagnet .
on his death in 1865 he was buried in the père-lachaise cemetery in paris .

= len howard =
gwendolen howard ( 1894 - 5 january 1973 ) was a british naturalist and musician . she is known for the unique amateur bird studies that were published in various periodicals and two books under her pseudonym , len howard .
gwendolen howard was the last of four children born to henry newman howard ( 1861–1929 ) , the british poet and dramatist , and florence howard , née warman . born in the town of wallington , howard lived with her family in various homes throughout england and wales before beginning a music career in london , where she gave music lessons , organized concerts for children of the poor , and played viola in an orchestra under malcolm sargent . in 1938 , howard purchased a plot of land outside the village of ditchling and arranged for construction of the home she later called `` bird cottage . `` once resident in bird cottage , howard developed an intimate , cohabitational relationship with the wild birds in the area , providing food ( including her own war rations ) , chasing away predators , tending to damaged nests , and allowing the birds to fly and roost throughout her home . around 1949 , howard began publishing her field notes and `` bird biographies `` in british natural history periodicals , and in 1950 her first book was published by collins press . howard continued to write and publish about her birds until at least 1957 . believing that fear is the primary motivating factor in much of avian behaviour as observed by humans , and wanting to combat the scientific conclusions that had been drawn from such observations , howard strove to effect great control over her and her birds ' environment so as to maximize her birds ' sense of security , and to encourage an uninhibited relationship with them . to this end , howard was reclusive and gave strict instructions to those who ventured to visit her or contact her at bird cottage . howard also undertook a public campaign in 1960 to prevent development on the land surrounding her property.in her writings , howard argued that individual intelligence , and not mere instinct , is a factor in much of bird behaviour . howard paid especial attention to great tits in her studies , although she also wrote about other tits , robins , sparrows , blackbirds , thrushes , and finches , among others , and singled out particularly striking individuals for her biographies . howard 's musical training gave her unique insight into birdsong , and the final section of her first book is devoted to an in-depth analysis of this topic .
gwendolen howard died on 5 january 1973 , at bird cottage , at the age of 79.in 2016 a novel based on len howard 's life and work , 'het vogelhuis ' , written by the dutch author eva meijer , was published in the netherlands , where it became a best-seller . it has subsequently been translated into several languages . the english translation by antoinette fawcett , 'bird cottage ' , was published world-wide by the pushkin press on 30 august 2018 . eva meijer was interviewed about the book by jenni murray on the bbc radio four programme 'woman 's hour ' at 10.32 , and by sean rafferty on the bbc radio three programme 'in tune ' at 17.23 , on friday 31 august 2018 .

= nikolay umov =
nikolay alekseevich umov ( russian : никола́й алексе́евич у́мов ; january 23 , 1846 – january 15 , 1915 ) was a russian physicist and mathematician known for discovering the concept of umov-poynting vector and umov effect .


== biography ==
umov was born in 1846 in simbirsk ( present-day ulyanovsk ) in the family of a military doctor . he graduated from the physics and mathematics department of moscow state university in 1867 and became a professor of physics in 1875 . he studied theoretical physics by reading works of gabriel lamé , clebsch and clausius , that made a significant impact on the originality of his later ideas in physics .
umov became the head of the physics department of moscow state university ( msu ) after aleksandr stoletov died in 1896 . together with pyotr lebedev , umov actively participated in founding the physical institute at the msu .
he organized several educational societies . he was the president of the moscow society of nature explorers for 17 years . he was among the first russian scientists who acknowledged the importance of the theory of relativity . in 1911 , along with a group of leading professors , he left moscow university in protest of reactionary actions of the government . umov died in 1915 in moscow .


== contribution to physics ==
umov was the first who introduced in physics such basic concepts as speed and direction of movement of energy , which are now associated with umov-poynting vector , and density of energy in a given point of space . during his work in odessa in 1873—1874 , umov published first papers containing the major ideas of energy movement . in his first works of this period , umov considered potential energy as kinetic energy of some environments `` imperceptible for us `` . from this hypothesis , he made a conclusion : it is always possible to specify a place where the energy is in . therefore , it is natural to raise the question about movement of energy . in his following works , umov did not bind himself to this hypothesis about the nature of potential energy , but was guided by the principle of energy conservation only . after formulating the concept of density and movement of energy , he wrote differential equations for energy movement in the elastic media and in the fluid . the authoritative encyklopädie der mathematischen wissenschaften states : `` n. umov in 1874 had already solved a problem of the movement of energy in liquid and elastic media in completely generalized view . however , the intense attention to this view has been attracted only after poynting had presented a stream of electromagnetic energy based on maxwell equations `` ten years later than umov 's publications .
he was the first scientist to indicate interrelation between mass and energy proposing the formula e=kmc2 with 0,5 = < k = < 1 as early as in 1873 . in 1875 , umov solved a general problem of distribution of electric currents in conducting surfaces of any kind . in 1888—1891 he investigated experimentally the diffusion in water solutions , the polarization of light in opaque media , and discovered the effect of chromatic depolarization of light . in 1900 , he conducted a thorough analysis of many gauss formulae regarding terrestrial magnetism , which allowed the definition of secular changes of the earth 's magnetic field .

he was a professor at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign from 1953 to his death . he also had visiting positions at the university of chicago ( 1960–61 ) , the institute for advanced study ( 1962–63 , 1968–69 , spring 1981 ) , the university of tokyo ( spring 1971 ) , and the university of padua ( 1994 ) . suzuki received his ph.d in 1952 from the university of tokyo , despite having moved to the united states the previous year . he was the first to attack the burnside conjecture , that every finite non-abelian simple group has even order .
a notable achievement was his discovery in 1960 of the suzuki groups , an infinite family of the only non-abelian simple groups whose order is not divisible by 3 . the smallest , of order 29120 , was the first simple group of order less than 1 million to be discovered since dickson 's list of 1900 .
he classified several classes of simple groups of small rank , including the cit-groups and c-groups and ca-groups .
there is also a sporadic simple group called the suzuki group , which he announced in 1968 . the tits ovoid is also referred to as the suzuki ovoid .

= willoughby verner =
colonel william willoughby cole verner ( 22 october 1852 – 25 january 1922 ) was a british soldier , writer and ornithologist and inventor of a type of compass . he was briefly a professor of topography at the royal military academy sandhurst . he is remembered for bringing cueva de la pileta , a cave filled with prehistoric paintings , to international attention .


== life ==
verner was born in 1852 and he showed an early interest in bones owning the fossils of extinct animals . by 1867 he had started his own diary recording his interest in egg collecting and shooting . in 1874 he joined the rifle brigade and was posted to gibraltar although he also holidayed on the scottish island of tiree with fellow naturalist howard irby where they continued their interest in studying , shooting ( and eating ) the local wildlife . he continued his diary until 1890 .

he took out patents to improve a cavalry sketch board which was designed to be used strapped to the wrist . in 1895 verner had a novel version of a compass named after him . the compass was manufactured by two different companies and version nine of the design was still being made in 1942 .

verner became the official historian of the rifle brigade and he edited the letters home of one of its majors to produce a british rifle man : the journals and correspondence of major george simmons , rifle brigade , during the peninsular war & campaign of waterloo .
he also wrote the military life of h. r. h. george : duke of cambridge based on prince george , duke of cambridge .
he wrote sketches in the soudan ( sic ) in 1885 and rapid field-sketching and reconnaissance and advanced guard and outpost duties for riflemen in 1889 . the first british rifle corps . he wrote an historical account of the rifle brigade and of the king 's royal rifle corps in 1890 and some notes on military topography in 1891 and map reading and the elements of field sketching in 1893 . in 1894 his friend ( leonard ) howard irby published the ornithology of the strait of gibraltar and after he retired to algeciras he wrote my life among the wild birds in spain . with illustrations in 1909.in 1911 , verner discovered cueva de la pileta in benaoján and with abbe breuil also discovered devil 's tower cave in gibraltar . breil had come to spain because of verner 's reporting of cueva de la pileta near ronda . verner had been told of the cave that had been discovered by a spanish farmer called josé bullón in 1905 who was looking for bat guano . bullón had found human remains and markings on the walls , but assumed that they were made by the moors . verner had himself lowered into the cave and later reported his findings in the london-based saturday review . verner wrote a number of weekly reports for the review which factually described the cave , although verner accounted for the drawings of extinct animals by assuming that they had been sketched a result of observing the fossil bones that were there . it was these reports that brought breuil to spain with hugo obermaier , paul wernert and the spaniard juan cabre aquilo . breuil stayed in spain for two months studying the cave paintings whilst funded by the prince of monaco . verner later co-authored a scientific paper with breuil and obermaier on cueva de la pileta .
verner wrote history and campaigns of the rifle brigade in 1912 . in 1917 breuil returned and he and verner were warned off their next investigation of devil 's tower cave in gibraltar by a local policeman ( but not before they had retrieved some neanderthal tools ) . their final visit to the cave was in 1919 and they were convinced that this was another home to early man like the earlier finds at cuerva de la pieta and at forbes ' quarry cave , gibraltar 1 had been found over fifty years earlier . their confidence was confirmed when gibraltar 2 was found nearby in the early 1920s by dorothy garrod who had come to investigate at breuil 's encouragement .

= philibert orry =
philibert orry , count of vignory and lord of la chapelle-godefroy ( born in troyes on 22 january 1689 – died at la chapelle-godefroy on 9 november 1747 ) , was a french statesman .


== life ==
the fifth child of jean orry , a leading economist , philibert orry served as a cavalry captain during the war of spanish succession , before becoming a member of the parlement of paris , then master of requests in 1715 . he was an intendant in lille ( 1715-1718 ) , soissons ( 1722-1727 ) , and roussillon ( 1727-1728 ) .
orry was named controller-general of finances in 1730 and combined this function with being director general of the bâtiments du roi ( `` the king 's buildings `` ) in 1736 , after the death of the duc d'antin . orry remained controller-general until 1745 , making him the longest continuously-serving holder of the office in the eighteenth-century .
an able economist , orry had to restore the dixième ( `` tenth `` ) tax and declared the venality of municipal officials , successfully balancing the budget in 1739-40 . applying the principles of colbert , he sought to develop the domestic manufacture of textiles and paper , and was involved in the production of porcelain in vincennes in 1740 . he supported trade with canada and the indies by reforming the statutes of the compagnie des indes .
as director general of buildings , he established the bi-annual public paris salon , and became the vice-protecteur of the académie royale de peinture et de sculpture ( `` royal academy of painting and sculpture `` ) in april 1737 . his directorship has , generally , been harshly judged . the marquis d'argenson spoke with contempt of `` the bad , bourgeois taste of monsieur orry `` . however , orry 's selection of charles-joseph natoire in 1730 to decorate his château de la chapelle-godefroy ( see below ) reveals , on the contrary , a certain discernement in artistic matters : natoire was one of the most promising young history painters , and his two main rivals - françois boucher and carle van loo - were both abroad .
as director general of ponts et chaussées ( bridges and highways ) , orry finished the crozat canal and maintained and developed france 's road system . he sent to the intendants , in 1738 , a detailed instruction on the duty ( la corvée royale ) for all inhabitants to spend a fortnight a year on the construction and maintenance of transport routes , classed in five categories . the corvée made france 's major road network the finest in europe , and before the revolution , a great part of the public roads existed thanks to this institution . this policy of improved communications also led to the completion of the cassini map in 1744.facing opposition from madame de pompadour , orry resigned in 1745 .
he was the treasurer of the order of the holy spirit from february 1743 to his death in 1747 .


== residences ==
orry owned the château de la chapelle-godefroy in saint-aubin near nogent-sur-seine , inherited from his father in 1719 . `` m. orry `` , wrote the duc de luynes in his mémoires , `` has always appeared to have no ambition , always regretting not being able to live on his estate , near nogent , and always ready to go there with pleasure . `` he transformed and expanded considerably the seigneurial estate . he owned two paintings by jean-antoine watteau , the enchanteur and the 'aventurière , which today are in the musée des beaux-arts in troyes .
orry also possessed an estate , petit bercy , in paris .

= roger fenton ( priest ) =
roger fenton ( 1565–1615 ) was an english clergyman , one of the translators of the authorised king james version .


== life ==
he was born in lancashire and was educated at pembroke hall , cambridge , where he matriculated as a sizar in 1585 . he graduated b.a . in 1589 , becoming a fellow in 1590 . he graduated m.a . in 1592 ; he later proceeded b.d . in 1602 and d.d . in 1613 . from 1598 he was preacher to the readers at gray 's inn , and held the post till his death.in 1601 he was made rector of st. stephen 's , walbrook , and in 1603 of the neighbouring st. benet 's sherehog . he resigned the latter in 1606 , on his appointment to the vicarage of chigwell , essex . in 1609 he succeeded lancelot andrewes in the prebend of st. pancras in st. paul 's , which made him rector and patron , as well as vicar , of chigwell . fenton was one of the second westminster company of translators of the king james bible , dealing with the epistles of the new testament . he died 16 january 1615 , and was buried under the communion-table .


== works ==
fenton 's first work , an answer to william alablaster his motives , was published in 1599 , noting that william alabaster was then a prisoner in the tower of london .
in 1611 fenton published a treatise of usurie , in three books ; there was a second edition in 1612 . in 1652 there appeared a tract by robert filmer the author states in his preface that george downame , fenton and andrewes are the noted opponents of usury , in england , but ( he continues ) ' i have made choice of dr. fenton 's treatise to examine because it is latest , and i find little of any moment but is in him . ' a note by roger twysden in filmer 's book suggests it was written three decades before publication .
a manuscript in the cambridge university library ( ms ff . 5 . 25 , fos . 17r–22r ) contains a contemporary copy of a brief treatise by fenton , entitled 'de æquivocatione ' ( on equivocation ) . it is dedicated to sir francis bacon in his capacity as solicitor-general , and must therefore date from between 1607 and 1613 . like the english treatise of usurie this latin document consists of the resolution of three disputed questions on the subject of the work .
fenton was a popular preacher of the day ; one of his sermons , 'of simonie and sacriledge , ' was published in 1604 , from which it appears that he was at that date chaplain to sir thomas egerton , the lord chancellor . another was published in 1615 , 'upon oathes , ' preached before the grocers ' company ; and a small volume containing four more appeared in 1616 .
in 1617 , fenton 's successor at chigwell , emmanuel utie , published a posthumous work by fenton entitled a treatise against the necessary dependence upon that one head and the present reconciliation to the church of rome . together with certaine sermons preached in publike assemblies . utie prefixes a dedication of his own to sir francis bacon , in which he calls the treatise 'the posthumus [ image ] of doctor fenton ' , but says that it lacked final revision . in his dedication he alludes to fenton 's earlier dedication of his treatise on usury to bacon 's predecessor as lord keeper , sir thomas egerton . the sermons in this volume are six in number , with three of them having been preached before king james .

chang kia-ngau ( chinese : 张嘉璈 ; pinyin : zhāng jiā'áo ; wade–giles : chang chia-ao ; 1889–1979 ) , courtesy name gōngquán ( 公权 ) , was a chinese banker , politician , and scholar . he was an influential figure in the history of modern chinese central bank .


== biography ==
chang was born in 1889 in jiading outside of shanghai . his grandfather was a qing dynasty official and his father a doctor , so he and his siblings enjoyed educational opportunities not available to most of their countrymen . while his brother , carsun chang distinguished himself in the world of politics , chang kia-ngau became a leading figure in modern chinese banking .
chang kia-ngau was a supporter of reform in china and started his public service career in 1910 as editor-in-chief of the official gazette published by the ministry of communications . in 1913 he started his banking career assistant manager of the bank of china in shanghai . he distinguished himself just a few years later in 1916 when he refused a request by yuan shikai to stop redeeming banknotes for silver . the move was meant to secure silver deposits for yuan 's use , but would have undermined confidence in the new currency , so chang disregarded the order and was instrumental in the bank 's separation from the peking government 's control . by 1923 , the bank of china was almost exclusively owned by private , shanghai-based shareholders , and during the next decade , it became the largest bank , by far , in republican china .
under chang 's leadership , the bank of china resisted the kuomintang government 's pressure to return to government control and to purchase government bonds which would contribute to ever-growing deficits . in 1928 , t. v. soong tried quite aggressively to assert control over the bank , but chang and the directors resisted , so soong created the central bank of china . chang agreed to finance the new central bank 's creation in exchange for a measure of independence and a charter to serve as the country 's international exchange bank . chang 's interest was the development of the country , particularly railroad and other infrastructure development , even if such projects were not particularly profitable for the bank .
in march 1935 , h.h . kung staged a coup against the bank of china and bank of communications , forcing both to create new shares to allow the government to take a controlling share financed by overvalued government bonds . chang kia-ngau was removed as general manager of the bank of china and was offered a lesser role within the central bank . he declined the offer , but in december 1935 , accepted the position of minister of railways .
during much of the sino-japanese war , chang served as minister of communications , accompanying the central government from nanking to chungking . after mid-1943 , he was in the u.s. frequently promoting aid to the republic of china and at the negotiations of post-war arrangements , including aviation rights . he wrote a book on railroad development which was published in the u.s. at a time when interest in china was high . after the war , he was appointed economic commissioner for manchuria , and his diaries from this period were also published in the u.s .
after his departure from china , chang moved to the us and was a senior research fellow at the hoover institution at stanford university . he died on october 13 , 1979 in palo alto , california . his wife , chang pihya , died in palo alto on may 17 , 1997 .

antoni bolesław dobrowolski ( 6 june 1872 , in dworszowice kościelne – 27 april 1954 , in warsaw ) , was a polish geophysicist , meteorologist and explorer .


== early life ==
dobrowolski was born into an indigent family and supported himself from the age of 12 by teaching younger students while a high school student in warsaw . his involvement in seeking polish independence led to a conviction to three years imprisonment in the caucasus , but after two years he escaped and started studying in switzerland and belgium .


== belgian antarctic expedition ==
while still a student in biology , physics and chemistry at the university of liège he took part in the belgian antarctic expedition ( 1897-1899 ) as assistant meteorologist . henryk arctowski , who was in charge of physical observations , was initially unsuccessfully in convincing expedition commander adrien de gerlache to take him on , but when the belgica had to return to ostend for repairs and the ship 's doctor and a sailor quit , he was contracted as a sailor .
however , his substantial scientific contributions prompted de gerlache to formally promote him in march 1898 . arctowski and dobrowolski were the first to conduct year-round meteorological and hydrographical observations off antarctica . in addition he studied ice crystallography and light phenomena in ice clouds . these data enabled him to write a monumental treatise on the crystallography of ice and snow .
after his return from the antarctic he obtained a scholarship in belgium to study his results and collaborated with georges lecointe at the royal observatory of belgium .


== later career ==
in 1907 nicholas ii of russia declared amnesty for political refugees , enabling dobrowolski to return to warsaw . until 1914 , he worked as a schoolteacher . during the first world war he lived in sweden , where he studied ice and snow formation . after the war he returned to poland , where he finished his treatise on the crystallography of ice and snow , natural history of ice ( historia naturalna lodu ) . the concept of the cryosphere can be traced back to this monogram . he also published works on pedagogy and research ethics , while teaching pedagogy at the polish free university in warsaw , and was deeply involved in the organization of education in newly independent poland . in 1924 he was appointed deputy director , and later director , of the polish meteorological institute in warsaw.he founded several observatories and the society of geophysicists in warsaw , and actively promoted polar research in poland . during the second polar year ( 1932-1933 ) he provided practical help and advice to the polish expedition that overwintered on bear island . he headed the organizing committee of the 1934 polish expedition to spitsbergen , and was involved with the 1938 polish expedition to oscar ii land . after the second world war he pushed for further polish scientific involvement in polar research . he died in 1954 , without seeing the implementation of his ideas in the polish participation in the international geophysical year . his fellow polish explorers and scientists regarded him as a `` father figure `` , and he naturally became a center of polar knowledge .


== tributes ==
an inactive polish research station in the bunger hills , dobrowolski island , dobrowolski peak and dobrowolski glacier ( both on king george island ) are named after him .

= hans-egon richert =
hans-egon richert ( june 2 , 1924 – november 25 , 1993 ) was a german mathematician who worked primarily in analytic number theory . he is the author ( with heini halberstam ) of a definitive book on sieve theory .


== life and education ==
hans-egon richert was born in 1924 in hamburg , germany . he attended the university of hamburg and received his ph.d under max deuring in 1950 . he held a temporary chair at the university of göttingen and then a newly created chair at the university of marburg . in 1972 he moved to the university of ulm , where he remained until his retirement in 1991 . he died on november 25 , 1993 in blaustein , near ulm , germany .


== work ==
richert worked primarily in analytic number theory , and beginning around 1965 started a collaboration with heini halberstam and shifted his focus to sieve theory . for many years he was a chairman of the analytic number theory meetings at the mathematical research institute of oberwolfach .


=== analytic number theory ===
richert made contributions to additive number theory , dirichlet series , riesz summability , the multiplicative analog of the erdős–fuchs theorem , estimates of the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups , and bounds for exponential sums . he proved the exponent 15/46 for the dirichlet divisor problem , a record that stood for many years .


=== sieve methods ===
one of richert 's notable results was the jurkat–richert theorem , joint work with wolfgang b. jurkat that improved the selberg sieve and is used in the proof of chen 's theorem .
richert also produced a `` readable form `` of chen 's theorem ( it is covered in the last chapter of sieve methods ) .
halberstam & richert 's book sieve methods was the first exhaustive account of the subject .

in reviewing the book in 1976 , hugh montgomery wrote `` in the past , researchers have generally derived the sieve bounds required for an application , but now workers will find that usually an appeal to an appropriate theorem of sieve methods will suffice , `` and `` for years to come , sieve methods will be vital to those seeking to work in the subject , and also to those seeking to make applications . ``

= gopala bhatta goswami =
gopala bhatta goswami ( 1503–1578 ) is one of the foremost disciples of the vaishnava saint , chaitanya mahaprabhu , and a leading historical figure in the gaudiya vaishnava school of hinduism . he was part of a group of vaishnava devotees known collectively as the six goswamis of vrindavan , who were influential in establishing the philosophical basis of the gaudiya tradition in formalised writings .


== background ==
born in a sri vaishnava family of tamil iyengar origin in sri rangam , and the son of venkatta bhatta , gopala bhatta goswami was a great devotee of laxmi-narayana . according to biographies such as the bhakti ratnakara gopal bhatta 's first meeting with shri chaitanya mahaprabhu was in 1510 during mahaprabhu 's tour of south india . although of a young age he was given the opportunity to meet with chaitanya and serve him over a number of months . such was his love for the saint , that when chaitanya mahaprabhu was about to leave , gopala bhatta became upset , and for gopala bhatta 's sake , chaitanya then agreed to stay a few more days .
according to gaudiya tradition it was during this time that gopala bhatta had a spiritual vision in which chaitanya mahaprabhu revealed himself as an avatar of krishna , the supreme god . in the vision krishna then told him that in the town of vrindavan he would meet with two devotees , namely rupa goswami and sanatana goswami who would instruct him in the finer details of devotional service ( bhakti ) .
when gopala bhatta awoke from the experience , he wanted to leave for vrindavan at once , however chaitanya mahaprabhu told him to stay and serve his parents . after chaitanya 's departure , gopal bhatta took guidance from his uncle prabhodananda sarasvati . gopal bhatta took care of his parents into their old age , and then after they died he then traveled to vrindavana . there he met rupa and sanatana who accepted him as a brother . gopal bhatta later helped sanatana compile the book hari bhakti vilasa .


== vrindavan ==

gopala bhatta studied rhetoric , poetry , vedanta , and sanskrit grammar from his uncle prabodhananda sarasvati . after the passing of his parents he went to vrindavan , where he met both rupa and sanatana goswamis as had purportedly been instructed in his vision .
when lord chaitanya discovered that gopala bhatta was in vrindavan , he was extremely pleased and sent some of his personal belongings to gopala bhatta , who worshiped them . mahaprabhu also sent a letter instructing gopala bhatta to help rupa and sanatana compile vaishnava literature . gopala bhatta accepted this instruction as his life and soul , and he later also engaged his disciple srinivasa acarya in carrying the writings to bengal . gopala bhatta established the radha raman temple in vrindavan in 1542 , his samadhi also exists within the temple complex .

taurinus described his logarithmic-spherical geometry as the `` third system `` besides euclidean geometry and spherical geometry , and pointed out that infinitely many systems exist depending on an arbitrary constant . while he noticed that no contradictions can be found in his logarithmic-spherical geometry , he remained convinced of the special role of euclidean geometry . according to paul stäckel and friedrich engel , as well as zacharias , taurinus must be given credit as a founder of non-euclidean trigonometry ( together with gauss ) , but his contributions can not be considered as being on the same level as those of the main founders of non-euclidean geometry , nikolai lobachevsky and jános bolyai .
taurinus corresponded with gauss about his ideas in 1824 . in his reply , gauss mentioned some of his own ideas on the subject , and encouraged taurinus to further investigate this topic , but he also told taurinus not to publicly cite gauss . when taurinus sent his works to gauss , the latter did n't respond – according to stäckel that was probably due to the fact that taurinus mentioned gauss in the prefaces of his books . in addition , taurinus sent some copies of his `` geometriae prima elementa `` to friends and authorities ( stäckel reported a positive reply by georg ohm ) . dissatisfied with the lack of recognition , taurinus burnt the remaining copies of that book – the only copy found by stäckel and engel was in the library of the university of bonn . in 2015 , another copy of the `` geometriae prima elementa `` was digitized and made freely available online by the university of regensburg .

jacob arlow ( 1912–2004 ) was an american teacher , scholar , and clinician who served as president of the american psychoanalytic association and the new york psychoanalytic institute .

== fantasy and myth ==
in perhaps his most significant theoretical contribution to psychoanalysis , arlow explored the role of unconscious fantasy from the point of view of ego psychology , both subsuming its use in kleinian theory , and providing the building block for brenner 's later development of conflict theory.his earlier article on 'fantasy systems in twins ' ( 1960 ) was used by maynard solomon to illuminate the inner development of beethoven , arlow observing that the “ bond of complete understanding which is missing with the parent unites the twins in the wish fantasy ... .the existence of another individual who is a reflection of the self brings the experience of twinship in line with the psychology of the double ” .he also explored the role of myth in bridging the gap between individual instinctual conflicts and cultural ideals .


== psychoanalyitc limitations ==
arlow insisted on the limitations of psychoanalysis , inherent both in its technique and in the human experience itself , and warned against any quest for perfection through psychoanalysis .


== criticism ==
heinz kohut in his self psychology would challenge the arlow/brenner belief that narcissistic personality disorder could be understood within the methodology of the transference neurosis .

brukhonenko is primarily remembered for his development of the autojektor , one of the first heart and lung machines . the device was used with mixed results in a series of experiments with canines during the year 1939 , which can be seen in the film experiments in the revival of organisms . while some today speculate that the film is a re-staging of the procedures , the experiments themselves were well documented , and resulted in brukhonenko being posthumously awarded the prestigious lenin prize .
brukhonenko was also known for his experiments of decapitating animals ( mainly dogs ) and attempting to put them on life support thus keeping the head alive for multiple hours .

= lucien g c3 a9las =
lucien gélas ( 1 january 1873 or 12 january 1873 – 5 june 1944 ) was a luthier , classical guitarist , and teacher .
gélas was born in menton , alpes maritimes . he composed for solo guitar and as well as works for voice and guitar set to his own texts . gélas owned the complete historic works of sor as published by meissonnier ( paris 1820-36 ) and pacini ( 1830–36 ) . the works are now a part of the spencer collection at the royal academy of music in london .


== gélas guitar ( double-top guitar ) ==
gélas is well known for inventing and patenting a guitar design which uses a double top : it is often called a gélas guitar , or a double-top guitar ( or double-resonance-guitar ) and was common in the first half of the 20th century .
gélas was awarded a gold medal at the bordeaux exhibition in 1907 and a gold medal at the brussels exhibition in 1910 for his double-top instruments.the two tops of the instruments have a resonating space between them . the inner top is not parallel to the outer one , such that the guitar can be observed to have a particular tilt . also , the strings run through the bridge ( which is on the inner top ) and are attached at the bottom , in such a way that the plucked part of the string before the bridge is at an angle to the part of the string after the bridge . this is achieved by having the plucked part of the string slightly angled to the inner top ( in conventional guitar it would be parallel ) , resulting in a raised tension in the inner top .
the patent was first filed in paris in 1905 ; and the patent text is downloadable in french and english.his guitars were played by numerous important artists , particularly in the first half of the 20th century . heinrich albert ( 1870–1950 ) obtained a gélas guitar ( from gaudet in paris ) and ascribes his concert successes in a large part to the guitar , praising its carrying sound , ease of responsiveness , and tone-colour . other players of gélas guitars included luise walker ( 1910–1998 ) and bruno henze ( 1900–1978 ) .
gélas produced the instruments with the help of guitar-makers ( following his patent ) , at first théodore gaudet and later jean roviès , beuscher , richard jacob and others . the instruments included classical guitars , mandolins , jazz double-basses and hawaiian guitars .

smirnov has been characterized in the media as a rasputin-like character with `` almost mystical powers of persuasion `` . according to his wife rusalkina , the soviet military enlisted smirnov 's psychotechnology in the 1980s to combat the mujahideen and treat post-traumatic stress syndrome in russian soldiers during the war in afghanistan . smirnov 's background included military research , and the care of drug addiction and mental illness . he founded the psychotechnology research institute at the peoples ' friendship university of russia to work on ideas like `` psychocorrection `` , a term he used to denote the use of subliminal messages to alter a subject 's will , or even modify a person 's personality without their knowledge.the institute caught the attention of chris morris and janet morris who were reportedly attempting to sell technology to the united states military . the fbi consulted smirnov regarding the waco siege in 1993 . smirnov proposed piping subliminal messages from sect members ' families through the phone lines during negotiations so as to effect the surrender of david koresh , however the fbi declined the plan . smirnov died in november 5 , 2004 , leaving his wife to run the institute.in may 2009 , the u.s. department of homeland security announced plans to award a contract for testing of an airport screening system based partly on smirnov 's concepts to mantech srs technologies in association with northam psychotechnologies , a canadian company acting as distributor for the psychotechnology research institute .

rev . nehemiah strong ( 24 february 1729 ( n.s . ) – 13 august 1807 ) was an american astronomer and meteorologist who was the first professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at yale college from 1770 and produced a series of annual ephemerides , the astronomical element in almanacs , which were printed in hartford , connecticut , and in new haven.strong was born in northampton , massachusetts , eldest of three children of nehemiah and hannah strong and the grandson of samuel and esther ( clapp ) strong , of northampton , massachusetts.nehemiah strong graduated from yale college in 1755 . he entered on a tutorship at yale in november 1757 and was soon licensed to preach and was settled congregationalist minister at turkey hill , now part of east granby , connecticut , 1761-67 .
his marriage to lydia smith proved to be an embarrassment , when after she had been granted a divorce in february 1759 on grounds of abandonment , her husband , andrew burr jr of new haven , having gone to the west indies in january 1755 , burr reappeared and her marriage to nehemiah strong was necessarily annulled , and as a result of entanglements he was dismissed from his pastorate at turkey hill , 23 june 1767 . he married mrs mary thomas , the widow of dr lemuel thomas of newtown , 15 june 1778 .
thereafter he resided in newtown , in new milford , where he kept an academy for boys , and , from 1803 in bridgeport , giving occasional sermons and teaching to the time of his death . he resigned his chair at yale in 1781 , in a dispute over his salary , exacerbated by the sense on the part of the corporation that he was not a sufficiently ardent patriot . he represented newtown in the connecticut general assembly , may 1784 . his portrait by ralph earl , painted in 1789-90 , was presented to yale by the artist and remains in the university 's collection .
his treatise on astronomy won him such a wide reputation that anonymous almanacs were attributed to him . his first essay at compiling an almanac was anonymous , for watson 's register for 1775 , printed at hartford ; his second essay was the connecticut almanack for 1778 , which identified his yale title only . from 1782 he published almanacs under his own name at hartford and as `` hosea stafford `` in new haven ( 1776–1804 ) . in addition , finding that he was publicly assumed to be the `` isaac bickerstaff `` , having disclaimed authorship in a letter to the connecticut journal , new haven , 27 october 1784 , he apparently decided to take up the slack and issue almanacs as `` bickerstaff `` himself : they appeared at hartford for several years after 1785.in a letter of 6 may 1803 to elisha babcock , strong remarks that the calculations for the forthcoming year will be his last :

i am pretty well tired of the business . for 29 years past i have successively furnished one or more copies for printer ; generally two , sometimes three in a year . and i think i have done my part . tis an elaborate fatiguing business , and requires the closest care and attention to do the business with proper accuracy , and takes a large portion of my time .

he recommended his pupil david sanford of newtown , connecticut .

= johann zahn =
johann zahn ( 29 march 1641 , karlstadt am main – 27 june 1707 ) was the seventeenth-century german author of oculus artificialis teledioptricus sive telescopium ( würzburg , 1685 ) . this work contains many descriptions and diagrams , illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and magic lantern , along with various other lanterns , slides , projection types , peepshow boxes , microscopes , telescopes , reflectors , and lenses . as a student of light , zahn is considered the most prolific writer and illustrator of the camera obscura .
zahn was a canon of the premonstratensian monastery of oberzell near würzburg ( see kloster oberzell ) .
the first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography ( that is , actually capturing the image on some sort of medium ) was envisioned by zahn in 1685 , though it would be almost 150 years before technology caught up to the point where this was possible to actually build ( see history of the camera ) .
in oculus artificialis , zahn 's comprehensive description of the magic lantern ( along with twelve other different lanterns ) includes some of these lanterns showing for the first time lens covers . this was a very important evolution in the history of the camera , because it meant that the screen could be kept dark while the operator changed the slide .
zahn used the magic lantern , whose invention he credited to athanasius kircher , for anatomical lectures .
he also illustrated a large workshop camera obscura for solar observations using the telescope and scioptric ball . zahn also includes an illustration of a camera obscura in the shape of a goblet , based on a design described ( but not illustrated ) by pierre hérigone . zahn also designed several portable camera obscuras , and made one that was 23 inches long . he demonstrated the use of mirrors and lenses to erect the image , enlarge and focus it .
zahn is also the author of a compendium of mathematics and natural history , titled specula physico-mathematico-historica notabilium ac mirabilium sciendorum ( 1696 ) .

for the relation between electromagnetic mass and electromagnetic energy .
wien developed the wien filter ( also known as velocity selector ) in 1898 for the study of anode rays . it is a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that can be used as a velocity filter for charged particles , for example in electron microscopes and spectrometers . it is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed . the device is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields , such that particles with the correct speed will be unaffected while other particles will be deflected . it can be configured as a charged particle energy analyzer , monochromator , or mass spectrometer .
while studying streams of ionized gas , wien , in 1898 , identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom . wien , with this work , laid the foundation of mass spectrometry . j. j. thomson refined wien 's apparatus and conducted further experiments in 1913 then , after work by ernest rutherford in 1919 , wien 's particle was accepted and named the proton .
in 1911 , wien was awarded the nobel prize in physics `` for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat `` .

he studied natural science at the university of göttingen in göttingen , germany , but transferred to the university of berlin in 1835 to study plants . johann horkel , schleiden 's uncle , encouraged him to study plant embryology.he soon developed his love for botany into a full-time pursuit . schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope . as a professor of botany at the university of jena , he wrote contributions to our knowledge of phytogenesis ( 1838 ) , in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells . thus , schleiden and schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry . he also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus , discovered in 1831 by the scottish botanist robert brown , and sensed its connection with cell division .
he became professor of botany at the university of dorpat in 1863 . he concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from the one cell .

= thomas phelippes =
thomas phelippes ( 1556–1625 ) , also known as thomas phillips was a linguist , who was employed as a forger and intelligence gatherer . he served mainly under sir francis walsingham , in the time of elizabeth i , and most notably deciphered the coded letters of babington plot conspirators .


== life and education ==
little is known about phelippes family background except that he was the son of a cloth merchant . despite his humble origins , it is believed that he entered trinity college , cambridge , in 1569 and graduated with a bachelor of arts in 1574 . phelippes was a linguist who could speak french , italian , spanish , latin and german . his education helped him to master cipher skills and be an excellent cryptographer of high reputation . therefore , he was employed by sir francis walsingham , the principal secretary to queen elizabeth i .
the physical and intellectual stature of phelippes was described as `` a small , lean , yellow-haired , short-sighted man , with pock-marked face , an excellent linguist , and , above all , a person with a positive genius for deciphering letters . ``


== babington plot ==

he is most remembered for his postscript to the `` bloody letter `` sent by mary , queen of scots , to anthony babington regarding the babington plot . when he sent walsingham the letter proving mary , queen of scots 's complicity in the plot phelippes had drawn a gallows on the envelope . according to historian neville williams , the notes were smuggled to mary via empty barrels from a brewer in burton upon trent who supplied the house at chartley manor where she was being held prisoner in the custody of sir amias paulet . phelippes was kept busy with a backlog of correspondence requested by her majesty whose letters contained day to day matters as well as those of a more sensitive type . walsingham had to wait a whole seven months before he got what he wanted . this postscript asked babington for the names of the plotters involved in the planned assassination of queen elizabeth i , and hence francis walsingham was able to prove mary 's direct involvement in the plot , and have her executed .


== in popular culture ==
in episode four of the 1971 bbc-tv mini-series elizabeth r , `` horrible conspiracies `` written by hugh whitemore , phelippes is played by david nettheim .
the 2006 tv miniseries the virgin queen featured vincent franklin as phelippes .
in the 2008 bbc radio 4 afternoon play the babington plot written by michael butt , thomas phelippes is voiced by jonathan tafler .
“ the chronicles of christoval alvarez ” series of mystery-adventure novels authored by ann swinfen include phelippes as a regular character .
the alternate history thriller novel ruled britannia by harry turtledove features phelippes as an important supporting character .

anna bayerová ( 4 november 1853 – 24 january 1924 ) was the second czech female medical doctor , after bohuslava kecková . both of them were prevented from practicing as doctors in their own country so kecková became a czech midwife , whereas bayerová had a medical practise in berne .


== biography ==
bayerová was born in vojtěchov ( now part of mšeno ) near mělník on 4 november 1853 , the youngest child of josef and marie bayer . she attended school in mělník until 1868 , when she moved to prague , where she met the authors eliška krásnohorská and sofie podlipská , and took gymnasial exams , despite not being allowed to attend the gymnasium .
in 1875 , bayerová moved to zurich and started attending classes at the university of zurich . however , she suffered financial problems and returned home in 1878 . eventually , after receiving money to continue her studies , anna bayerová graduated from the university of bern and thus became the second female czech physician in 1881 . however , like the first female czech physician ( bohuslava kecková , who graduated in 1880 from the university of zurich ) , bayerová graduated from a swiss university rather than a czech one , and had to practice abroad as her doctorate was not recognized by her homeland . the third woman doctor was anna honzáková . bayerová graduated from the university of bern and was the first to practice successfully . she established her own private practice in berne whereas bohuslava kecková had the first qualification she became a czech midwife.in 1889 bayerová 's achievement was recognised by popular support . 700 women wrote an open letter to her and the women 's magazine ženské listy . the letter hoped that she could return as they wanted to see female doctors in their country.she died on 24 january 1924 in prague . in her hometown there is a street named in her honour .

= benno kerry =
benno kerry ( né kohn ; 11 december 1858 – 20 may 1889 ) was an austrian philosopher .


== life ==
kerry was born as benno kohn in vienna . he studied under ernst laas and otto liebmann at the university of strassburg and from 1877/78 under franz brentano at the university of vienna . in 1881 he obtained his doctorate with the dissertation untersuchungen über das causalproblem auf dem boden einer kritik der einschlägigen lehren j. st. mills ( `` investigations concerning the problem of causality on the basis of a critique of the relevant doctrines of john stuart mill `` ) . in vienna , as part of the school of brentano he befriended alois höfler.in 1885 he obtained his habilitation as privatdozent in strasburg with grundzüge einer theorie der mathematischen und nicht-mathematischen grenzbegriffe . ein beitrag zur erkenntnistheorie ( `` foundations of a theory of mathematical and non-mathematical limit concepts . a contribution to epistemology `` ) and became the assistant of the neo-kantian wilhelm windelband .
kerry was influenced by bernard bolzano and became an important conduit of his work . he was among the first students of brentano ( with meinong and höfler ) to distinguish clearly between concept and object .
kerry died on 20 may 1889 as a result of an ear infection .


== influence ==
kerry exercised an influence not just within the circle of brentano , especially on alois höfler ( for the concept `` psychical labor `` ) , edmund husserl ( in the philosophy of arithmetic ) , and kazimierz twardowski , but also on gottlob frege . in fact , frege conceived his paper `` concept and object `` as a reply to kerry 's criticisms . furthermore he was in close contact with georg cantor and it is thanks to his review of the mannigfaltigkeitslehre that bertrand russell came to know of the work of cantor .


=== kerry and frege ===
kerry ( in particular in his fourth article ) criticized frege for having confused concept and object in his die grundlagen der arithmetik and in begriffsschrift . frege responded to a number of aspects of this critique in 1892 with the paper `` begriff und gegenstand `` ( `` concept and object `` ) . the controversy became known as the `` concept horse problem `` or `` kerry 's paradox . ``

, are not valid for quantum theory.the reason for this is that a quantum disjunction , unlike the case for classical disjunction , can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is , in turn , attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case , in quantum mechanics , that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate , while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate . this latter property can be illustrated by a simple example . suppose we are dealing with particles ( such as electrons ) of semi-integral spin ( spin angular momentum ) for which there are only two possible values : positive or negative . then , a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin , relative to two different directions ( e.g . , x and y ) results in a pair of incompatible quantities . suppose that the state ɸ of a certain electron verifies the proposition `` the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive . `` by the principle of indeterminacy , the value of the spin in the direction y will be completely indeterminate for ɸ . hence , ɸ can verify neither the proposition `` the spin in the direction of y is positive `` nor
the proposition `` the spin in the direction of y is negative . `` nevertheless , the disjunction of the propositions `` the spin in the direction of y is positive or the spin in the direction of y is negative `` must be true for ɸ .

william stanley jr. ( november 28 , 1858 – may 14 , 1916 ) was an american physicist born in brooklyn , new york . in his career , he obtained 129 patents covering a variety of electric devices . in 1913 , he also patented an all-steel vacuum bottle , and formed the stanley bottle company .


== early life ==
stanley was born november 28 , 1858 in brooklyn , ny , the son of william stanley and elizabeth a. parsons stanley . william jr. attended williston seminary and later graduated from yale university with the class of 1881 .


== career ==
stanley was as an electrician working with tele keys and fire alarms of an early manufacturer . in philadelphia , stanley designed one of the first electrical installations ( at a fifth avenue store ) . shortly thereafter , george westinghouse hired stanley as his chief engineer at his pittsburgh factory .
in 1885 , stanley built the first practical alternating current transformer based on lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs ' prototype of 1881 . this device was the precursor to the modern transformer . in december , under a new contract with westinghouse , stanley moved his operations to great barrington , massachusetts.in 1886 , on march 20 , stanley demonstrated the first complete system of high voltage alternating current transmission , consisting of generators , transformers and high-voltage transmission lines . his system allowed the distribution of electrical power over wide areas . he used the system to light offices and stores along the main street of great barrington - the location of his west avenue family home . stanley 's transformer design became a prototype for future transformers , and his ac distribution system formed the basis of modern electrical power distribution . his work in the electrification of great barrington 's main street was named an ieee milestone.agreeing that the ac system had arrived , westinghouse further tested the system in summer 1886 in pittsburgh ; it transmitted over a distance of 3 miles , and used an alternator designed by stanley to replace the siemens model , which regulated voltage poorly . satisfied with the pilot system , westinghouse began commercial production and shipped his company 's first commercial to buffalo ny , where a local utility placed it in service . orders for 25 alternating-current plants followed within months.in 1890 , stanley founded the stanley electric manufacturing company in pittsfield , massachusetts . in 1903 the general electric corporation purchased a controlling interest in the firm . the land on which the company once stood is now the site of the william stanley business park of the berkshires in pittsfield .

== life ==
he was the fourth and youngest son of the rev . zachariah mudge , by his first wife , mary fox , and was born at bideford , devon . he was educated at bideford and plympton grammar schools , and studied medicine at plymouth hospital .
several invitations were made to mudge to try his fortunes in london . but he preferred to remain at plymouth , where he practised for the remainder of his life , first as surgeon , and , after 1784 , when he received the degree of m.d . from king 's college , aberdeen , as a physician .
mudge inherited a friendship with the family of sir joshua reynolds , and when in 1762 samuel johnson accompanied reynolds on his visit to plymouth , johnson became a friend and consulted mudge as a physician . another intimate friend was john smeaton . other allies and guests of mudge were james ferguson , the astronomer , and james northcote , originally a chemist 's assistant , who owed him his position in reynolds 's studio .


== telescopes ==
on 29 may 1777 mudge was elected a fellow of the royal society , and in the same year was awarded the copley medal for his ‘ directions for making the best composition for the metals for reflecting telescopes ; together with a description of the process for grinding , polishing , and giving the great speculum the true parabolic curve , ’ which were communicated by the author to the society , and printed in the philosophical transactions ( 1777 , lxvii . 296 ) . the ‘ directions ’ were also issued separately by bowyer ( london , 1778 ) . sir john pringle , the president , in making the presentation , remarked that isaac newton had predicted the role of mechanical devices in making parabolic mirrors .
the manufacture of telescopes continued to occupy much of his spare time . he made two large ones with a magnifying power of two hundred times ; one of these he gave to hans moritz von brühl , and it passed to the gotha observatory , the other descended to his son william mudge .

nicolaas samuelszoon kruik ( latin : nicolaus samuelis cruquius ; 2 december 1678 , west-vlieland – 5 february 1754 , spaarndam ) , also known as klaas kruik and nicolaes krukius , was a dutch land surveyor , cartographer , astronomer and weatherman . he is remembered most today for the museum de cruquius bearing his name .
he was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in fahrenheit from 1706 to 1734 . his historical calculations are still used today by the knmi , the dutch meteorological institute . he not only measured weather changes in wind speed , rainfall , air pressure , temperature , and humidity , but also measured sea level . his method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth ( isobaths ) in his map of the merwede ( 1728 ) was the first of its kind . he was an advocate of pumping out the haarlemmermeer ( haarlem lake ) , which was done a century after his death .


== biography ==

he became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps , a lucrative job in his day . though born in vlieland , he moved to delft a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations . in 1717 at the age of 39 , though firmly established as a respected surveyor , he moved to the family farm in rijnsburg outside leiden and chose to study in leiden under herman boerhaave , at that time the most famous scientist in the netherlands . he signed himself in as `` krukius , medical student , born in delft `` . thanks to boerhaave , kruik became a member of the royal society of london . the secretary of the royal society at that time , james jurin , started the first european network of meteorological weather stations , and the dutch members played a large part . kruik was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1724.in 1721 and 1723 luigi ferdinando marsigli travelled to holland and he and boerhaave stimulated kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health . kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work . on these trips he was sometimes accompanied by boerhaave and marsigli . while studying the merwede , he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the netherlands dry .
it was at this time that kruik changed his name to the latin cruquius after his first publications of maps and measurements . in 1725 he wrote a famous letter to willem 's gravesande , a dutch professor of physics and astronomy at leiden , proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the netherlands . this letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the united provinces to create a water defence plan in 1727 . it was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of haarlemmermeer bij pumping the haarlem lake dry more than a century later .

in 1733 he became a member of the 'hoogheemraadschap rijnland ' , the dutch waterboard agency , and worked as a waterboard inspector in spaarndam . it was here that he met jan noppen ( 1706–1734 ) , the halfweg inspector , who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in zwanenburg with measurements 3 times daily of temperature , air pressure , humidity , and rainfall .
an eccentric man , kruik wrote music , and had an obsessive need to measure things . this need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily . according to contemporary accounts , only boerhaave could successfully work with him .

granger 's early collaboration with princeton geologist and paleontologist william j. sinclair produced a series of detailed and perceptive stratigraphic contributions . this research , published primarily in the years 1911–1914 , established the first mammalian biostratigraphy of the paleocene-early eocene of the san juan basin , new mexico and of the eocene of the bighorn and wind river basins in wyoming .
in 1920 he started a major study of the fossils and geology of the lowest beds of the brule formation in the badlands , then called the red layer . sinclair was not only an excellent vertebrate paleontologist but also an excellent geologist . sinclair ( 1923 ) was one of the first to consider the detailed origin of the white river bone beds on the basis of the lithographic content and postmortem ( taphonomic ) features of the fossil bones . he carefully recorded the vertical positions of the fossils within the lower brule formation and documented changes in the fauna .
sinclair was a protégé of william b. scott and secured funding for princeton 's william berryman scott fund for research in vertebrate paleontology . sinclair willed his large petroleum-derived estate to establish princeton 's sinclair professorship of vertebrate paleontology . the first holder of this professorship was glenn lowell jepsen ( 1903–1974 ) .

joseph gaertner ( 12 march 1732 – 14 july 1791 ) was a german botanist , best known for his work on seeds , de fructibus et seminibus plantarum ( 1788-1792 ) .


== biography ==
he was born in calw , and studied in göttingen under albrecht von haller . he was primarily a naturalist , but also worked at physics and zoology . he travelled extensively to visit other naturalists . he was professor of anatomy in tübingen in 1760 , and was appointed professor of botany at st petersburg in 1768 , but returned to calw in 1770 .
gaertner made back cross to convert one species into another . back cross increases nuclear gene frequency
his observations were :
1 . dominance of traits
2 . equal contribution of male and female to the progeny
3 . no variation in f1 ( first generation of descendants )
4 . large variation in f2 ( second generation of descendants ) including parental and intermediate types
5 . some of f2 plants had entirely new traits
but he was unable to give possible explanation for observed data but which was brilliantly done by mendel

julius sachs writes `` [ h ] e gives us the impression of a modern man of science more than any other botanist of the 18th century , with the exception of koelreuter . he knew how to communicate with clearness of language and perspicuity of arrangement whatever he gathered of general importance from each investigation ... . [ h ] is great work was at once an inexhaustible mine of single well-ascertained facts , and a guide to the morphology of the organs of fructification and to its application to systematic botany . ``


== de fructibus ==
by 1770 he had already begun work on his de fructibus et seminibus plantarum , but thereafter he gave himself up almost entirely to it , becoming nearly blind through his persistent studies , partly with the microscope . the work 's minutely accurate descriptions , comprising a thousand and more species , introduced a new era in plant morphology . the scientific value of the book was much increased by the addition of 180 copper-plate engravings.the genus of plants gaertnera in rubiaceae was named after him .

charles brenton huggins ( september 22 , 1901 – january 12 , 1997 ) was a canadian-american physician , physiologist and cancer researcher at the university of chicago specializing in prostate cancer . he was awarded the 1966 nobel prize for physiology or medicine for discovering in 1941 that hormones could be used to control the spread of some cancers . this was the first discovery that showed that cancer could be controlled by chemicals .


== early life and education ==
huggins was born in halifax , nova scotia , canada . he graduated from acadia university with a ba degree in 1920 . he went on to study medicine at harvard medical school and received his md degree in 1924 . he served his internship and residency in general surgery with frederick a. coller at the university of michigan .


== work ==
huggins established a method to measure the effect hormone changes have on prostatic function . he found out that castration or estrogen administration led to glandular atrophy , which could be reversed by re-administration of androgen . in 1941 the beneficial effect of androgen ablation on metastatic prostate cancer was realised when huggins and clarence hodges treated patients by either castration or estrogen therapy . they monitored the prostate size and therapeutic efficacy by measuring serum prostatic acid phosphatase levels and concluded that androgenic activity in the body influences prostate cancer , at least with respect to serum phosphatase . huggins was the first to use a systemic approach to treat prostate cancer .
huggins was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine on october 13 , 1966.huggins died 1997 in chicago , illinois at the age of 95 years . his wife died in 1983 .

abu 'abd allah muhammad ibn saalih ibn muhammad ibn sulayman ibn abd al rahman al uthaymeen al tamimi ( arabic : أبو عبد الله محمد بن صالح بن محمد بن سليمان بن عبد الرحمن العثيمين التميمي ) ( march 9 , 1925 – january 10 , 2001 ) was a salafi scholar of saudi arabia who has been called `` a giant within conservative salafi islam `` .


== influence ==
al-uthaymin is still considered an influential cleric within the salafist movement . due to his eclectic approach of quoting from all various schools of law within sunni islam , readers are faced with a seemingly monolithic edifice of islamist scholarship ; while some of his views are without precedent , they are still considered definitive by many salafists today , especially those in egypt .
al-uthaymin was cited by adel al-kalbani and abd al-aziz ibn baz against suicide bombing .


== controversial fatwas ==
a fatwa he issued was posted on the fatwa website islamqa.info stated that muslim women should not use pain-relieving medication during labour and delivery as it may be a plot against muslims `` because the more births take place in this manner , the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman , and she becomes unable to get pregnant . `` uthaymeen also controversially supported the idea that the green dome of madinah should be destroyed and the graves of the islamic prophet muhammad as well as his companions , abu bakr and umar , should be flattened.in another fatwa , uthaymeen claimed that someone who abandons the prayer leaves islam and that it is therefore forbidden to remain with a husband or a wife who no longer prays.according to uthaymeen women should be banned from driving as this `` would lead the free-mixing of men and women at traffic lights , petrol stations , police checkpoints as well as other car-related encounters . ``

william d. kearfott ( january 12 , 1864 – november 12 , 1917 ) was an american engineer and amateur entomologist . kearfott was educated in primary schools in richmond and philadelphia and was connected with the morton poole company and the international navigation company in his early career . kearfott was also associated with the worthington steam pump company and was considered an authority on his branch of engineering.kearfott also worked on lepidoptera , especially tortricidae and built up a large collection .
kearfott had a peculiar approach to naming new species , using a very orderly , alphabetical fashion , resulting in specific names such as : bobana , cocana , dodana , etc . because kearfott 's names were published in widely distributed scientific journals and his species were adequately described and diagnosed , his names are valid . however , his naming practices were not deemed appropriate by other entomologists ; edward meyrick even responded to kearfott 's work with a paper called `` on some impossible scientific names in micro-lepidoptera `` , published in 1912 . in this paper meyrick described kearfott 's names as `` openly and obviously based on a barbarous and unmeaning gibberish . `` meyrick rejected kearfott 's names and proposed new `` appropriate `` latin names to replace them . because the names are valid however , this led to the creation of many synonyms.his collection of tortricidae is now in the american museum of natural history , while his collection of pyralidae went to the william barnes collection , which is now at the smithsonian .

== near-discovery of radioactivity ==
in 1804 the german chemist adolph ferdinand gehlen ( 1775-1815 ) had noticed that when a solution of uranium chloride in ether was exposed to sunlight , it quickly changed color ( from bright yellow to green ) and precipitated . in the 1850s , niépce de saint-victor was trying to develop color photography , using light-sensitive metal salts . beginning in 1857 , long before henri becquerel 's famous serendipitous discovery of radioactivity in 1896 , niépce de saint-victor observed that , even in complete darkness , certain salts could expose photographic emulsions . he soon realized that uranium salts were responsible for this anomalous phenomenon . ( photographers in france , england , and germany soon confirmed niepce 's findings regarding uranium . ) niépce recognized that the `` light `` that was exposing his photographic plates was neither conventional phosphorescence nor fluorescence : the salts could expose photographic plates long after the salts had last been exposed to sunlight . niépce 's superior , michel eugène chevreul , recognized the phenomenon as a fundamental discovery ( `` une découverte capitale `` ) , pointing out that uranium salts retained their power to expose photographic plates even after six months in the dark ( `` encore actif six mois après son insolation `` ) . by 1861 , niépce stated frankly that uranium salts emitted some sort of radiation that was invisible to the human eye : original : `` … cette activité persistante … ne peut mème pas être de la phosphorescence , car elle ne durerait pas si longtemps , d'après les expériences de m. edmond becquerel ; il est donc plus probable que c'est un rayonnement invisible à nos yeux , comme le croit m. léon foucault , … . `` translation : `` … this persistent activity … can not be due to phosphorescence , for it [ i.e . , phosphorescence ] would not last so long , according to the experiments of mr. edmond becquerel ; it is thus more likely that it is a radiation that is invisible to our eyes , as mr. léon foucault believes , … . ``
note especially that niépce mentions `` edmond becquerel `` , the father of henri becquerel , who would later be credited with the discovery of radioactivity . indeed , in 1868 , edmond becquerel published a book , la lumière : ses causes et ses effets ( light : its causes and its effects ) , in which he mentioned niépce 's findings ; specifically , that objects that were coated with uranium nitrate could expose photographic plates in the dark .

== the beginnings of the msnc ==
the beginning of the menc was an invitation by hayden to come together in keokuk and observe his work there . the invitation resulted from the cancellation of the 1906 meeting of the national education association because of the san francisco earthquake . the second meeting of the new group was held in indianapolis in 1909 , but a constitution was not adopted until 1910 in cincinnati , where the group officially became the music supervisors national conference . the appearance of the organization at a time when it could contribute to the expansion of american society in the second and third decades of the twentieth century was due to the foresight of p.c . hayden .

john h. tietjen ( june 18 , 1928 – february 15 , 2004 ) was a lutheran clergyman , theologian , and national church leader in the united states . he is best known both for his role in the seminex controversy which roiled the lutheran church–missouri synod ( lcms ) in the mid-1970s , and for his efforts on behalf of lutheran unity that resulted in the formation of the evangelical lutheran church in america ( elca ) .


== life and work ==
tietjen was born in new york city as a son of german immigrants , and he attended stuyvesant high school , concordia collegiate institute ( now concordia college , bronxville ) , and concordia seminary in st. louis , missouri . he also earned master 's and doctorate degrees at union theological seminary in new york . after being ordained in the lcms in 1953 , tietjen rose through the synod ranks and eventually was chosen as president of its largest seminary , concordia seminary , in 1969 .
while president of concordia seminary , tietjen and many of the concordia faculty members faced opposition from a new , more conservative administration of the lcms . the faculty 's use of historical-critical method for biblical interpretation was cast by conservatives as being at odds with the historic theological position of the lcms . tietjen was accused of allowing the teaching of false doctrine , and he was suspended from his duties as seminary president in january 1974 .
as a result , tietjen and the majority of the seminary faculty formed a rival seminary which they dubbed concordia seminary in exile , or seminex . seminex existed in st. louis until august 1983 , and on the campus of the lutheran school of theology at chicago ( lstc ) until december 1987 . meanwhile , tietjen and many of his supporters left the lcms to form the more liberal association of evangelical lutheran churches ( aelc ) . during the early 1980s , tietjen and the aelc organized unity talks among several other lutheran church bodies , eventually leading to the formation of the evangelical lutheran church in america ( elca ) , which today is the largest lutheran church body in the united states .


== personal life ==
in 1953 , john tietjen married ernestine catherine dammitts ( 1925-2015 ) and had four children , catherine , laurence , mary , and sarah . he also has seven grandchildren jessica , jennifer , carrie , rachel , joseph , elizabeth , and chase . john tietjen battled lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , blood clots , and finally a brain tumor . he died in the comfort of his own home . during the last few months before his death he was working on a final book titled the gospel according to jesus . the original transcripts were typed , edited by his peers , and published by a private individual to create his new book .

walter george woolnough was `` temporary `` adviser to the commonwealth government from 1927 to 1941 . after visiting north american and argentinian oilfields in 1930 , he encouraged the use of aerial surveys and aerial photos in the search for oil , which he believed would be found in commercial quantities in australia and new guinea . in 1932 woolnough recognised the dome-like structure of rough range , exmouth gulf , scene of an oil discovery in 1953 . his papers on sedimentation in barred basins were influential in oil exploration circles .
a graduate of sydney university , woolnough accompanied edgeworth david to funafuti atoll in 1897 , and worked in fiji in 1901 and 1905 , recognising the essentially `` continental `` character of these islands . however his first visit there resulted in a legacy of recurrent thrombosis , which troubled throughout his career .
woolnough lectured at adelaide and sydney universities to 1911 , and in that year he joined j.a . gilruth 's expedition to the northern territory , subsequently publishing an important bulletin on the territory and a geological map of the northern portion , based on h.y.l . brown 's earlier work , but with considerable additions by woolnough .
he became foundation professor of geology at the university of western australia in 1913 , remaining there until 1919 . in western australia he made major studies of `` duricrust `` , a term he coined and on other aspects of geomorphology . woolnough then joined brunner mond alkali company to seek economic salt deposits in australia . he travelled widely , and despite the physical disabilities that barred him from a place on scott 's polar expedition in 1910 , and from war service , he covered vast distances ( 1 000 miles on foot in seven weeks ) in his work . he was not averse to using camel , bicycle , horse or car however .
woolnough reviewed the then known iron ore occurrences of australia for the commonwealth , and because of the apparent limited supply an embargo ( lasting until 1960 ) was placed on export of iron ore , a year before his retirement in 1941.after retiring woolnough carried out consulting for the next ten years , but turned increasingly to bibliographic and translating work , as his health deteriorated , and supported himself by translating scientific articles from more than a dozen languages . the first d.sc . of sydney university he was honoured by numerous other organisations . his name is commemorated in the woolnough lecture theatre at uwa , woolnough hills , w.a . , the woolnough geological library at the university of new england and a sea-mount south east of sydney .

gaston vandendriessche ( 28 november 1924 – 14 october 2002 ) was a belgian psychologist , best known for his extensive study on the so-called haizmann case , first analyzed by sigmund freud in 1923 .
vandendriessche was born in roeselare . he studied psychology at the university of leuven and published his doctoral thesis , het haizmann-geval van sigmund freud : onderzoek betreffende het grondmateriaalen de psychologische interpretaties , in 1962 , and continued to research and write on the haizmann case until the 1990s in dutch , french , german and english language .
his best-known work is probably the book the parapraxis in the haizmann case of sigmund freud from 1965 . according to h. c. erik midelfort , this book is a “ devastating demolition of freud ’ s interpretation ” but he also thinks that vandendriessche is “ careful and respectful ” in his argumentation .
vandendriessche served as a professor of psychology at the university of leuven . he died in 2002 in leuven , aged 77 .

= heinrich barkhausen =
heinrich georg barkhausen ( 2 december 1881 – 20 february 1956 ) , born in bremen , was a german physicist.growing in a patrician bremen family , he showed interest in natural sciences from an early age . he studied at the technical university of munich ( 1901 ) , tu berlin ( 1902 ) and university of munich ( 1903 ) and berlin before obtaining a doctorate at the university of göttingen in 1907.he became professor of electrical engineering at the technische hochschule dresden in 1911 at the age of 29 , thus obtaining the world 's first chair in this discipline .
in 1919 , he discovered the barkhausen effect ( named after him ) , which provided evidence for the magnetic domain theory of ferromagnetism . when the magnetic field through a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is changing , the magnetization of the material changes in a series of tiny discontinuous jumps , which can be heard as a series of clicks in a loudspeaker attached to a coil of wire around the iron . it was later determined that these jumps were caused by the movement of the magnetic domains in the iron , as the domain walls snap past defects in the crystal lattice . the energy lost in these dissipative events is responsible for the shape of the hysteresis curve of iron and other ferromagnets . this effect is widely used in research , and physics education as a simple experiment to demonstrate the reality of magnetic domains .
in 1920 , he invented the barkhausen-kurz oscillator , with k. kurz , the first vacuum tube electronic oscillator to use electron transit-time effects . it was the first vacuum tube oscillator that could operate at ultrahigh frequency , up to 300 mhz , and inspired later microwave transit-time tubes such as the klystron.in 1921 he derived the first mathematical conditions for oscillation in electrical circuits , now called the barkhausen stability criterion . they are widely used today in the design of electronic oscillators and general feedback amplifier circuits .
in 1933 barkhausen signed the loyalty oath of german professors to adolf hitler and the national socialist state .

lewandowsky coined the term `` blood–brain barrier `` in 1900 , referring to the hypothesized semipermeable membrane which separated the human central nervous system from the rest of the body 's vasculature , and which prevented the entry of certain compounds from entering the brain when injected into the bloodstream . two years earlier , researchers arthur biedl and r. kraus had formed a similar hypothesis when low-concentration `` bile salts `` failed to affect behavior ( and thus , in theory , had failed to enter the brain ) when injected into the bloodstream of animals.beginning in 1910 he , together with alois alzheimer , edited the journal zeitschrift für die gesamte neurologie und psychiatrie . he was also editor of a handbook of neurology , handbuch der neurologie ( 1910–14 ) .
