= john barclay ( anatomist ) =
john barclay ( 10 december 1758 – 21 august 1826 ) was an eminent scottish comparative anatomist , extramural teacher in anatomy , and director of the highland society of scotland .


== life ==
he was born in cairn , perthshire 10 december 1758 , the son of a farmer , and nephew of john barclay , who established the berean church .
he was educated at muthill parish school .
barclay initially studied divinity at the university of st andrews , and served as a minister . then working as a family tutor , he educated himself in biological topics and anatomy . pupils of his entered the university of edinburgh in 1789 , and barclay became an assistant there to john bell the anatomist , and was also associated with his brother charles bell . his employer sir james campbell financed the completion of his medical course.barclay qualified m.d . at edinburgh , before studying anatomy under andrew marshall for a year in london . he returned to edinburgh and established himself as an anatomical lecturer in 1797 . until 1825 he delivered two complete courses of human anatomy , a morning and an evening one , every winter session , and for several years before his death gave a summer course on comparative anatomy . his classes gradually grew in reputation ; in 1804 he was formally recognised as a lecturer on anatomy and surgery by the edinburgh college of surgeons , and in 1806 he became a fellow of the edinburgh college of physicians.when a new chair of comparative anatomy for the university of edinburgh was proposed in 1816 , barclay was the leading candidate . however , the proposal was defeated by the concerted opposition of a number of the incumbent medical professors , led by john hope , robert jameson and alexander monro , tertius , who feared the new chair would encroach on their own prerogatives . this episode provided the subject of a memorable caricature by john kay .

barclay supported his former pupil william dick when he established his dick veterinary school .
for the final two years of his life barclay was too ill to teach , during which his classes were carried on by robert knox , another former pupil.he died at argyll square in edinburgh on 21 august 1826 , and was buried in restalrig churchyard on the east side of the city .

barclay contributed the article physiology to the third edition of the encyclopædia britannica ( 1797 ) . he developed ideas for a nomenclature of human anatomy based on scientific principles in a new anatomical nomenclature ( 1803 ) . in 1808 he published a treatise on the muscular motions of the human body , arranged according to regions and systems , and with applications to surgery . this was followed in 1812 by his description of the arteries of the human body , the result of original study and dissection . a second edition appeared in 1820.he furnished descriptive matter to a series of plates illustrating the human skeleton and the skeletons of some animals , engraved by edward mitchell of edinburgh in 1819–20 . several of his lectures on anatomy were published posthumously in 1827 . another work was an inquiry into the opinions , ancient and modern , concerning life and organisation , published in 1822 . in this work barclay gives a spirited defense of vitalism against a catalogue of thinkers he considered to be advocates of materialistic theories of life , including erasmus darwin , william lawrence and jean-baptiste fray . [ 1 ] the noted scottish zoologist and geologist john fleming wrote that concerning life and organization `` should be perused with care by every student of anatomy and natural history , as an effective preservative against the doctrines of materialism `` .he wrote remarks on mr. john bell 's anatomy of the heart & arteries under the name `` jonathan dawplucker , esq . ``


== family ==

his first botanical collections were made in and about hamburg as well as on the north sea coastline . through his collecting he became acquainted with professor lehmann of the hamburg botanical gardens , who invited klatt to organise and run his herbarium . lehmann acted as mentor to klatt , who soon concentrated his attention on the botanical families of iridaceae and pittosporaceae . his subsequent revision of the iridaceae `` revisio iridearum `` led to his being awarded an honorary doctorate from the university of rostock and an offer of a professorship which he declined .
klatt contributed sections on iridaceae to several publications — `` conspectus florae africae `` by durand & schinz , `` flora brasiliensis `` by martius , `` symbolæ ad floram brasiliæ centralis cognoscendam `` by eugenius warming and `` baron carl claus von der deckens reisen in ost-afrika in den jahren 1859 bis 1865 `` ( `` karl klaus von der decken 's travels in east africa in 1859–65 `` ) . klatt 's greatest interest though , lay with the compositae , and his publications on this family covered german east africa , madagascar , australia , brazil , guatemala , colombia and costa rica . he corresponded with and visited kew , exchanged specimens with asa gray and managed to build up a considerable personal collection . in addition to his collection , he made detailed drawings of a large number of the specimens , especially type specimens , that were sent to him for identification . in 1877 john gilbert baker named the genus klattia ( family iridaceae ) in his honor.after klatt 's death , his herbarium specimens were bought by and donated to the gray herbarium and the botanical institute of the university of hamburg . this botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation klatt when citing a botanical name .

in 1939 hollaender published research showing that the mutations of spores of the ringworm fungus occurred in the same spectrum as the absorption spectrum of nucleic acids indicating that nucleic acids form the building blocks of genes . a young esther m. zimmer , who worked with dr. hollaender at the u. s. public health service ( bethesda , md ) , published with dr. hollaender and milislav demerec in this very early field of x-ray- and uv-induced mutations . later on , esther m. zimmer ( now esther lederberg ) became one of the most influential founders of bacterial and bacteriophage ( lambda ) genetics . later on , hollaender worked at oak ridge national laboratories with m. laurance morse , who himself later went on to collaborate with esther lederberg .
his research was not appreciated for its discovery at the time , and later scientists reports were necessary before science accepted the role of nucleic acids as the genetic material . historians of science now realize his early discovery , and his fermi award recognized this discovery.in 1981 hollaender established the council for research planning in biological sciences , and was its president at the time of his death from a pulmonary embolism in 1986 . the us national academy of sciences gives the alexander hollaender award in biophysics every three years in his honor .

sir frederick walker mott ( 23 october 1853 in brighton , sussex – 8 june 1926 in birmingham , warwickshire ) was one of the pioneers of biochemistry in britain . he is noted for his work in neuropathology and endocrine glands in relation to mental disorder , and consequently as psychiatrist and social scientist . he was croonian lecturer to the royal college of physicians for the year 1900.the maudsley hospital in london was mott 's idea , inspired by emil kraepelin 's clinic in germany , and mott conducted the negotiations for its funding and construction . he ran the pathology laboratory which was transferred there , and treated shell shock patients during world war i . his reputation had been greatly enhanced by helping establish that 'general paralysis of the insane ' was actually due to syphilis , but he has been criticised for overly organic and degenerative assumptions in regard to mental illness including shell shock . after the war , in a lecture to the eugenics education society , he claimed that shell shock was rare in volunteers as opposed to regular conscripted men , and that it was not a new disorder but merely a variation occurring in those already predisposed.mott , like maudsley , appears to have held that mental illness was inherited due to degenerate family lines that worsened until dying out , though his selecting of cases and statistics were questioned by other eugenicists . mott advanced an overarching theory that mental disease was due to pathology of the sexual reproductive system , as evidenced for example by atrophied testes , causing breakdown of cerebral neurons in certain parts of the brain .

william joseph oswald ( july 6 , 1919 – december 8 , 2005 ) was an american educator , scientist , and engineer who spent his entire academic career at the university of california , berkeley in the departments of civil and environmental engineering and public health . he made foundational contributions to the fields of wastewater treatment and applied phycology , or as he called it , `` algology `` . throughout a career spanning more than five decades , oswald was the primary academic advisor to more than two dozen doctoral students , sat on more than 100 additional masters and doctoral thesis committees , and taught seminal courses in applied algology .


== early life , military service , and education ==
oswald was born in king city , california in 1919 . he grew up on a ranch in that area , where the arid climate stoked his interest in water supplies , wastewater treatment , and water use . in world war ii , he served in the army air forces and was responsible for water safety at one of the d-day invasion camps . oswald remained in the army in europe after the war , working in a hospital where he cared for patients suffering from waterborne ailments and met his lifelong wife , an american nurse . returning home to california , he obtained a degree in civil engineering from the university of california , berkeley in 1950 on the g.i . bill . he then continued his studies and was awarded an m.s . ( 1951 ) and ph.d. ( 1957 ) in sanitary engineering , biology and public health . oswald joined the faculty of the university the same year and went on to become a full professor in 1970 . he remained in the position his entire career , staying on as an emeritus professor after his retirement .


== career ==
oswald studied the role of algae in wastewater treatment as a student , winning recognition from the american society of civil engineers for his early work . he continued investigating the use of microalgae in sanitation throughout his career , developing strategies for combining engineered algae ponds to obtain specific water treatment goals . he developed the `` high rate pond system `` of shallow , mixed raceway ponds to maximize algae productivity . this design is still in use today , responsible for over 90 % of the world 's commercial microalgae production . his work led to the development of the `` advanced integrated wastewater pond system `` , in which wastewater flows through a series of ponds , starting with deeper `` facultative `` ponds , then high rate ponds , and finally maturation ponds . the research undertaken by oswald and his students and collaborators provided the foundations for much of modern microalgae wastewater treatment technology . wastewater treatment plants based on his designs operate throughout the world today.with broader implications in energy and nutrient cycles , oswald ’ s work often crossed over into related fields such as waste energy recovery , biofuels , animal feeds , and waste nutrient reuse . the air force ’ s interest in waste and nutrient recycling for long term space missions led to oswald ’ s development of the algatron–a device that would grow microalgae on astronaut waste , treating water and also producing oxygen and food.an archive of oswald 's work is maintained by former student and long time collaborator tryg lundquist , now a professor of environmental engineering at cal poly , san luis obispo .


== awards and honors ==
oswald was recognized throughout his career . he received the harrison prescott eddy medal in 1953 from the water pollution control federation ( now known as the water environment federation ) for describing photosynthetic oxygenation . the american society of civil engineers awarded him both the rudolf hering medal and the james croes medal in 1957 for work describing the fixation of nutrients and capture of solar energy by microalgae and the arthur m. wellington award in 1966 for various investigations of life support systems for extended space travel . in 2005 he was awarded the lifetime achievement prize of the international society for applied phycology and in 2006 he was nominated for the stockholm water prize .

ernst julius richard ewald ( 14 february 1855 – 22 july 1921 ) was a german physiologist born in berlin . he was a younger brother to gastroenterologist carl anton ewald ( 1845-1915 ) .
in 1880 , after finishing his studies in mathematics , physics and medicine , he became an assistant to physiologist friedrich goltz ( 1834-1902 ) at the university of strasbourg . in 1900 he succeeded goltz as chair of physiology at strasbourg , a position he maintained until 1918 .
ewald is best remembered for his research of the vestibular system of the inner ear , which largely involved experiments performed on the semicircular canal system of pigeons . from these studies the so-called `` ewald laws `` are derived , which deal with the effects of endolymph motion on body , head and eye movements and also on the phenomena of excitation-inhibition asymmetries in the vestibular system .
ewald 's first law : `` the axis of nystagmus parallels the anatomic axis of the semicircular canal that generated it `` .
ewald 's second law : `` ampullopetal endolymphatic flow produces a stronger response than ampullofugal flow in the horizontal canal `` .
ewald 's third law : `` ampullofugal flow produces a stronger response than ampullpetal flow in the vertical canals ( anterior and posterior semicircular canals ) .in 1892 he was given an award by the paris academy of sciences for his monograph `` physiologische untersuchungen über das endorgan des nervus octavus `` .

= gerard salton =
gerard a . `` gerry `` salton ( 8 march 1927 in nuremberg – 28 august 1995 ) , was a professor of computer science at cornell university . salton was perhaps the leading computer scientist working in the field of information retrieval during his time , and `` the father of information retrieval `` . his group at cornell developed the smart information retrieval system , which he initiated when he was at harvard . it was the very first system to use the now popular vector space model for information retrieval .
salton was born gerhard anton sahlmann on march 8 , 1927 in nuremberg , germany . he received a bachelor 's ( 1950 ) and master 's ( 1952 ) degree in mathematics from brooklyn college , and a ph.d. from harvard in applied mathematics in 1958 , the last of howard aiken 's doctoral students , and taught there until 1965 , when he joined cornell university and co-founded its department of computer science .
salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used vector space model for information retrieval . in this model , both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts , and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector . in this paper , he also introduced tf-idf , or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency , a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs . ( the concept of inverse document frequency , a measure of specificity , had been introduced in 1972 by karen sparck-jones . ) later in life , he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis , as well as automatic hypertext generation . he published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life .
salton was editor-in-chief of the communications of the acm and the journal of the acm , and chaired special interest group on information retrieval ( sigir ) . he was an associate editor of the acm transactions on information systems . he was an acm fellow ( elected 1995 ) , received an award of merit from the american society for information science ( 1989 ) , and was the first recipient of the sigir award for outstanding contributions to study of information retrieval ( 1983 ) -- now called the gerard salton award .

friedrich adolph wilhelm diesterweg ( 29 october 1790 – 7 july 1866 ) was a german educator , thinker , and progressive liberal politician , who campaigned for the secularization of schools . he is said to be precursory to the reform of pedagogy .


== biography ==

educated at herborn and tübingen universities 1808-1811 , diesterweg began teaching in 1811 . he taught at mannheim and at worms for about two years , and then moved to the model school in frankfurt am main . later he became rector of the latin school of elberfeld . in 1820 , he was appointed director of the new teacher 's seminary at mörs where he put in practice the methods of pestalozzi . in 1832 , he was summoned to berlin to direct the new state-schools seminary in that city . here he proved himself a strong supporter of nonsectarian religious teaching . in 1846 , he established the pestalozzi institution at pankow , and the pestalozzi societies for the support of teachers ’ widows and orphans . because of his disagreement with the authorities regarding important phases of higher education he was in constant friction and resigned from the seminary in 1847 . in 1850 , he received a government pension . thereafter , he continued to vigorously advocate his educational ideas through the medium of periodicals . in 1858 , he was elected to the chamber of deputies as member for the city of berlin , and voted with the liberal opposition .


== philosophy ==
diesterweg thought criticalness and responsibility were important in teaching , and sought to reform social , economic and moral aspects of education publishing the influential pädagogisch wollen und sollen . he based his program on what was named the `` basic principles of the struggle for life `` that he saw in the catholicism/protestantism conflict . he thought there were several 'oppositions ' ( distinct choices ) that were available in the conflict which could be reduced to a single `` authority or freedom , catholicism or protestantism `` .

in his effort to reform schooling diesterweg wanted to remove political and religious influence in the teaching itself and instead involve more of a social factor . he believed in the availability of education : `` first educate men , before worrying about their professional training or class , [ because ] the proletarian and the peasant should both be educated to become human beings `` ; he also believed that through education the poor could be helped . he wanted professionalization of state teachers and fought for the relative autonomy of schools ; he also had an influence on the teachers of that time through his newspaper rheinisch blätter .


== works ==
diesterweg was a voluminous writer on educational subjects , and was the author of various school text-books . he authored 50 books and published about 400 papers ; he has been credited with originated the phrase 'learn to do by doing ' by one source .
in 1851 , he founded the pädagogisches jahrbuch ( yearbook of pedagogy ) in berlin . among his publications were :

wegweiser zur bildung für deutsche lehrer ( guide for the instruction of german teachers ; 2 vols . , 1834 ; 6th ed . , 1 vol . , 1890 )
das pädagogische deutschland ( german pedagogy ; 1836 )

= lorenz kellner =
lorenz kellner ( born at kalteneber in the district of eichsfeld , 29 january 1811 ; died at trier , 18 august 1892 ) was a german educator .


== life ==
he was the son of heinrich kellner who had been a pupil of pestalozzi at yverdon and had introduced pestalozzi 's methods at the normal school he conducted , the first of its kind in the catholic district of eichsfeld . out of these private courses for the training of elementary school-teachers developed a seminary for teachers at heiligenstadt .
lorenz kellner graduated at the gymnasium josephinum at hildesheim , and then studied at the evangelical seminary for teachers at magdeburg . after being a teacher at the catholic elementary school at erfurt for two years , he was made rector of the school .
in 1836 his father 's normal school was enlarged into a seminary for teachers , of which the elder kellner remained the head while lorenz was made his only assistant . in 1848 von eichhorn , the prussian minister of worship and education , called lorenz to marienwerder in west prussia as member of the government district council and of the school-board . after seven years at marienwerder , kellner was summoned to fill the same offices at trier . since there were at this date no institutions for the training of teachers in trier , kellner founded several seminaries both for male and female teachers during the twenty-nine years of his official activity here .
in 1863 the academy of münster in westphalia made kellner doctor of philosophy honoris causa , in recognition of his services on behalf of the german language and of pedagogics .


== works ==
in his major work , `` praktischer lehrgang für den deutschen unterricht `` ( 1837–40 ) , the teaching of grammar was systematically connected with the reading-book . this was , for that period , a very important advance when contrasted with the current methods of grammatical instruction . in 1850 appeared his best-known work , `` zur pädagogik der schule und des hauses . aphorismen `` , which was translated into several languages . it contains altogether 178 essays which cover the entire field of training and teaching .
his `` skizzen und bilder aus der erziehungsgeschichte `` ( 3 vols . , 1862 ) was the first treatment of the history of pedagogics by a catholic author . kellner 's `` kurze geschichte der erziehung und des unterrichts `` ( 1877 ) is a book of practical suggestions for teachers ; his `` volksschulkunde `` was a theoretical and practical guide for catholic teachers of both sexes , school inspectors , and seminaries . other works were `` lebensblätter , erinnerungen aus der schulwelt `` ( 1891 ) and the posthumous `` lose blätter , pädagog . zeitbetrachtungen und ratschläge von kellner `` ( 1897 ) .

== biography ==
hansen 's father william g hansen , who was a son of immigrants from denmark , was a hardware store owner in fresno , california . he encouraged his son 's early talent in mathematics and enthusiasm for electronics . he entered stanford university at the age of 16 , earning his b.a . in 1929 and his ph.d. in 1933.hansen went on to become interested in the problem of accelerating electrons for x-ray experiments , using oscillating fields , rather than large static voltages . at the university of california , berkeley , ernest lawrence and his assistant david h. sloan , had worked on an accelerator driven by a resonant coil . hansen proposed replacing the coil with a cavity resonator . in 1937 , brothers russel h. varian and sigurd f. varian came to stanford to work on the foundations of what was to become radar . hansen exploited some of the varian 's work to develop the klystron and during the years 1937 to 1940 , along with collaborators such as john r. woodyard , founded the field of microwave electronics .
in 1941 , he moved his team to the sperry gyroscope company where they spent the war years employing their expertise in radar applications and in other problems.returning to stanford in 1945 as a full professor , he embarked on the construction of a series of linear accelerators based on klystron technology and of gev performance . along with the varian brothers and edward ginzton , he co-founded varian associates in 1948 . sadly , he was never to see the completion of the klystron project . he died at age 39 in palo alto , california of berylliosis and fibrosis of the lungs , caused by inhaling the beryllium used in his research . in 1947 , the hansen experimental physics laboratory ( hepl ) was founded as a facility at stanford university . the facility is designed to promote interdisciplinary enterprises across different branches of science and was named in his honor .


== personal life ==
in october 1938 , william webster hansen married betsy ross , who was the younger daughter of perley ason ross , professor of physics at stanford . shortly after his death betsy committed suicide . their only child died six months after his birth during the fall of 1947 .

the term netizen is a portmanteau of the words internet and citizen , as in a `` citizen of the net `` or `` net citizen . `` it describes a person actively involved in online communities or the internet in general.the term commonly also implies an interest and active engagement in improving the internet , making it an intellectual and a social resource , or its surrounding political structures , especially in regard to open access , net neutrality and free speech . the term was widely adopted in the mid-1990s as a way to describe those who inhabit the new geography of the internet . internet pioneer and author michael f. hauben is credited with coining and popularizing the term .


== quotations from michael and ronda hauben ==
hauben describes the distinction to internet users in general by saying :


== in china ==

in chinese , the terms wǎngmín ( 网民 , literally `` net-people `` ) and wǎngyǒu ( 网友 , literally `` net-friend `` ) are commonly used terms meaning `` internet users `` , and the english word netizen is used by mainland china-based english language media to translate both terms , resulting in the frequent appearance of that english word in media reporting about china , far more frequently than the use of the word in other contexts .


== the netizen prize ==

the international nonprofit organisation reporters without borders awards an annual netizen prize in recognition to an internet user , blogger , cyber-dissident , or group who has helped to promote freedom of expression on the internet . the organisation uses the term when describing the political repression of cyber-dissidents such as legal consequences of blogging in politically repressive environments .

= edwin cannan =
edwin cannan ( 3 february 1861 , funchal , madeira – 8 april 1935 , bournemouth ) , the son of david cannan and artist jane cannan , was a british economist and historian of economic thought . he was a professor at the london school of economics from 1895 to 1926 .
as a partisan of jevonianism , edwin cannan is perhaps best known for his logical dissection and destruction of classical theory in his famous 1894 tract a history of the theories of production and distribution . although cannan had personal and professional difficulties with alfred marshall , he was still `` marshall 's man `` at the lse from 1895 to 1926 . during that time , particularly during his long stretch as chairman after 1907 , edwin cannan shepherded the lse away from its roots in fabian socialism into tentative marshallianism . this period was only to last , however , until his protégé , lionel robbins , took over with his more `` continental `` ideas .
though cannan , in his early years as an economist , was a critic of classical economics and an ally of interventionists , he moved sharply to the side of classical liberalism in the early 20th century . he favored a simplicity , clarity , and common sense in the exposition of economics . according to geoffrey m. hodgson , cannan `` emphasised the institutional foundation of economic systems `` .

= ivey foreman lewis =
ivey foreman lewis ( august 31 , 1882 – march 16 , 1964 ) was an american botanist and geneticist who served for two decades as dean of the university of virginia and helped found the virginia academy of science . a proponent of eugenics throughout his career , in his final years , lewis and his sister nell battle lewis gained national attention for their opposition to racial desegregation in public education , especially the united states supreme court decisions in brown v. board of education .


== early life ==
lewis was born in raleigh , north carolina to a prominent physician and public health official richard henry lewis . he had two brothers . his father remarried twice . he had a half sister nell battle lewis . lewis earned a b.s . ( 1902 ) and m.s . ( 1903 ) at the university of north carolina , and later a phd at johns hopkins university ( 1908 ) .


== career ==
during his own post-graduate studies through johns hopkins in baltimore , maryland , lewis taught biology at randolph–macon college in ashland , virginia from 1905 to 1912 . after he received his phd , lewis accepted a position as assistant professor of botany at the university of wisconsin ( 1912 to 1914 ) . he then taught as professor of botany at the university of missouri from 1914 to 1915 .
in 1915 , university of virginia president edwin a. alderman recruited lewis , who became professor of biology and agriculture , and began to modernize the institution and increase its research output . lewis became popular at the university , as well as important in the state 's scientific community—helping to found the virginia academy of science and serving as its first president . lewis was appointed dean of the university in 1934 and ( after a reorganization ) , dean of the college of arts and sciences in 1946 , a position he held until his retirement in 1953 . he is buried at the university of virginia cemetery.lewis 's signature course was biology c1 : evolution and heredity . he provided much of the scientific rationale for the eugenics movement now best known for the discredited legal decision in buck v. bell ( 1927 ) . in the 1920s , lewis championed the state 's anglo-saxon clubs as staving off apocalyptic `` racial decay `` , including giving a lecture `` what biology says to the man of today . `` lewis thus worked with alumnus john powell , major earnest s. cox and dr. walter plecker ( a physician who as state registrar vigorously enforced the 1924 racial integrity act ) . later , he consistently advised against hiring academicians who might question his group of eugenicists , or advocate environmental solutions to social problems , or even critically examine southern traditions , as well as criticized jewish sociologists . lewis had unsuccessfully opposed admission of gregory swanson , who matriculated at the university 's law school in the fall of 1950 pursuant to a federal court order after the naacp victories in sweatt v. painter and mclaurin v. oklahoma , but swanson left about a year later after encountering the `` overwhelming climate of racial hostility and harassment `` he had experienced . thus walter n. ridley , a professor at virginia state college who arrived a semester after swanson actually became the first recipient of a postgraduate degree at uva ( his phd in education was the first such awarded a black man from a major southern institution ) . during virginia 's massive resistance crisis , mostly after his retirement , lewis attempted to `` hold the line `` and limit desegregation to token individuals , taking an active part in the radical defenders of state sovereignty and individual liberties .
lewis was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , and served as president of the american society of naturalists ( 1939 ) , american biological society ( 1942 ) , and the botanical society of america ( 1949 ) . the standard author abbreviation i.f.lewis is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

robert anderson cooke ( 1880–1960 ) was an american immunologist and allergist.in 1916 cooke and albert vandeveer demonstrated the role of heredity in the origins of allergy . according to cooke , 48 % of his allergic patients had allergies in their family history . while the trait of allergy is transmitted through heredity , parents and children may be allergic to different substances .
in 1918 , dr. cooke suggested a mechanism of action for allergen injections as a `` desensitization or hyposensitization , `` analogous to tolerance achieved in experimental anaphylaxis induced in animals . this concept suggested that the injections of an increasing amount of allergen or antigen slowly neutralized those antibodies responsible for the allergic reaction .

= giovanni maria lancisi =
giovanni maria lancisi ( 26 october 1654 – 20 january 1720 ) was an italian physician , epidemiologist and anatomist who made a correlation between the presence of mosquitoes and the prevalence of malaria . he was also known for his studies about cardiovascular diseases , and is remembered in the eponymous lancisi 's sign .


== biography ==
giovanni maria lancisi ( latin name : johannes maria lancisius ) was educated at the collegio romano and the university of rome , where he qualified in medicine aged 18 . he was physician to popes innocent xi , clement xi and innocent xii . he was given the lost anatomical plates of bartolomeo eustachius by pope clement xi ; these were made in 1562 and had been forgotten in the vatican library . lancisi edited and published them in 1714 as the tabulae anatomicae . he studied epidemiology , describing malaria and influenza epidemics . he published de noxiis paludum effluviis ( on the noxious effluvia of marshes ) in 1717 , in which he recognized that mosquito-infested swamps are the breeding ground for malaria and recommended drainage of these areas to prevent it . he also published extensively on cardiology , describing vegetations on heart valves , cardiac syphilis , aneurysms and the classification of heart disease . his landmark de motu cordis et aneurysmatibus was published posthumously in 1728.early in the 18th century , lancisi had protested the medieval approaches to containing rinderpest in cattle by stating that `` it is better to kill all sick and suspect animals , instead of allowing the disease to spread in order to have enough time and the honour to discover a specific treatment that is often searched for without any success `` ( mantovani and zanetti , 1993 ) . lancisi who made the first breakthrough in the control of rinderpest ( lancisi , 1715 ) , a procedure that was later adopted by thomas bates ( bates , 1718 ) .
however , lancisi also erred , as he disputed the work of giovanni cosimo bonomo ( 1663-1696 ) , his contemporary , who had correctly identified the cause of scabies as a parasite . lancisi however felt scabies was of humoral origin . because of lancisi ’ s powerful position and , because previous scientists like galileo galilei had fallen into disgrace , bonomo was silenced and his discovery was forgotten until the modern era .


== brain & soul inquiries ==
lancisi described the corpus callosum as the `` seat of the soul , which imagines , deliberates and judges . `` his dissertatio physiognomica provided the supporting argument in 1713 . he opposed alternative locations of the soul as hypothesized by others , such as the centrum ovale , by andreas vesalius , and the pineal gland , by rené descartes . he hypothesized that the longitudinal striae ( later named in his honor as the `` striae lancisi `` or `` nerves of lancisi `` ) were the conduit between the anterior location of the soul , and the posterior location of sensory organ functions , both within the corpus callosum .

victor augustin isidore dechamps ( 6 december 1810 , in melle – 29 september 1883 , in mechelen ) was a belgian archbishop of mechlin , cardinal and primate of belgium .


== biography ==
he and his brothers made rapid progress in science under their father 's direction . one , adolphe deschamps , entered on a political career . victor pursued his ecclesiastical studies first at the seminary of tournai and then in the catholic university begun at mechlin and afterwards transferred to louvain .
ordained priest 20 december 1834 , he entered the congregation of the most holy redeemer in 1835 , and made his vows 13 june 1836 . the next four years he spent at wittem as prefect of students and lector in dogmatic theology . in 1840 he began his missionary life and in 1842 was nominated rector at liège . he took an active part in the founding of the confraternity of the holy family , which he considered his most salutary work . in the historic jubilee of liège he had a large share both by his `` le plus beau souvenir de l'histoire de liège `` , and by his preaching ( 1845–46 ) .
he visited england and saw the effects of the tractarian movement . in 1849 he was nominated consultor general of his congregation , and took up his residence at pagani near naples just when pope pius ix was in exile at gaeta . he had several audiences with the pope and was instrumental in arranging the transfer of the superior general from pagani to rome . this was not effected till 1855 , when pius ix invited father dechamps to the first general chapter held in rome . the question of his appointment to the see of liège was considered in 1852 , but the pope , touched by his personal appeal , did not insist . in 1865 dechamps became bishop of namur , whence he was transferred in 1875 to the archdiocese of mechlin and made primate .
he took an active part in the formation of the pontifical zouaves , and persuaded general lamoricière to offer his services to pius ix . he battled for catholic schools and defended papal infallibility before and during the vatican council . cardinal manning and dechamps were indefatigable ; and they became cardinals in the same consistory , 15 march 1875 . cardinal deschamps was appointed cardinal-priest of san bernardo alle terme . dechamps worked to the very end . he said mass on 28 september 1883 , and died the day following in the arms of a redemptorist who happened to be present . he was buried , as he had desired , by the side of joseph passerat at rumilliers .
the complete works of dechamps , revised by himself , were published in seventeen volumes at mechlin . in presenting fourteen of the seventeen volumes to pope leo xiii on 7 february 1879 , the author writes : `` there is one thing that consoles me , holy father , in sending you my poor works : they are all consecrated to the truths of our holy faith ... . volume i is consecrated to the truths of faith ; ii to our lord jesus christ ; v to the blessed virgin mary ; iii and iv to the church and st. peter ; vi to the pope and his infallibility ; vii , viii , and ix to the refutation of modern errors ; x , xi , xii , xiii , and xiv to my preaching as bishop and to acts by which i governed my diocese . `` of the remaining volumes , xv , `` mélanges `` , deals with many important questions ; xvi and xvii contain letters on questions in philosophy , theology , and other subjects .
cardinal dechamps 's brother , adolphe deschamps , served as minister of public works from 16 april 1843 to 30 july 1845 , and as minister of foreign affairs until 12 august 1847 .

== early life ==
born into a semi-aristocratic family in basel in 1905 , stueckelberg 's father was a lawyer , and his paternal grandfather a distinguished swiss artist . a highly gifted school student , stueckelberg initially began a physics degree at the university of basel in 1923 .


== career ==
while still a student , stueckelberg was invited by the distinguished quantum theorist arnold sommerfeld , to attend his lectures at the university of munich . he went on to gain a ph.d. on cathode physics in 1927 . later that year he went to princeton university , becoming an assistant professor in 1930 .
he returned to switzerland in 1932 , working first at the university of basel before switching the following year to the university of zurich . in 1934 he moved again to the university of geneva , which together with the university of lausanne became his principal bases for the rest of his career .
stueckelberg 's sojourn in zurich led to contact with leading quantum theorists wolfgang pauli and gregor wentzel , which in turn led him to focus on the emerging theory of elementary particles .
in 1934 he devised a fully lorentz-covariant perturbation theory for quantum fields . the approach proposed by stueckelberg was very powerful , but was not adopted by others at the time , and has now been all but forgotten . however , besides being explicitly covariant , stueckelberg 's methods avoid vacuum bubbles.stueckelberg developed the vector boson exchange model as the theoretical explanation of the strong nuclear force in 1935 . discussions with pauli led stueckelberg to drop the idea , however . it was rediscovered by hideki yukawa , who won a nobel prize for his work in 1949 — the first of several nobel prizes awarded for work which stueckelberg contributed to , without recognition.in 1938 stueckelberg recognized that massive electrodynamics contains a hidden scalar , and formulated an affine version of what would become known as the abelian higgs mechanism . he also proposed the law of conservation of baryon number.the evolution parameter theory he presented in 1941 and 1942 is the basis for recent work in relativistic dynamics .
in 1941 he proposed the interpretation of the positron as a positive energy electron traveling backward in time.in 1943 he came up with a renormalization program to attack the problems of infinities in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , but his paper was rejected by the physical review.in 1952 he proved the principle of semi-detailed balance for kinetics without microscopic reversibility.in 1953 he and the mathematician andré petermann discovered the renormalization group.in 1976 he was awarded the max planck medal.his phd students included marcel guénin .

miles was educated at harrow . he joined the british indian army in 1857 , the year of the indian mutiny . he entered the 7th regiment of bombay native infantry as an ensign , was promoted to lieutenant in 1860 and became regimental quarter-master in 1864 . in november 1866 he moved with his regiment to aden . the next year he was appointed cantonment magistrate and assistant resident at aden .


== political agent in the gulf region ==
the regiment returned to india in march 1869 . soon after , miles applied for a transfer to the political service .
his first appointment was to balochistan , where he stayed on the makran coast .
miles was appointed political agent and consul at muscat , in oman , in october 1872 .
he spent most of his subsequent career as a political agent in oman .
other appointments included political agent in turkish arabia , consul-general of baghdad ( 1879 ) , political agent and consul-general of zanzibar ( 1881 ) , political agent in the north west province and oudh ( 1885 ) and political resident in the persian gulf.miles came to oman during the reign of turki bin said ( 1871–1888 ) , whom the british had assisted in ending the conservative religious revolution of azzan bin qais .
miles made several journeys from muscat into the interior of the country to gain a better understanding of the people for diplomatic purposes . he was an arabist and orientalist , and developed a deep knowledge of the history and the people of the region , recording his findings in copious notes .
he described the country , architecture , local customs , social conditions , agriculture and fishing .
his erudition allowed him to detect echoes of the distant past in modern times .
he noted that india and arabia still used a measure of weight that had been used in ancient nineveh .


== later career ==
miles was acting political resident in the gulf from 1885 until october 1886 .
in 1887 he returned to india where he was promoted to colonel . he was political resident at mewar from 1887 to 1893 , when he retired from the army and returned to england .
miles wrote several papers that were published by the royal geographical society .
he married ellen marie kay in 1877 . they had one son , harry william miles , who was killed during world war i ( 1914–1918 ) .samuel barrett miles died on 28 august 1914 aged 75 .
he had intended to work up his notes into a book , but went blind several years before he died .
five years later his widow published the work he had completed as the countries and tribes of the persian gulf .

= anna gillingham =
anna gillingham ( 1878–1963 ) was an educator and psychologist . working with dr. samuel orton , she trained teachers and published instructional materials regarding reading instruction , producing the orton-gillingham approach to reading instruction . with bessie stillman , she wrote what has become the orton–gillingham manual : remedial training for children with specific disability in reading , spelling and penmanship . first published in 1935/6 , this work is updated and republished regularly . along with the help of stillman , gillingham developed a “ sequential , alphabetic-phonetic multisensory program ” as a tool with which students could easily create meaningful syllables . this approach eliminated the need for a child to memorize almost all words in language , limiting it to those that were non-phonetic . this teaching manual for the “ alphabetic method ” of orton ’ s theories combined multisensory techniques with teaching the structure of written english , including sounds ( phonemes ) , meaning units ( morphemes such as prefixes , suffixes , and roots ) and common spelling rules .
anna gillingham devoted her life to the maxim that in teaching , “ one should establish associations involving the simplest possible units and should use various reinforcement techniques ” to create solid association links . alongside the practicing and development of her techniques , gillingham began working with dr. henry goddard – known for his adaptation and translation of the french simon and binet tests for use in determining superior intelligence , thus becoming the first school psychologist in the country .
after giving up her quest for a ph.d. , gillingham and stillman set out on the methodical sorting of the english language . they sorted words that contain various single phonograms , digraphs and diphthongs , and those that follow particular patterns of syllable division . they developed spelling rules and exceptions , determined which spellings of vowel sounds occurred with the greatest frequency , and then developed procedures for mastering nonphonetic words . at the age of 69 gillingham began work as a consultant for several schools in the country to supervise her remedial and preventative programs , train teachers for individual student teaching , and train classroom teachers .
to align her methods with the new editions of webster 's dictionary , which altered pronunciation of final syllables in many words and completely abandoned older rules of syllable division , gillingham attempted ( at the age of 80 years ) to conform her work to the latest linguistic principles . examples of the change in syllable division and final syllabic changes are as follows :

another key aspect reinforced by gillingham ’ s teaching career is her adherence to the theory that too early exposure to reading and writing may be harmful to children . the roots of her beliefs in this come from her own childhood , having spent the first ten years of her life on a sioux reservation in south dakota . on her school experience gillingham wrote , “ my parents believed in my having as wide general knowledge as possible before being introduced to the symbolism of written language…i believe that such postponement of reading and writing would be a great saving of the child ’ s and taxpayer ’ s money . ”

= karl young ( theatre historian ) =
karl young ( november 2 , 1879 – november 17 , 1943 ) was an american professor of english , medievalist , and theatre historian . young 's theory of the liturgical origins of dramatic performance gained wide acceptance in the later twentieth century .


== life and career ==
young was born in clinton , iowa ; his father was lawyer and his grandfather a presbyterian clergyman . he grew up in ypsilanti , michigan and graduated from high school there . he attended the university of michigan as an undergraduate and went on to get a master 's degree ( 1902 ) and doctorate ( 1907 ) at harvard university . during his graduate studies , he taught at the naval academy in annapolis for two years , then returned to harvard to finish the doctorate . after taking his ph.d. ( the chaucer society published his dissertation on troilus and criseyde in 1908 ) , he taught from 1908 to 1923 at the university of wisconsin–madison . the high point in his career were the two decades spent on the faculty at yale university ( 1923–1943 ) . in 1933 , he became a member of the american academy of arts and sciences . in 1940 , he was elected president of the modern language association ; he received several honorary doctorates and prizes , among them the gollancz memorial prize in 1941 .
young 's research on what he called `` liturgical drama `` began with a publication in 1908 ; he relied heavily on charles magnin 's notion that modern european theatre performance originated in the catholic mass , in the quem quaeritis trope . this thesis , also propagated and widely disseminated by léon gautier , was brought to an even wider and anglophone audience through young 's the drama of the medieval church ( 1933 ) , which was reprinted several times and often taught at universities . later scholars criticized young 's model , claiming that it misunderstood the diverse and manifold liturgical culture of medieval christianity , in which certain roles and tropes are legitimate elements of the liturgy and not necessarily self-conscious dramatic performance . indeed , later generations re-examined notions of `` performance `` to such a degree , that young 's theses became difficult to propagate.he died in new haven , connecticut ; a collection of his personal notes and scholarly files ( mostly concerning medieval liturgy ) is a part of the holdings at yale university music library .

= ingeborg beling =
ingeborg beling was a german ethologist from the early 20th century who worked in the field of chronobiology . she studied at the university of munich under the direction of karl von frisch and is known for her research on the time sense of honey bees .
in her research , in 1929 , she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day , day after day . this contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees ’ 24-hour biological clock . because of this achievement , she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists . beyond honeybees , much of beling ’ s work involved studying behaviors of wasps , fly pupae , etc . finally , she also did some research in pest control .


== bee-feeding experiment ( 1929 ) ==
beling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper , titled `` über das zeitgedächtnis der bienen `` ( “ on the time memory of bees ” ) published in the journal of comparative physiology , that the early observations of forel , v. buttel-reepen and dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees , termed zeitgedächtnis , or time memory . in her pioneer experiments , beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish , which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day ( for example , between 4 and 6 pm ) . during the testing phase , the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded . she found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time , even when the sugar water was removed . specifically , beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning . further more , she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day , and even for multiple times a day . however , beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours , but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested . these results were still present when beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity , temperature , light and radiation .


== contributions to chronobiology ==
beling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time . she found that this time memory is both rigorous ( the bees consistently show up at the expected time ) and flexible ( the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day , even two or three times a day ) . beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours . this 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous , helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day . the bees ' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day , the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response . beling ’ s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments .


== related terms ==
much of the early work in chronobiology was done in germany , so publications were largely written in german . some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today . the father of chronobiology , colin pittendrigh , critiqued these terms , saying that researchers in munich have trouble letting go of these terms . he argues that ‘ training ’ and ‘ memory ’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior .


== related chronobiologists ==
beling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees . her work grew from the observations of previous scientists ( forel , buttel-reepen , von frisch ) and helped inspire further experimentation ( wahl , renner ) . standing on the shoulders of these researchers , pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology .

= theodor meynert =
theodor hermann meynert ( 15 june 1833 – 31 may 1892 ) was a german-austrian psychiatrist , neuropathologist and anatomist born in dresden . meynert believed that disturbances in brain development could be a predisposition for psychiatric illness and that certain psychoses are reversible .
in 1861 he earned his medical doctorate , and in 1875 became director of the psychiatric clinic associated with the university of vienna . some of his better known students in vienna were josef breuer , sigmund freud , who in 1883 worked at meynert 's psychiatric clinic , and julius wagner-jauregg , who introduced fever treatment for syphilis . meynert later distanced himself from freud because of the latter 's involvement with practices such as hypnosis . meynert also ridiculed freud 's idea of male hysteria ; though some authors believe this to be due to his own hidden suffering of the illness , prompting a reconciliation with freud near to his death . other famous students of meynert 's were russian neuropsychiatrist sergei korsakoff ( 1854–1900 ) , german neuropathologist carl wernicke ( 1848–1905 ) and swiss neuroanatomist auguste-henri forel ( 1848–1931 ) . meynert 's work was an important influence in the career of german neuropathologist paul flechsig ( 1847–1929 ) .


== brain research ==
meynert 's work was largely focused on brain anatomy , pathology and histology , including the mapping of its intricate pathways and topography . he made many contributions involving the study of the cellular architecture of the brain and is often considered to be the founder of cerebral cortex cytoarchitectonics .
meynert developed theories in regards to correlations between neuroanatomical and mental processes . he conceptualized that a coupling between one mental association and its temporal successor as a literal contact between cortical nerve cells linked to one other by nerve fibers , and a series of cortical associations could therefore be construed as being a `` train of thought `` . he also theorized that ideas and memories are to be envisioned as being attached to specific cortical cells .

in regards to mental illness , meynert conceptualized that a conflict existed between the cerebral cortex and the sub-cortical regions as the primary cause for abnormal function of cerebral components . also he formulated that a causal connection existed between cerebral pathologies and psychoses due to a lack of `` cerebral nutrition `` related to vasomotor functionality . meynert 's aim was to establish psychiatry as an exact science based on anatomy . in his 1884 textbook psychiatrie . klinik der erkrankungen des vorderhirns , meynert forewords with the statement : `` the reader will find no other definition of 'psychiatry ' in this book but the one given on the title page : clinical treatise on diseases of the forebrain . the historical term for psychiatry , i.e . , 'treatment of the soul , ' implies more than we can accomplish , and transcends the bounds of accurate scientific investigation . ``


== anatomical terms ==
he has several anatomical structures named after him , including the basal optic nucleus of meynert , the substantia innominata of meynert and `` meynert cells `` , which are solitary pyramidal cells located in the cerebral cortex near the calcarine fissure . in 1869 meynert described the dorsal tegmental decussation of the left and right tectospinal and tectobulbar tracts , located in the mesencephalon ( midbrain ) . this was to become known as `` meynert 's decussation `` or as `` fountain decussation `` .

slowinski was born on november 15 , 1962 in new york city , new york . he attained his bachelor 's degree in biology from the university of kansas in 1984 and went on to receive his ph.d. at the university of miami in 1991 , studying under herpetologist jay m. savage . he performed postdoctoral work at the national museum of natural history and louisiana state university , eventually taking a position as a professor of biology at southeastern louisiana university .
slowinski was a founder of the first online herpetological journal , contemporary herpetology , and served as its editor-in-chief . he was also the curator for the department of herpetology for the california academy of sciences . his primary area of research was venomous snakes , having written some 40 peer-reviewed articles and one book .


== death and legacy ==
on september 11 , 2001 , while researching in an isolated region of myanmar , slowinski was bitten by a juvenile multi-banded krait ( bungarus multicinctus ) . he died 29 hours later after his team , which included mark w. moffett , made several failed attempts to obtain medical attention . the weather that night was particularly bad , preventing a helicopter from transporting slowinski to a hospital , and making it impossible to carry medical supplies to the campsite .
a biography of slowinski titled the snake charmer was written in 2008 by jamie james .
three species have been named after slowinski : a species of north american corn snake ( pantherophis slowinskii ) , a species of bent-toed gecko native to myanmar ( cyrtodactylus slowinskii ) , and a species of krait native to vietnam ( bungarus slowinskii ) .

stahl is remembered for his pioneer experiments in the field of ecophysiology , as well as research involving the developmental history of lichens . he was able to induce the synthesis of the lichen endocarpon pusillum from spores and algal material , including formation of apothecia , and thus he made a strong experimental case for the hypothesis by simon schwendener ( 1829-1919 ) that lichens are twin fungal-algal organisms.other contributions by stahl included studies concerning the influence of light on plants — he described the anatomy of sun and shade leaves ; the effects of moisture and dryness on the formation of leaves , and the role of stomata in xerophytes and mesophytes . he conducted important research on the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and tree roots , and also worked on plant defense against snail and slug herbivory and a plethora of other botanical and ecological questions .

== life ==
olabide was born in 1869 in vitoria , álava , spain , to a couple who lived on the plaza de la virgen blanca in the center of the city , where they ran a small business . though both his parents were ethnically basque , his mother had been born and raised in madrid , and her native tongue was castillian . as a result , he grow up speaking only that language . when he came of age , his parents sent him to the jesuit college in urduña.in 1884 , at the age of 15 , olabide entered the society of jesus which operated the school . he then pursued his philosophical and theological studies at the jesuit communities of veruela abbey and tortosa . in the course as his formation with the society , he worked as a teacher in valladolid , oña , gijon and salamanca . he was ordained a catholic priest in 1902.it was while studying at the university of salamanca in 1911 that olabide came across a grammar book of basque written by arturo campión , a leading proponent of basque nationalism . it was then finally that , at the age of 27 , he began to learn his mother tongue , to the study and promotion of which he dedicated the rest of his life . the noted basque lexographer who had published a classic dictionary of the language in 1904 , resurrección maría de azkue , later commented that olabide seemed to know his work better than he himself , the author , did .

william sealy gosset ( 13 june 1876 – 16 october 1937 ) was an english statistician , chemist and brewer who served as head brewer of guinness and head experimental brewer of guinness and was a pioneer of modern statistics . he pioneered small sample experimental design and analysis with an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty . gosset published under the pen name student and developed most famously student 's t-distribution – originally called student 's `` z `` – and `` student 's test of statistical significance `` .


== life and career ==
born in canterbury , england the eldest son of agnes sealy vidal and colonel frederic gosset , r.e . royal engineers , gosset attended winchester college before matriculating as winchester scholar in natural sciences and mathematics at new college , oxford . upon graduating in 1899 , he joined the brewery of arthur guinness & son in dublin , ireland , where he would spend the rest of his 38-year careerin his job as head experimental brewer at guinness , the self-trained gosset developed new statistical methods – both in the brewery and on the farm – now central to the design of experiments , to proper use of significance testing on repeated trials , and to analysis of economic significance ( an early instance of decision theory interpretation of statistics ) and more , such as his small-sample , stratified , and repeated balanced experiments on barley for proving the best yielding varieties . gosset acquired that knowledge by study , by trial and error , by cooperating with others , and by spending two terms in 1906–1907 in the biometrics laboratory of karl pearson . gosset and pearson had a good relationship . pearson helped gosset with the mathematics of his papers , including the 1908 papers , but had little appreciation of their importance . the papers addressed the brewer 's concern with small samples ; biometricians like pearson , on the other hand , typically had hundreds of observations and saw no urgency in developing small-sample methods.gosset 's first publication came in 1907 , `` on the error of counting with a haemacytometer , `` in which – unbeknownst to gosset aka `` student `` – he rediscovered the poisson distribution . another researcher at guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the guinness brewery . the economic historian stephen ziliak discovered in the guinness archives that to prevent further disclosure of confidential information , the guinness board of directors allowed its scientists to publish research on condition that they do not mention `` 1 ) beer , 2 ) guinness , or 3 ) their own surname `` . to ziliak , gosset seems to have gotten his pen name `` student `` from his 1906–1907 notebook on counting yeast cells with a haemacytometer , `` the student 's science notebook `` thus his most noteworthy achievement is now called student 's , rather than gosset 's , t-distribution and test of statistical significance .

gosset published most of his 21 academic papers , including the probable error of a mean , in pearson 's journal biometrika under the pseudonym student . it was , however , not pearson but ronald a. fisher who appreciated the understudied importance of gosset 's small-sample work . fisher wrote to gosset in 1912 explaining that student 's z-distribution should be divided by degrees of freedom not total sample size . from 1912 to 1934 gosset and fisher would exchange more than 150 letters . in 1924 , gosset wrote in a letter to fisher , `` i am sending you a copy of student 's tables as you are the only man that 's ever likely to use them ! `` fisher believed that gosset had effected a `` logical revolution `` . in a special issue of metron in 1925 student published the corrected tables , now called student 's t

george young ( 15 july 1777 – 8 may 1848 ) was a scottish divine , scholar and flood geologist .


== biography ==
george young was born in kirknewton south-west of edinburgh to john young and his wife jean . george was born without a left hand and this situation led his parents to educate him for the ministry.at the university of edinburgh he distinguished himself in mathematics and natural philosophy . he was a favorite student of professor john playfair who was , at that time , becoming the great promoter of james hutton 's uniformitarian geology . after receiving high honors upon completion of his degree in 1796 , he studied theology under dr george lawson at selkirk for five years , receiving at the end of this period a licence to preach from the presbytery of glasgow . in 1806 he became the pastor of the cliff street chapel in whitby where he served for 42 years . he obtained an m.a . degree from the university of edinburgh in 1819 . in 1826 he married margaret hunter . though married for 20 years they had no children .
young could read and write hebrew , greek , latin , french , and italian with some acquaintance with arabic , chaldean and syriac , and he developed his own shorthand , which is still undecipherable . he helped establish whitby museum as the first secretary and a founding member of the whitby literary and philosophical society . he procured fossil and mineral collections for the yorkshire philosophical society .
young wrote twenty-two books on many topics : inter alia , the history of whitby ; the great solar eclipse of 1836 ; an acclaimed biography of captain james cook ; the downfall of napoleon ; and , a catalog of hardy garden plants .
with john bird as artist he wrote a geological survey of the yorkshire coast in 1822 published in whitby . this book remains in print in facsimile . a second edition ( 1828 ) was printed and published in the north of england , edinburgh , and london . the second edition contains seventeen plates : numbers one to fifteen , and number seventeen , are on one page , and number sixteen is a two-page spread . the plates are hand-coloured with watercolour : brush-strokes are clearly visible . the effect is exquisite and may reflect young 's passion for geology , and bird 's art.the title was followed by scriptural geology in 1838 .
george young was immersed in fossil collecting and selling . he helped preserve preserving the yorkshire philosophical society and museum . he promoted fossil collecting saying , `` the researches of the geologist are far from being unworthy of the christian , or the philosopher : for , while they enlarge the bounds of our knowledge , and present a wide field for intellectual employment and innocent pleasure , they may serve to conduct us to the glorious being . `` r.j. cleevely stated that young `` questioned many of the facts concerning fossils , sedimentation and geological time ” of the yorkshire coast , such as the facts that the strata had been deposited by water , and that the horizontally deposited strata had become tilted by some violent force . young did not object to these facts , but to interpretations of them by contemporary geologists.on 8 may 1848 , two years after the death of his wife , george young died of influenza at the age of 71 years .

= beno gutenberg =
beno gutenberg ( ; june 4 , 1889 – january 25 , 1960 ) was a german-american seismologist who made several important contributions to the science . he was a colleague and mentor of charles francis richter at the california institute of technology and richter 's collaborator in developing the richter magnitude scale for measuring an earthquake 's magnitude .


== early life ==
gutenberg was born in darmstadt , germany , and obtained his doctorate in physics from the university of göttingen in 1911 . his advisor was emil wiechert . during world war i , gutenberg served in the german army as a meteorologist in support of gas warfare operations.gutenberg held positions at the university of strasbourg , which he lost when strasbourg became french in 1918 . after some years during which he had to sustain himself with managing his father 's soap factory , he obtained in 1926 a junior professorship at university of frankfurt-am-main , which was poorly paid .
although he was already , in the 1920s , one of the leading seismologists worldwide and definitely the leading seismologist in germany , he was still dependent on the position in his father 's factory ; however , he continued his research in his spare time .


== professor ==
in 1928 , the attempt to become the successor of his academic teacher , emil wiechert , in göttingen , failed . there are hints that gutenberg 's jewish background might have played a role because , already in the 1920s , there were strong antisemitic tendencies in german universities . for similar reasons , he was also not accepted for a professorship in potsdam to become the successor of gustav angenheister .
since gutenberg could not sustain a career of scientific work in germany , he accepted a position as professor of geophysics at the california institute of technology in pasadena in 1930 , becoming founding director of the seismological laboratory when it was transferred to caltech from carnegie . even if he had obtained a full professorship in germany , he would have lost it in 1933 anyway like so many other scientists of jewish ancestry , at least 30 of whom emigrated to the united states under gutenberg 's sponsorship .


== research ==
gutenberg , especially in his collaboration with charles francis richter , made the california institute of technology seismological laboratory the leading seismological institute worldwide . collaborating with richter , gutenberg developed a relationship between seismic magnitude and energy , represented in this equation :

= spiros zodhiates =
spiros zodhiates ( greek : σπύρος ζωδιάτης ; march 13 , 1922 – october 10 , 2009 ) was a greek-american bible scholar , author , and ministry innovator . he was best known for his work in developing amg ( advancing the ministries of the gospel ) international , a christian missions and relief agency with operations in over 40 countries , and for publishing the hebrew-greek keyword study bible which indexes key terms in the english bible with the words they were translated from in the original languages .


== life ==
zodhiates was born of greek parents on the island of cyprus . his father first brought the family to port said , egypt and then khartoum , sudan , looking for work . spiros 's brother , argos zodhiates , was converted to protestant christianity after hearing an evangelical preacher and brought this witness to his mother and brother , who also became convinced of its truth . after neglecting to kiss a greek orthodox priest 's hand , zodhiates was expelled from school . a lady named katherine took pity on him and volunteered to teach the boy english .
after completing his greek education , he attended the american university in cairo , egypt , received his th.b . degree from the national bible institute ( later shelton college , which closed its doors in 1990 ) in new york city , and his m.a . from new york university . in 1978 he earned his doctor of theology degree from luther rice seminary of jacksonville , florida . he was also the recipient of several honorary doctorates .
he came to the united states in 1946 at the invitation of the american committee for the evangelization of the greeks ( now amg international ) , of which he became president in 1966 . under zodhiates ' leadership , amg grew from a small ministry focusing on the land of greece to a worldwide evangelistic and relief ministry . amg , founded in 1943 in new york city and presently located in chattanooga , tennessee , provides a wide range of social services , including care for orphans and leprosy patients , and has an expanding evangelistic thrust of “ advertising the message of the gospel ” through paid newspaper and magazine gospel messages in many lands and languages .
in 1951 , zodhiates ’ passion for radio was born when he realized the power of media to get the message of christianity to the masses . using his greek background and knowledge of the greek language as a springboard , zodhiates took to the airwaves , teaching the new testament in light of the original greek meaning of the words used . zodhiates ’ program , new testament light , began on one station in rural pennsylvania , and in its heyday was heard across the united states and canada . as his career progressed , zodhiates became a recognized authority on the greek new testament . his bible teaching carried from radio into other media as well . in 1975 , he launched pulpit helps magazine , a monthly publication designed to provide pastors with insights from the original languages of the bible , tips on sermon construction , illustrative stories to enhance bible teaching , and news from christian missions around the world . pulpit helps still serves thousands of readers in the united states and other english-speaking countries . new testament light was developed into a television show during the 1980s and was broadcast on numerous stations through the mid-1990s .


== books ==
in addition to the hebrew-greek keyword study bible , zodhiates published over 200 books and booklets in english , as well as 82 in greek , many of which are in-depth word-by-word commentaries on the books of the new testament . he started a book house , amg publishers , which has since grown into a significant producer of christian books , to publish much of his material . he was also responsible for introducing the modern greek pronunciation of classical and koine greek into u.s. colleges and universities through a guide to modern greek pronunciation and his tape recordings of the entire koine new testament ( nestle 's text ) in modern greek pronunciation . he recorded with modern greek pronunciation special courses on new testament greek for those who wish to learn it on their own or in classrooms , using texts such as j. gresham machen 's new testament greek for beginners , summers ' , davis ' , and hadjiantoniou 's grammars .
after suffering numerous health problems in the late 1990s , zodhiates transitioned out of active work , though many of his commentary manuscripts are still being edited and published , and his radio and television recordings are being redistributed digitally . he died in chattanooga on october 10 , 2009 .

marcello stefano pirani ( july 1 , 1880 – january 11 , 1968 ) was a german physicist known for his invention of the pirani vacuum gauge , a vacuum gauge based on the principle of heat loss measurement . throughout his career , he worked on advancing lighting technology and pioneered work on the physics of gas discharge .


== biography ==
marcello pirani was born on july 1 , 1880 , in berlin . starting in 1899 , he studied mathematics and physics at the university of berlin . in 1903 , he was granted a phd for his measurements of the dielectric constant of solids in the group of emil warburg . he then moved to the technical university of aachen as an assistant at the physikalischen institut of this university .
in 1904 , he joined the light bulb factory ( glühlampenwerk ) of siemens & halske ag in berlin where he remained for the next fifteen years . at the age of 25 , in 1905 , he was promoted head of the development lab of the light bulb factory .
in 1906 , he made his most important invention with the development of a new type of vacuum gauge that today bears his name , the pirani gauge . it is based on measuring the pressure dependence of heat loss from a hot wire by heat transfer to the surrounding gas and walls . in particular , it employs the change in resistivity of the heated wire ( in pirani ’ s original work consisting of tantalum and platinum , today , tungsten , platinum or nickel is commonly used ) with temperature to determine the heat loss . its useful measurement range lies within 10−4mbar up to 1000mbar .
four years later , he finished his habilitation on optical measurements of high temperatures and studies on the relationship between temperature and emissivity of hot solids and becomes private docent at the technical university berlin-charlottenburg . during the first world war , he enlisted in the army to deal with scientific-technical problems such as wireless telegraphy .
in 1918 , pirani was promoted titular-professor at the tu berlin-charlottenburg . one year later , he co-founded the deutsche gesellschaft für metallkunde ( german society for metal science ) in berlin .
from 1919 to 1936 , he worked for the newly formed osram company . as head of the scientific-technical bureau , he was in charge of coordinating and pushing scientific work in the field of light bulbs of the three founding companies siemens & halske , aeg and the auergesellschaft . in this time fall his pioneering contributions to the advancement of lighting technology , in particular in the field of gas-discharge lamps : in 1922 , he was named außerordentlicher professor at the tu berlin . in 1928 , he became head of the studiengesellschaft for electrical lighting of the osram gmbh . he wrote a textbook on heat generation from electrical sources in 1930 .
as his mother — clara schönlank — was jewish , with the rise of the nazi party to power in germany he left germany in 1936 for england and joined the research lab of general electric co. ltd. in wembley . there his work focused on gas discharge lamps and high temperature resistant materials . from 1941 to 1947 , he served as scientific consultant for the british coal utilization research association in london , working on new high temperature resistant materials involving carbon . between 1947 and 1952 , he was scientific consultant for the british-american research ltd. , also in london .
in 1953 , he returned to germany as one of the few second world war repatriates with scientific background and moved first to munich and from 1955 to his hometown berlin . in 1954 , he took up a consultant position with osram working on problems in gas discharge , glass and ceramics up to an old age .

maximilien chaudoir , or maximilien , baron de chaudoir , ( 12 september 1816 , ivnitsa , near zhitomir – 6 may 1881 , amélie-les-bains ) was a russian entomologist . he was a specialist in coleoptera and in particular the carabidae . his cicindelidae are conserved by the muséum national d'histoire naturelle in paris . his carabidae were acquired by charles oberthür ( 1845-1924 ) , then given to the same museum . he wrote mémoire sur la famille des carabiques , 6 volumes commencing 1848 .


== life and work ==
chaudoir was born in ivnitza , about 30 kilometres from jitomir , ukraine . the family may come from a line of french protestant emigrants who fled in 1685 or from belgium . the subsequent roots have been traced to antoine de chaudoire from poland whose son worked in the court of stanislas-auguste poniatowski until his abdication in 1795 after which he moved to bavaria where he received the hereditary title of baron from maximilien joseph ii in 1814 . his son stanislav ( 1790-1858 ) married aglae d'erggelet and maximilien was their only son . stanislav was a wealthy collector who donated his books and collectibles to the hermitage museum . maximilien was raised by his aunt as his mother died after his birth . jean wavre , a private tutor introduced him to natural history and insects . he began collecting carabid beetles in 1826 . he was sent to study law at tartu ( dorpat ) , although not interested in law , he knew that j.f . eschscholtz taught zoology there . unfortunately for him , eschscholtz died a few weeks before he joined the university , and chaudoir began to work on his collections at the museum . he was encouraged by count gustave de mannerheim and in 1834 he travelled around germany and met louis chevrolat in hamburg . he became a member of the entomological society of france in 1834 . he moved to kiev and then joined the societe imperiale des naturlistes de moscou in 1837 . in 1845 chaudoir visited crimea and became interested in the caucasus region . in 1847 he became a member of the entomologische verein , stettin . in 1848 he bought the faldermann collection followed by another collection of himalayan beetles from captain boys in 1850 and still later gory 's collection in 1852.he married elisabeth-augusta bockshanine on february 28 , 1856 . they had a daughter and a son . his daughter marie however died in 1879 at the age of 22 from tuberculosis . chaudoir died from a stroke on 6 may 1881 and was buried next to his daughter in their family vault at amelie-bains-palalda . his wife died in 1896 at jitomir and their son died without issue in 1919 . before his death he let his collection be available to rene oberthür through his friend charles oberthür . this collection eventually went to the muséum national d'histoire naturelle in paris .

where ε is the depth of the potential well , σ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero , r is the distance between the particles , and rm is the distance at which the potential reaches its minimum . at rm , the potential function has the value −ε . the distances are related as rm = 21/6σ ≈ 1.122σ . these parameters can be fitted to reproduce experimental data or accurate quantum chemistry calculations . due to its computational simplicity , the lennard-jones potential is used extensively in computer simulations even though more accurate potentials exist .


== explanation ==
the r−12 term , which is the repulsive term , describes pauli repulsion at short ranges due to overlapping electron orbitals , and the r−6 term , which is the attractive long-range term , describes attraction at long ranges ( van der waals force , or dispersion force ) .
differentiating the l-j potential with respect to r gives an expression for the net inter-molecular force between 2 molecules . this inter-molecular force may be attractive or repulsive , depending on the value of r. when r is very small , the molecules repel each other .
whereas the functional form of the attractive term has a clear physical justification , the repulsive term has no theoretical justification . it is used because it approximates the pauli repulsion well and is more convenient due to the relative computing efficiency of calculating r12 as the square of r6 .
the l-j potential is a relatively good approximation . due to its simplicity , it is often used to describe the properties of gases and to model dispersion and overlap interactions in molecular models . it is especially accurate for noble gas atoms and is a good approximation at long and short distances for neutral atoms and molecules .
the lowest-energy arrangement of an infinite number of atoms described by a lennard-jones potential is a hexagonal close-packing . on raising temperature , the lowest-free-energy arrangement becomes cubic close packing , and then liquid . under pressure , the lowest-energy structure switches between cubic and hexagonal close packing . real materials include body-centered cubic structures also.the lennard-jones ( 12,6 ) potential was improved by the buckingham potential ( exp-6 ) later proposed by richard buckingham , incorporating an extra parameter and the repulsive part is replaced by an exponential function :

=== networked thinking ===
vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking , a combination of cybernetic and systemic ideas and complexity . central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects , leading to emergent behavior of the system as a whole . these networks can be described by using protocols , mathematical networks , computer software , so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations , including positive and negative feedback loops . simulations of systemic networks can help to decide the long-term effects of singular measures .


=== the sensitivity model ===
vester 's sensitivity model combines these ideas , and has been used since the 1980s in studies by ford , unesco and other organizations .


== publications ==
most of vesters books were published in german as well as in other languages , though seldom in english . a list of his works includes :

1976 , ballungsgebiete in der krise ( urban systems in crisis )

enrico barone ( italian : [ baˈroːne ] ; 22 december 1859 , naples , kingdom of the two sicilies – 14 may 1924 , rome , italy ) was a soldier , military historian , and an economist .


== biography ==
barone studied the classics and mathematics before becoming an army officer . he taught military history for eight years from 1894 at the officers ' training school . there he wrote a series of influential historical military works . in these he employed a method of successive approximations to which his study in economics had introduced him . in 1902 , he became head of the historical office of the general staff . he resigned his commission in 1906 .
from 1894 he collaborated with maffeo pantaleoni and vilfredo pareto in the giornale degli economisti .


== impact ==
he was the first to state conditions under which a competitive market would be pareto efficient . he introduced variable factor proportions into neoclassical economics , contributing to the marginal-productivity theory of factor-income distribution . he extended conditions of general equilibrium in walrasian theory , suggesting the feasibility of trial-and-error movement to market equilibrium . he pioneered the economic theory of index numbers . his contributions were made without use of utility or even indifference curves .

barone has been described as a `` founder of the pure theory of a socialist economy . `` in 1908 , he presented a mathematical model for a socialist economy under which certain relations , later identified with shadow prices , must be satisfied for `` maximum collective welfare . `` the latter corresponds to least-cost-price of production from pareto efficiency reached in competitive equilibrium . he stressed that such a result could not be arrived at a priori but only by experimentation on a large scale with great demands on data collection , even assuming unchanging productive conditions . in this , he suggested that movement toward economic efficiency in a socialist economy was not inconceivable , outlining two types of socialism : a centralized and decentralized model . for such regimes , whatever the distribution rule for output and income adopted by the ministry of production , the same economic categories would reappear for prices , salaries , interest , rent , profits , saving , etc . , though perhaps with different names . his analysis , and the austrian economists ' responses , fueled discussion of the economic calculation problem and market socialism in the 1930s . his method also anticipated abram bergson 's seminal formulation of a social welfare function three decades later .

== early life ==
james maitland was born on 29 march 1848 , his father was sir alexander ramsay-gibson-maitland of clifton hall , and his mother was thomasina maitland ( née hunt ) , and two brothers william and keith . sir anthony was a descendant of the earl of lauderdale ; however , it was through his father 's marriage to susan ramsay that he inherited the ramsay title and lands , as all other male descendants were deceased . sir anthony became the 3rd baronet of barnton , sauchie and bannockburn.james was educated at st andrews university before leaving to attend the royal military college at sandhurst ; however , after joining the army and becoming a captain in the highland borderers , he left after one year . he married fanny white , daughter of sir thomas woollaston white , 2nd baronet of tuxford and wallingwells in 1869 , near nottingham , and they moved to craigend in 1873 . james and fanny had two daughters .


== howietoun fishery ==
howietoun fishery was established in 1873 , maitland had previously been experimenting in another site ; however , the site was prone to flooding which meant that maitland and a team of men had to try and recapture the escaped swiss trout . howietoun was an ideal spot as it had a water supply from lake coulter and a steady supply of spring water also.maitland believed that fish could be raised in a similar way as farm animals , in that animal husbandry could also be successful when applied to a fishery . maitland 's approach to experimentation was a scientific one ; he would only change one variable during an experiment and then would hypothesise how the outcome had happened . this meant that he was able to work out that breeding young stock of fish gave a result of weak offspring ; instead , he realised older stock must be used to gain strong offspring . he worked out that the female fish must be stripped of their eggs and male milt collected in october ; he then worked on hatching boxes for the live ova . after the fry hatched , then they were transferred to rearing boxes before being transferred to plank ponds . maitland was meticulous in writing up his experiments ; this means that every change that he made in the diet , transport and selective breeding of the fish was documented . there are even pictures with measurements of the instruments maitland was inventing to make rearing fish easier.maitland also experimented on the diet of the trout and salmon at the fishery ; he worked out that horse spleen when ingested by trout caused blindness and nutritional cataracts . he worked on several options before concluding that the best option for feeding trout and salmon was horsemeat , shellfish and eggs.one of his most important experiments was finding ways to transport large quantities of live ova , at the time live ova were sent in crammed packages and when they arrived most did not survive , maitland took three attempts to work out how to insulate the cargo to stop fluctuations in temperature . successful shipments were then sent to wellington , dunedin and otago in the specially designed shipment boxes that maitland had designed himself .


=== awards ===
the work of maitland at howietoun fishery meant that he was awarded several diplomas in fish culture and two gold medals in 1883 and 1885 , at the international fisheries exhibitions , edinburgh .


== death and legacy ==
maitland died on 9 november 1897 , his daughter mary steel-maitland and her husband arthur steel-maitland took over the running of howietoun . howietoun fishery was then amalgamated into the northern fisheries company in 1914 before the maitland family sold it in 1969 . it became a part of the university of stirling aquaculture institute in 1979.the majority of brown trout re-stocking in scotland is achieved through the stock of howietoun fishery .

== biography ==
smith was born in ayrshire , scotland . he is known for his contributions to the field of botany . not to be confused with james edward smith , smith was regularly consulted by famed botanical illustrator william hooker about different species of plants . smith would gather rare plants from many places to create what was said to be one of the prettiest gardens in scotland at the time . he loved his plants so much that he could n't bear to destroy any of them and it is said that once when he was compelled to chop down a tree which had grown so large that its shadow threatened other plants , he shut his eyes and hacked at the tree until it fell .


== death ==

smith died on 1 january 1848 , aged 84 . his tombstone in ayr auld kirkyard described him as `` the father of scottish botany `` . by the end of the century both the house and garden at monkwood grove had gone but it remained a favorite place for sunday afternoon walks and occasionally we were rewarded with a sight of one of smith 's rare flowers surviving among the tangle of brambles and wild plants . monkwood grove was so remote that a little house which stood on the dalrymple bank of the river was known as fin ' me oot . although fin ' me oot cottage has gone too , the two fields on monkwood mains land beside the river are known as the fin ' me oot holms .
smith 's daughter margaret married well known botanist and author john goldie , making him goldie 's father in-law .

howard latimer penman ( 1909-1984 ) was a british meteorologist . he formulated penman ’ s formula which is used worldwide by meteorologists and agricultural scientists to assess evaporation rates in different setups ( lakes and ponds , lawns , cropped fields ) and locations in the world . with john monteith he formulated the penman–monteith equation which is used to calculate evapotranspiration and the need for crop irrigation . penman was a distinguished rothamsted research scientist and government advisor , and a well-known local figure in harpenden .


== early life ==
howard penman was born in county durham and studied at durham university where he graduated in physics in 1930 . while working for the british cotton research association in manchester he worked on his thesis for his ph.d. , which was awarded by durham university in 1938 . bored by the work on cotton dyes he applied in 1937 for a post in the soil physics department at rothamsted research , headed by bernard keen , for a salary of £320 per annum . he became interested in the records of the drain gauges , and their relationship with rainfall , and from these was able to estimate the rate at which water evaporated from bare soil . from these beginnings some of his major contributions would follow . when war broke out he was recruited by the admiralty and worked on the sound output of ships and submarines in connection with the development of acoustic mines . in 1944 he was recalled to rothamsted to work on the physics of wet soil in preparation for the land campaign , where the progress of military vehicles would be vital .


== career ==
after the war he continued work on water-related topics , including irrigation needs worldwide , and seasonal water balances for each catchment area in britain . r.k. schofield succeeded bernard keen in 1947 , but in 1954 schofield became head of the chemistry department and penman was appointed head of the separate physics department . several members of his staff were involved in meteorological projects in africa , and scientists came to be trained before taking posts in nigeria , kenya and uganda and elsewhere , working on the needs of tropical crops . in 1961 he served as president of the royal meteorological society , and he was elected fellow of the royal society in 1965 . he served on many academic and government bodies , and travelled widely , advising on reservoir projects and water needs , and was awarded the o.b.e . he retired from rothamsted in 1974 , but continued to take an interest in scientific and international issues until his death in 1984 .


== writings ==
besides his work penman also used to write humorous and satirical sketches . as a person he had a keen intellect and questioning temperament , but a fine sense of humour which showed itself in many ways , such as at the christmas pantomimes at rothamsted where he wrote some of the satirical sketches .


== contribution ==
with his wife nan he was very much involved with the united nations association and the need for international cooperation to solve the long term problems of peace and development . john monteith in his royal society obituary article wrote : “ by showing how classical physics can be used to solve environmental problems , howard penman made a unique contribution to agricultural meteorology and hydrology . his finest memorial is the formula which bears his name . ”

thomas g. barnes ( august 14 , 1911 – october 23 , 2001 ) was an american creationist , who argued in support of his religious belief in a young earth by making the faulty scientific claims that the earth 's magnetic field was consistently decaying and that einstein 's theory of relativity was incorrect .


== biography ==
barnes obtained three degrees in physics : an ab from hardin-simmons university in 1933 , an ms from brown university under robert bruce lindsay in 1936 , and an honorary sc.d . again from hardin-simmons university in 1950 . his detractors have questioned his credentials based on the fact that his doctorate was honorary.at the time that barnes joined the creation research society ( crs ) in the early 1960s , he was the head of the schellenger research laboratories at texas western college ( now university of texas at el paso ) , where he was completing a textbook on electricity and magnetism , and on whose faculty he served from 1938 until he retired in 1981 . barnes headed one of the first projects of the crs , to create a creationist high school biology text . barnes served as the president of the crs in the mid-1970s .


=== earth 's magnetic field decay ===
barnes claimed to calculate the half-life of the earth 's magnetic field as approximately 1,400 years based on 130 years of empirical data . some creationists have used barnes ' argument as evidence for a young earth , less than 10,000 years as suggested by the bible . his critics discredit this concept , claiming that barnes failed to take experimental uncertainties into account and used an obsolete model of the interior of the earth .

= jakob philipp kulik =
jakob philipp kulik ( 1793–1863 ) was an austrian mathematician known for his construction of a massive factor tables .


== biography ==
kulik was born in lemberg , which was part of the austrian empire , and is now lviv located in ukraine .


== kulik 's factor tables ==
in 1825 , kulik mentioned a table of factors up to 30 million , but this table does no longer seem to exist . it is also not clear if it had really been completed .
from about 1825 until 1863 kulik produced a factor table of numbers up to 100330200 ( except for numbers divisible by 2 , 3 , or 5 ) . this table basically had the same format than the table to 30 million and it is therefore most likely that the work on the `` magnus canon divisorum `` spanned from the mid-1820s to kulik 's death , at which time the tables were still unfinished . these tables fill eight volumes totaling 4212 pages , and are kept in the archives of the academy of sciences in vienna . volume ii of the 8-volume set has been lost .

born in 1883 , in reval , tsarist russia ( in an area later to become the nation of estonia ) , william morris leiserson came to the united states at the age of seven with his mother and two brothers . as a student at the university of wisconsin , he studied under professor john r. commons , whose life and work inspired leiserson to pursue the fields of economics and labor relations . after graduation , he continued at columbia university where he earned his ph.d. under henry rogers seager in 1911 .
leiserson then began a distinguished career as a research scholar , professor and public administrator that was marked by four decades of high level service in an era of profound economic , political and cultural change . shortly after receiving his ph.d. he returned to wisconsin where he originated the state employment service . returning to academia , he held professorships at the university of toledo and antioch college . his u.s. government service included chief of the labor administration division of the united states department of labor , secretary of the national labor board of the national recovery administration ( nra ) and member of the national labor relations board ( nlrb ) . the nlrb was the administrative arm of the wagner act , seminal legislation that guaranteed the right of workers to bargain collectively .
leiserson 's favorite government position was chairman of the national mediation board . this organization became the u.s. government 's administrative arm for implementing the railway labor act , which leiserson was instrumental in writing for the u.s. congress . the act later was amended to include the airline industry . this , also seminal , legislation provided thorough , and effective procedures ( carefully not requiring lawyers ) for solving labor-management disputes among transportation workers and industries providing essential services to the u.s. economy . to this day the legislation provides a prototype for resolving disputes that involve essential services .
most of the foregoing positions were appointments by president franklin d. roosevelt , during the great depression of the 1930s and world war ii . after leaving government service , he retired and returned to research and teaching at johns hopkins university . leiserson died in 1957 at the age of 74.while he devoted much scholarly and research effort to increasing the government 's awareness of the status and needs of the wage earner , leiserson understood well the role of the mediator and the art of balancing the interests of labor and management in industrial disputes . leiserson was awarded the honorary degree of doctor of laws by oberlin college , june 24 , 1947 .

= samuel kinsey =
samuel kinsey ( 25 may 1832 – 8 june 1883 ) was a christian minister and leader of the reactionary wing of the german baptist brethren that became the old german baptist brethren .


== early life ==
samuel kinsey was born in covington , ohio on 25 may 1832 to joel kinsey and elizabeth brumbaugh . on 23 april 1852 , he married barbara nead , daughter of peter nead , and together they had thirteen children . he joined the brethren as a member in 1853 . kinsey was economically successful , and was at various times a carpenter , a farmer , proprietor of a general store , owner of a tree nursery , and publisher . the place where he lived became known as the town of kinsey station . he was a deacon and was elected in 1870 as a recognized minister of lower stillwater brethren congregation in randolph township near dayton , ohio .


== old order leadership ==
between 1851 and 1865 , brethren periodicals began to be published under progressive editors henry kurtz , james quinter , and henry holsinger . at the same time , kinsey 's father-in-law , peter nead , was the primary leader for the reactionary wing of the brethren , known as old order brethren . out of this group emerged a new periodical , the vindicator , with kinsey as editor . it was first published on 1 march 1870 as an eight-page monthly , composed of scriptural interpretations , exhortations to piety , and news on church affairs . one of its goals was to counter the influence of progressive brethren periodicals.a major controversy among the brethren arose over the authority of tradition and the role of the church in establishing a church order or ordnung , known as the `` order of the brethren `` . in the vindicator , kinsey rejected that the church had any authority to change or adapt the order . this view sharply contrasted with other brethren at the time . the group that became the church of the brethren revered tradition and supported the role of the church in discerning an ordnung , but held this order to be changeable . meanwhile , the faction that became the brethren church rejected the need for a unified church order or agreement on practices not explicitly defined in christian scripture and sought to eliminate some brethren traditions which they felt lacked support from the scriptures.in around 1874 , kinsey handed over control of his business interests to others in order to devote himself to the service of the church . he was a hymn writer . in 1878 , kinsey was one of four men appointed and financially supported by the southern ohio district of the brethren to engage in missionary work in kentucky . this work was largely unsuccessful.a significant part of kinsey 's ministry was also his ongoing publishing . the vindicator was expanded to 32 pages per issue . his work was not well received ; kinsey was reprimanded by the 1881 brethren annual conference for encouraging dissension and criticizing church authorities . the old german baptist brethren split at this conference , with nead and kinsey as their primary leaders . the proliferation of unauthorized and uncontrolled periodicals has been claimed as a major cause of the division . in 1882 , at their first meeting , the old german baptist brethren recognized the vindicator as their official publication . kinsey was also ordained as an elder in 1882 .


== death and legacy ==
kinsey died on 8 june 1883 . he was succeeded as editor by joseph i . cover . the vindicator set a precedent of conservative periodicals that was followed by mennonite george r. brunk 's sword and trumpet . kinsey has continued to be influential in the old german baptist brethren . the vindicator continues to be published for the old german baptist brethren as of 2008 .

= john henry poynting =
john henry poynting frs ( 9 september 1852 – 30 march 1914 ) was an english physicist . he was a professor of physics at mason science college , from 1880 to 1900 , and then the successor institution , the university of birmingham until his death .


== biography ==
poynting was the youngest son of thomas elford poynting , a unitarian minister . he was born at the parsonage of the monton unitarian chapel in eccles , lancashire ( his father serving as minister there from 1846 to 1878 . ) in his boyhood he was educated at the nearby school operated by his father . from 1867 to 1872 he attended owens college , now the university of manchester , where his physics teachers included osborne reynolds and balfour stewart . from 1872 to 1876 he was a student at cambridge university , where he attained high honours in mathematics after taking grinds with edward routh . in the late 1870s he worked in the cavendish laboratory at cambridge under james clerk maxwell.he was the developer and eponym of the poynting vector , which describes the direction and magnitude of electromagnetic energy flow and is used in the poynting theorem , a statement about energy conservation for electric and magnetic fields . this work was first published in 1884 . he performed a measurement of newton 's gravitational constant by innovative means during 1893 . in 1903 he was the first to realise that the sun 's radiation can draw in small particles towards it : this was later named the poynting–robertson effect .
he discovered the torsion-extension coupling in finite strain elasticity . this is now known as the ( positive ) poynting effect in torsion .
poynting and the nobel prizewinner j. j. thomson co-authored a multi-volume undergraduate physics textbook , which was in print for about 50 years and was in widespread use during the first third of the 20th century . poynting wrote most of it.he was awarded an honorary msc in pure science in 1901 by birmingham university.poynting lived at 11 st augustine 's road , edgbaston with his family and servants for some years . he previously lived at 66 beaufort road , edgbaston ( demolished ) and died of a diabetic coma , aged 61 , at 10 ampton road , edgbaston in 1914 . in 1880 he married maria adney cropper . upon his death he was survived by his widow , a son , and two daughters .


== legacy ==
poynting 's most famous student may have been alfred j. lotka , who was inspired by poynting to apply the ideas of physical chemistry to biology . lotka dedicated his classic book on mathematical population biology to poynting .

craters on mars and the moon are named in his honour , as is the main physics building at the university of birmingham and the departmental society there , the poynting physical society .
he is credited with coining the expression `` greenhouse effect `` in 1909 to explain how infrared-absorbing trace gasses such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the surface temperature of earth and mars .

alexander catlin twining ( july 5 , 1801 – november 22 , 1884 ) was an american scientist and inventor .
twining , the son of stephen twining and almira ( catlin ) twining , was born in new haven , conn. , july 5 , 1801 . he graduated from yale college in 1820 . he left college with the intention of entering the ministry , and soon after studied for one year in andover theological seminary . in 1823 he returned to new haven as tutor in at yale , in which office he served for two years .
meanwhile he had decided to become a civil engineer , and now went to west point to prepare himself for his profession . he was first employed upon the state works of pennsylvania , and his earliest independent work was in 1835–37 as chief of the survey for the hartford and new haven railroad ; he was subsequently employed either as chief or consulting engineer upon every railroad running out of new haven ( excepting possibly the derby road ) . in like manner he was employed on the northern lines running up the connecticut river valley and through vermont , on the lake shore road between buffalo and erie , and on other roads in ohio , illinois , and michigan .
from 1839 to 1848 he filled the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy in middlebury college , vt. ; this position he resigned to give himself more fully to his engineering labors . he removed from middlebury to new haven in 1852 , and resided there for the rest of his life . from 1856 until his death he was a deacon in the first church , in which his father had filled the same office . for several years after his return to new haven his labor was mainly given to the development of his invention for the artificial production of ice economically on a large scale . the principle of his invention was widely adopted , but he failed to secure pecuniary recompense for it . he made valuable original investigations in astronomy , mathematics and physics , and was equally interested in questions of theology and political science , both in their theoretical and practical aspects in connection with the remarkable meteor shower of november 1833 , he deserves the credit for first suggesting the correct theory of radiation of meteor tracks from a fixed point among the stars .
early in october 1884 , he was attacked with congestion of the brain , and died at his home in new haven on november 22 , at the age of 83 .
on march 2 , 1829 , twining married harriet amelia kinsley , of west point , n. y. , who died october 12 , 1871 . their children were three sons ( graduates of yale ) and four daughters , including the rev . kingsley twining ; they survived their parents , with the exception of one son who died in the american civil war .

otto stolz ( 3 july 1842 – 23 november 1905 ) was an austrian mathematician noted for his work on mathematical analysis and infinitesimals . born in hall in tirol , he studied in innsbruck from 1860 and in vienna from 1863 , receiving his habilitation there in 1867 . two years later he studied in berlin under karl weierstrass , ernst kummer and leopold kronecker , and in 1871 heard lectures in göttingen by alfred clebsch and felix klein ( with whom he would later correspond ) , before returning to innsbruck permanently as a professor of mathematics .
his work began with geometry ( on which he wrote his thesis ) but after the influence of weierstrass it shifted to real analysis , and many small useful theorems are credited to him . for example , he proved that a continuous function f on a closed interval [ a , b ] with midpoint convexity , i.e . ,

, has left and right derivatives at each point in ( a , b ) .he died in 1905 shortly after finishing work on einleitung in die funktionentheorie . his name lives on in the stolz-cesàro theorem .


== work on non-archimedean systems ==
stolz published a number of papers containing constructions of non-archimedean extensions of the real numbers , as detailed by ehrlich ( 2006 ) . his work , as well as that of paul du bois-reymond , was sharply criticized by georg cantor as an `` abomination `` . cantor published a `` proof-sketch `` of the inconsistency of infinitesimals . the errors in cantor 's proof are analyzed by ehrlich ( 2006 ) .

wilhelm carl johann conrad koch , commonly known as konrad koch ( 13 february 1846 – 13 april 1911 ) was a german teacher and football pioneer .


== early life and career ==
koch was born on 13 february 1846 in braunschweig , duchy of brunswick . after finishing secondary school in braunschweig , he studied theology and philology at the universities of göttingen , berlin , and leipzig.he returned to braunschweig in 1868 to become a teacher for ancient greek , latin , history , and geography at the prestigious martino-katharineum secondary school .


== football ==

koch was a pioneer in introducing ball games as part of physical education in german schools . he was influenced by the ideas of thomas arnold respectively thomas hughes ' novel tom brown 's school days . in 1874 koch and his colleague august hermann organized what is believed to be the first-ever football match in germany , between pupils from their school martino-katharineum . however , according to other sources , earlier games of football might have taken place in other german cities , possibly between members of the dresden english football club.in 1875 , koch published the first german version of the rules of football , although koch 's version of the game still closely resembled rugby football . the new game was quickly adopted by other schools in braunschweig and spread to other cities during the late 1870s , including hanover , bremen , hamburg , and göttingen.in 1876 , a newspaper in hamburg wrote that koch had learned about football during a trip to england . this is likely false , as there are no sources that indicate that he had visited england before 1895 . koch did speak english , however , as he had been taught from a young age by his father , an english teacher .

franz xaver hauser ( 12 january 1794 in krasowitz , today krasovice , part of kondrac , ( benešov district ) , czech republic – 14 august 1870 in freiburg im breisgau ) was a singer , voice teacher , and music manuscript collector .
at his father 's insistence , he first studied medicine , but he then studied singing with johann wenzel tomaschek and composition with oboist josef triebensee .
he made his stage debut in 1817 in prague as sarastro in mozart 's magic flute . he found great success at the opera theaters in vienna , leipzig , and berlin . he retired from the stage in 1838 and taught singing in vienna . in 1846 he was appointed as director of the newly established conservatory in munich ( now the hochschule für musik und theater münchen ) , serving as its director until 1864 . he retired in 1865 to karlsruhe and two years later to freiburg im breisgau .
contemporary critics considered hauser cold as an actor but approved of his pure voice . he was known for his interpretation of weber and as figaro ( both rossini 's and mozart 's ) , bertram , william tell , and spohr 's faust .
hauser had many students including jenny lind and henriette sontag . he wrote a popular singing manual , gesanglehre für lehrer und lernende ( leipzig , 1866 ) ( freely available through google books ) . as a composer , he was known for his songs . his correspondence with composer moritz hauptmann was published in two volumes in 1871 .
hauser 's greatest significance today is as a collector of musical manuscripts –most notably of the composer johann sebastian bach- assembling the greatest 19th century collection of that composer 's manuscripts . he was a consultant for the bach-gesellschaft edition and prepared a thematic catalogue of bach 's works . most of hauser 's bach manuscripts ( including 19 cantatas , the accompanied sonatas for violin , and the english suites for keyboard ) were acquired by the berlin royal library in 1904 . others were destroyed in 1945 . parts of his collection are also in the darmstadt landesbibliothek and the harvard university loeb music library .
his son , moritz hauser ( 1827–1857 ) , became a theater director in königsberg and a minor composer .

= giovanni battista brocchi =
giovanni battista ( or giambattista ) brocchi ( 18 february 1772 – 25 september 1826 ) was an italian naturalist , mineralogist and geologist .


== biography ==
he was born in bassano del grappa , italy , and studied jurisprudence at the university of padova , but his attention was turned to mineralogy and botany . in 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in the new lyceum of brescia ; but he more especially devoted himself to geological researches in the adjacent districts . the fruits of these labors appeared in different publications , particularly in his trattato mineralogico e chimico sulle miniere di ferro del dipartimento del mella ( 1808 ) a treatise on the iron mines of the mella traditional region . these researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in the recently established kingdom of italy , and enabled him to extend his investigations over a great part of the country.in 1811 brocchi produced a valuable essay entitled memoria mineralogica sulla valle di fassa in tirolo ; but his most important work is the conchiologia fossile subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli apennini , e sul suolo adiacente ( 2 vols . , milan , 1814 ) , containing accurate details of the structure of the apennine range , and an account of the fossils of the italian tertiary strata compared with existing species . these subjects were further illustrated by his geognostic map , and his catalogo ragionato di una raccolta di rocce , disposto con ordine geografico , per servire alla geognosia dell ' italia ( milan , 1817 ) . his work dello stato fisico del suolo di rome ( 1820 ) , with its accompanying map , is likewise noteworthy . in it he corrected the erroneous views of scipione breislak , who conceived that rome occupies the site of a volcano , to which he ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills . brocchi pointed out that these materials were derived either from monte albano , an extinct volcano , twelve miles from the city , or from the monti cimini , still farther to the
north.in 1814 brocchi presented the thesis that species , like individuals , age and eventually die out , - an idea that later influenced charles darwin.several papers by him , on mineralogical subjects , appeared in the biblioteca italiana from 1816 to 1823 . in the latter year , brocchi sailed for egypt , in order to explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources . every facility was granted by mehemet ali , who in 1825 appointed him one of a commission to examine the territory of the recently conquered kingdom of sennar ; but brocchi , unfortunately for science , fell a victim to the climate , and died at khartoum.much of his writings and collections are now housed in the museo civico di bassano .

= erik benzelius the elder =
erik benzelius ( the elder ) ( 16 december 1632 – 17 february 1709 ) was a swedish theologian and archbishop of uppsala .
benzelius was born at the bentseby farm in the parish of luleå in northern sweden , son of the farmer and lay assessor ( nämndeman ) henrik jakobsson . he took a family name derived from his birthplace , rather than using the patronymic as was common in the swedish peasantry . he was raised by a relative who was a merchant in uppsala , and studied at uppsala university , where he completed his filosofie magister degree in 1661 .
he was hired by magnus gabriel de la gardie as a tutor for his sons in 1660 and accompanied one of them on a foreign journey stretching from 1663 to 1665 , visiting copenhagen , the most important universities of germany , and continuing to paris , london , oxford , and leiden .
returning to uppsala , he was appointed professor extraordinary of history and moral philosophy in 1665 , of theology in 1666 , and 1670 ordinary professor of theology . he became bishop of strängnäs in 1687 , and succeeded olov svebilius in 1700 as archbishop of uppsala .
he took an important part in the various ecclesiastical committees active during the reigns of charles xi and charles xii , such as that concerning the new church law of 1686 , the new hymn book of 1695 and the new bible translation . in the bible translation committee , created on the initiative of jesper swedberg , benzelius was a conservative force , and is largely responsible for the fact that the so-called charles xii 's bible ended up as nothing more than a revision of the swedish reformation bible .
benzelius was a typical representative of 17th-century swedish lutheran orthodoxy , was careful not to deviate from established theological principles , and lacked originality in his writing . nevertheless , he was a productive author of works in theology , and his work on church history was used as a textbook for the following century .
of the seven sons of benzelius , three later were appointed archbishops of uppsala , one after the other : erik ( 1675-1743 , appointed 1742 , but died before taking office ) , jakob ( 1683-1747 , archbishop from 1744 ) , and henrik ( 1689-1758 , archbishop from 1747 ) .

jakob kolletschka ( 4 july 1803 , biela ( now luže ) , bohemia – 13 march 1847 , vienna ) was professor of forensic medicine at vienna general hospital in austria .
jakob kolletschka is mostly known for his death which eventually led ignaz semmelweis to his discovery of the etiology of childbed fever . below is a quote from the original reference describing the details of his death .
in a lecture in 1846 he is reputed to have said , `` it is here no uncommon thing for midwives , especially in the commencement of their practice , to pull off legs and arms of infants , and even to pull away the entire body
and leave the head in the uterus . such occurrences are not altogether uncommon ; they often happen . ``


== death ==
semmelweis had left for venice on 2 march 1847 to escape the many deaths at the viennese maternity institution , which haunted him . he returned to vienna on 20 march 1847 .

i was immediately overwhelmed by the sad news that professor [ jakob ] kolletschka , whom i greatly admired , had died in the interim .
the case history went as follows : kolletschka , professor of forensic medicine , often conducted autopsies for legal purposes in the company of students . during one such exercise , his finger was pricked by a student with the same knife that was being used in the autopsy . i do not recall which finger was cut . professor kolletschka contracted lymphangitis and phlebitis [ inflammation of the lymphatic vessels and of the veins respectively ] in the upper extremity . then [ ... ] he died of bilateral pleurisy , pericarditis , peritonitis , and meningitis [ inflammation of the membranes of the lungs and thoracic cavity , of the fibroserous sac surrounding the heart , of the membranes of the abdomen and pelvic cavity , and of the membranes surrounding the brain , respectively ] . a few days before he died , a metastasis also formed in one eye . i was still animated by the art treasures of venice , but the news of kolletschka 's death agitated me still more . in this excited condition i could see clearly that the disease from which kolletschka died was identical to that from which so many hundred maternity patients had also died . the maternity patients also had lymphangitis , peritonitis , pericarditis , pleurisy , and meningitis , and metastases also formed in many of them . day and night i was haunted by the image of kolletschka 's disease and was forced to recognize , ever more decisively , that the disease from which kolletschka died was identical to that from which so many maternity patients died .

= paolo straneo =
paolo pietro straneo ( 19 june 1874 , genoa – 24 november 1968 , genoa ) was an italian mathematical physicist .


== biography ==
straneo studied at eth zurich , where he met and was a friend of einstein . in 1897 he received his ph.d. in natural philosophy of the university of zurich . from 1899 he was a libero docente ( privatdocent ) in mathematical physics and for some years he was a docente incaricato ( lecturer without tenure ) in mathematical physics at the university of turin . after a period of working as a libero professionista ( an engineering consultant or a freelancer performing work similar to that of a libero docente ) , in 1924 he again became a libero docente and was put in charge of mathematical physics at the university of genoa . there , from 1925 he was a professor ordinarius in mathematical physics and also taught theoretical physics .
he did research on mathematical physics , in particular , the theory of relativity.he contributed to the enciclopedia hoepli delle matematiche elementari the articles : teoria generale delle dimensioni fisiche ( general theory of physical dimensions ) and materia , irraggiamento e fisica quantistica ( matter , radiation and quantum physics ) .
straneo was an invited speaker at the international congress of mathematicians in 1928 in bologna and in 1932 in zürich . he was elected a member of the accademia nazionale dei lincei .

the atti dei lincei contains in recent numbers two somewhat closely allied papers on thermo-electricity . the first of these is a verification of the principle of thermodynamic equivalence for bimetallic conductors , by signor paolo straneo , who concludes not only that thermo-electric phenomena proceed regularly in perfect accord with theory , but they can be studied with sufficient exactness by temperature observations without recourse to calorimetry . the determination of the peltier-effect coefficient by the author 's method succeeds even in the case in which previous methods are wanting in accuracy , namely , when the two metals possess a high specific resistance and a feeble peltier-effect . with the present method , the joule effect only slightly affects the phenomenon under consideration .
signor straneo 's method forms the basis of a paper by signor a. pochettino on variations of the peltier-effect in a magnetic field . the value of the peltier-effect was observed to vary with the magnetisation .

alice evelyn wilson , mbe , frsc , frcgs ( august 26 , 1881 – april 15 , 1964 ) was canada 's first female geologist . her scientific studies of the rocks and fossils of the ottawa region between 1913 and 1963 remain a respected source of knowledge .


== life and career ==
wilson grew up in cobourg , ontario . the canoeing and camping trips with her father and brothers sparked her interest in fossils . her family also encouraged scholarly thought and the pursuit of scientific knowledge . in 1901 wilson began studying modern language and history at the victoria college in toronto . she did not finish her last year of studies due to ill health . but she was hired by the mineralogy division of the university of toronto museum , thus beginning her career in geology . she later completed her degree and , in 1907 , was hired into a permanent position as a museum technician at the geological survey of canada ( gsc ) , which was headquartered at the victoria memorial museum in ottawa .
wilson persisted through seven years of being denied time off to pursue a higher degree in geology . eventually , the canadian federation of university women awarded her a scholarship so that she could embark on graduate studies at the university of chicago . she graduated in 1929 with a doctorate in geology .
at the gsc , wilson could not participate in fieldwork that required living in camps with men in remote regions . instead , wilson created her own niche and did fieldwork at local sites in the ottawa area . for the next fifty years she studied this area on foot , by bicycle and eventually by car . the gsc published the results of her fieldwork in 1946 and her geology of the st. lawrence lowland , ontario and quebec was the first major geological publication about the area . in addition to a comprehensive discussion of its geology , wilson covered the area 's economic resources , including building stone , sand , gravel and drinking water .
from 1948 until 1958 wilson was a lecturer in paleontology at carleton college ( later carleton university ) . carleton recognized wilson both as a geologist and as an inspiring teacher with an honorary degree in 1960 . wilson also worked to bring geology to a broader public . she wrote a children 's book , the earth beneath our feet , aimed at encouraging broader knowledge and interest in the science she was so passionate about.wilson became a respected member of the gsc and mentor to many young geologists . she retired at the age of 65 , as was required by law . however , she kept her office at the gsc and continued her work until her death in 1964 .


== awards and professional recognition ==
wilson was the first woman geologist hired by the geological survey of canada ( 1909 ) , one of the first two women elected as fellows of the royal canadian geographical society ( 1930 ) ; the first canadian woman to be admitted to the geological society of america ( 1936 ) and the first female fellow of the royal society of canada ( 1938 ) .
in 1935 , when the government of r.b . bennett was looking to honour a woman in the federal civil service , wilson was chosen to become a member of the order of the british empire .
in 1991 the royal society of canada established the alice wilson awards for emerging women scholars . wilson was inducted into the canadian science and engineering hall of fame in 2005 .

fortunato of brescia ( 1701–1754 ) was an italian minorite of the reform of lombardy and anatomist .


== life ==
he was born at brescia , and received the religious habit in 1718 . a philosopher and theologian , fortunato was also renowned for his studies in the natural sciences . he was secretary general of his order , and stood in high favour at the bourbon court of spain . he died in madrid .


== works ==
he was among the first to bring together the teachings of scholastic philosophy and the discoveries of the physical sciences . his scientific work is rendered important by his extensive use of the microscope , in which he followed the lead of malpighi . avoiding the then prevalent discussions on vitalism , he devoted himself to a positive study of the problems of natural science .
convinced that a knowledge of microscopic anatomy is the key to the secrets of nature , he deemed two things to be of prime importance :

an experimental study of the histological constitution of the various organs , to learn their functions ; and
the separation of these organs into their elements , to determine their embryological origin.this view , clear in the works of fortunato , has prevailed in pathology and physiology . and in this sense fortunato was a pioneer . he confined himself to the microscopic study of the parts of the organism , and in this way succeeded in classifying tissues and organs many years before bichat ( 1800 ) . fortunato was the first to distinguish between tissues and organs .
he established the idea of tissues , or , as he wrote , `` of those organic parts which possess a definite structure visible with the microscope and characterized by their component elements `` . with sufficient accuracy he described connective and bony tissue . the morphological complexus of the various tissues he calls the `` system of tissues `` ; and the physiological complexus of the various organs he calls the `` system of organs `` .
from his many accurate descriptions , it is evident that his researches extended to many animals , and particularly to insects . he innovated in comparative anatomy , with ideas not found in malpighi , morgagni , leeuwenhoek , or haller , the path-finders in microscopic anatomy .

= sverre petterssen =
sverre petterssen ( 19 february 1898 – 31 december 1974 ) was a norwegian meteorologist , prominent in the field of weather analysis and forecasting .


== early life ==
born in norway into a humble family , he paid for his higher education by working at the telegraph office , and a nursery provided by the armed forces that he joined as a recruit . he studied in bergen where he met tor bergeron during a lecture , and was so impressed by his analysis of a 1922 storm that he joined the bergen school of meteorology in 1923 .
in the late 1920s he worked at the geophysical institute in tromsø , northern norway .


== career ==
after school , he remained a weather officer in the norwegian air force until 1939 . he went to the us in 1935 , lecturing on norwegian meteorological theories to the us navy and caltech . in 1939 , he was hired by mit as head of the meteorology department , and wrote two important books there : weather analysis and forecasting ( 1940 ) and introduction to meteorology ( 1941 ) .
with the invasion of norway , petterssen returned to europe and offered his services in england to the met office , on loan from the norwegian air force . during world war ii , he served as a weather forecaster for bombing raids and special operations .
he is most remembered for his work in what has been called the most significant weather forecast in history , the d-day forecast , where he contributed significantly to the postponement of d-day by one day . three groups of meteorologists gave advice to general dwight eisenhower , and d-day was originally planned for 5 june 1944 . but he got big trouble with academically untrained competitors , especially from the united states , who believed that the weather was repeated – and had found a weather recurring pattern in the 20s that they felt was positive . and general dwight d. eisenhower was relying on his men .
`` pettersen , which was not always as diplomatic , made it clear that this was nonsense and quasi science but eisenhower was convinced , and the invasion would take place on 5 june . but at the morning meeting on 4 june pettersen presented a weather map showing a storm on 5 june . to strong protests from the american quasi-meteorologist , d-day was postponed.the german war fleet was laid in port : they thought it could not get any invasion because of the storm .
but the norwegian meteorologist knew his meteorology : his analysis showed a 36-hour gap between two storms the morning of 6 june – just enough to make the giant attack with more than 100,000 soldiers , planes , paratroopers and boats . `` the forecast provided by sverre petterssen caused eisenhower to decide at 0430 on 4 june to postpone d-day to 6 june . initially it was proposed to postpone the operation to 19 june .

on 19 june the worst storm to date in the century struck the english channel . if d-day had been launched on 5 june as originally planned , the allied casualties would probably have been much higher , and even higher if launched on 19 june .


== aftermath ==
in retrospect , americans claimed – including in movies – it was their meteorologists heroes who saved the situation , and only in 1974 , shortly before his death , sverre pettersen came with his version – documenting a violent quarrel .
the american meteorological historian james fleming also honored pettersen in a report 30 years later – in 2004 .


== awards ==
1965 awarded the prestigious international meteorological organization prize from the world meteorological organization .
1969 symons gold medal of the royal meteorological society

roger a. broucke ( march 25 , 1932 – june 21 , 2005 ) was an aerospace engineer known for his solutions to the three-body problem . after working on practical orbital mechanics at the jet propulsion laboratory , he became a professor at the university of texas at austin .


== life ==
broucke was born on a farm in furnes , belgium . he studied at the catholic university of leuven , earning bachelor 's and master 's degrees in mathematics in 1955 and 1957 respectively , under the mentorship of georges lemaître . after completing his military service he worked for the oil industry while earning a second master 's degree , in operations research , from the university of brussels in 1960.he returned to leuven for his doctoral work , on the three-body problem , which he completed in 1962 . at this time he moved to california to work at the jet propulsion laboratory ; while there , he also took adjunct positions at west coast university , the university of southern california , and the university of california , los angeles ( ucla ) . his position at ucla became a regular-rank associate professorship in 1969.in 1975 , broucke moved to the university of texas at austin as an associate professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics . at austin , he helped found the texas institute for computational mechanics in 1976 .


== contributions ==
in the three-body problem , broucke 's doctoral research involved pioneering use of computer simulations to classify stable and unstable orbits . he investigated what happens to this classification for earth–moon–satellite systems in the limit as the ratio of earth to moon mass approaches zero ; his conjecture about this limiting behavior , `` broucke 's principle `` , was finally proven correct in 1981 by lawrence perko . as part of this work , he also developed symbolic computation methods for handling poisson series.later , he studied the anisotropic kepler problem , a mathematical model of the motion of an electron trapped in a potential well . as he showed , this system is not purely chaotic : it has periodic orbits as well . he also studied the use of gravity assist in finding efficient flight plans for space probes .


== recognition ==
in 1973 , broucke became executive editor of the journal celestial mechanics.the american astronautical society gave him their dirk brouwer award in 2002 .

wilhelm mayer ( 10 june 1831 – 22 january 1898 ) was an austro-bohemian composer who published his works under the name w. a. rémy . he was also a noted teacher , whose pupils included ferruccio busoni and felix weingartner . his name sometimes appears as wilhelm mayer-rémy .


== career ==
wilhelm mayer ( some sources say his full name was benjamin wilhelm mayer ) was born in prague , the son of a lawyer . he studied at the prague organ school in 1846 . his overture to eugène sue 's drama jean cavalier was written when he was 17 , but his parents required him to enter the legal profession . he graduated as a doctor of law in 1856 , when he was 25 . he then occupied various posts in the austro-hungarian civil service.in 1862 he took up music once again , becoming conductor of the steiermärkischer musikverein in graz . during his eight-year stay in that post , he introduced a number of his own compositions , such as the overture sardanapalus , the symphonic poem helena , and a symphony in f major . these three works were also presented in leipzig.after resigning as conductor in 1870 , he devoted himself to composition and private teaching . he published his works under the name w. a. rémy , an anagram of `` w. mayer `` . it has also been noted that the initials w. a. of his pseudonym are the same as wolfgang amadeus mozart 's , mozart being his musical idol . mayer focussed on the music of mozart and johann sebastian bach , but greatly disliked johannes brahms and richard wagner . for him , the first four preludes and fugues from book i of bach 's the well-tempered clavier represented water , fire , earth and air respectively , and he conceived many others in a poetical light . he taught luigi cherubini 's methods for counterpoint , and used hector berlioz 's orchestral treatise.through his former pupil wilhelm kienzl 's intercession with ferruccio busoni 's father , busoni studied harmony , counterpoint , orchestration and composition with mayer from november 1879 to april 1881 , being just 15 when he completed his formal studies with honours . mayer taught busoni that `` the widest possible culture makes the artist `` , a motto busoni wrote on his 430-page treatise on composition he had written out in longhand during his studies with mayer and later transmitted to his own pupils . busoni wrote a `` fugue in f major on a theme of w. a. rémy `` ( bv 154 ) , and dedicated his praeludium ( basso ostinato ) und fuge ( doppelfuge zum choral ) op . 7 ( op . 76 ) , for organ ( bv 157 ) to his teacher .
mayer 's other notable students included felix weingartner , richard heuberger , emil von reznicek , richard sahla , marie baumayer josef gauby and friedrich von hausegger.as a teacher , mayer was exacting , but also inspiring . his reputation extended throughout europe . emperor franz josef i awarded him the knight 's cross of the order of franz joseph , the only private music teacher ever so honoured.mayer married and had a daughter , melanie . he died in graz in 1898 , aged 66 . his former student ferruccio busoni wrote a tribute to him in the allgemeine musikalische zeitung .

charles latif hyder ( april 18 , 1930 – june 8 , 2004 ) , known in the ussr as `` dr haider , `` was an american astrophysicist and dissident from albuquerque , new mexico .


== biography ==
hyder was born in albuquerque , new mexico in 1930 . after graduating from albuquerque high school , he served in the united states air force during the korean war.hyder attended the university of new mexico , graduating with bachelor 's ( 1958 ) and master 's ( 1960 ) degrees in physics . in 1964 , he received a doctorate in astrophysics from the university of colorado . through the 1970s and 1980s , he was involved in various scientific activities in the field of solar physics , publishing more than 50 works , and was also involved in nasa 's solar maximum mission satellite .
hyder was married twice and had four children .


== activism ==
hyder was most noted for his strong anti-nuclear stance , as well as for hunger strikes which he used to advocate his causes . he began a supposed 218-day hunger strike on september 23 , 1986 near the white house in washington , demanding that ronald reagan stop the arms race and eliminate the use of nuclear weapons.in the soviet union , hyder was a regular participant on the broadcast program vremya ( 'time ' ) . a commemorative medal was minted in his honor . mikhail gorbachev wrote a letter to him , and when the hunger strike ended , soviet punk rock band nol ( 'zero ' ) composed a satirical song entitled `` доктор хайдер `` ( `` dr. haider `` ) , with its refrain meaning `` dr. haider has started to eat again ! ``


== controversy ==
in the usa , hyder 's hunger strike did not attract much attention . furthermore , the astrophysicist was not always present at the white house . the russian gosteleradio ( government broadcasting ) correspondent in washington , vladimir dunaev , introduced and explained the scientist 's story to the russian audience . dunaev 's son later revealed that to make the hunger strike look continuous , dunaev would shoot five stories in succession every day , asking dr. hyder to change into different suits and ties .
according to dunaev , hyder was advised by doctors to diet , as his weight openly threatened his health . during the hunger strike he lost almost half of his weight of 300 pounds . it was later revealed that hyder drank fruit juice and took vitamins during the hunger strike . according to the most skeptical physicians , he fasted only in the daytime .
after the end of the hunger strike , hyder ran for president . he also subsequently accused the ussr of environmental pollution , after which russian news agencies stopped reporting about him in the ussr . in 1999 , he published the book `` human survival on a plutonium-contaminated planet , `` again trying to fast in order to fight against the storage of nuclear waste ( waste isolation pilot plant ) .

william henry dallinger frs ( 5 july 1839 – 7 november 1909 ) was a british minister in the wesleyan methodist church . he was also an accomplished scientist , being the first to study the complete lifecycle of unicellular organisms under the microscope and studying the adaptation of such organisms to temperature.he made numerous contributions to microscopy , and was president of the quekett microscopical club from 1889 to 1892 . dallinger was awarded three honorary doctorates , the ll.d . from victoria college , toronto in 1884 , the d.sc . from dublin in 1892 , and the d.l.c . from durham in 1896 .
dallinger was married to emma ion goldsmith ( 1842-1910 ) . they had one child , son percy gough ( 1867-1930 ) .


== research into darwin 's theories ==
dallinger was one of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment . in the late 19th century , he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years ( 1880–1886 ) . dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °f up to 158 °f . the early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °f , and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °f . the organisms dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment , on the other hand , were perfectly fine at 158 °f . however , these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °f . dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for darwinian adaptation in his incubator , and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment . unfortunately , dallinger 's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886 , and dallinger could not continue this line of research .
dallinger was an early supporter of darwinism . he accepted natural selection and considered creationism to be `` absolutely untenable `` . he believed there was no conflict between religion and science and there was no reason to try and reconcile the book of genesis with geology .

david randall-maciver fba ( 31 october 1873 – 30 april 1945 ) was a british-born archaeologist , who later became an american citizen . he is most famous for his excavations at great zimbabwe which provided the first solid evidence that the site was built by shona peoples .
randall-maciver was educated at the queens college , oxford . he graduated in 1896 with a first class degree . he began his professional archaeological career in 1898 working for flinders petrie in egypt , uncovering the mortuary temple of senwosret iii at abydos . in 1906 he was appointed as curator of the egyptian section at the penn museum , university of pennsylvania , taking charge of the collection following sara yorke stevenson 's resignation in 1905.with funding from eckley b. coxe jr. , randall-maciver initiated research into the relationship between egypt and nubia , uncovering some of the earliest evidence of ancient nubian culture , dating back to 3100bce . between 1905 and 1906 randall-maciver conducted the first detailed study of great zimbabwe . the absence of any artefacts of non-african origin led him to conclude that the structure was built by local people . earlier scholars had speculated that the structure had been built by arab or phoenician traders . between 1907 and 1910 he excavated the site of karanog , a former provincial capital of the kingdom of kush .
randall-maciver left penn museum in 1911 following a disagreement with new museum director george byron gordon , becoming librarian of the american geographical society . in 1914 he left the ags to work as a british intelligence officer in the first world war . in 1921 he moved to italy to study etruscan archaeology . he remained in italy during world war ii , assisting the allied forces monuments , fine arts , and archives program , the famous `` monuments men `` , to preserve historical monuments and cultural property.randall-maciver died in new york city on 30 april 1945 .

= galileo ferraris =
galileo ferraris ( 31 october 1847 – 7 february 1897 ) was an italian physicist and electrical engineer , one of the pioneers of ac power system and an inventor of the three-phase induction motor . many newspapers touted that his work on the induction motor and power transmission systems were some of the greatest inventions of all ages . he published an extensive and complete monograph on the experimental results obtained with open-circuit transformers of the type designed by the power engineers lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs .


== biography ==
born at livorno vercellese ( kingdom of sardinia ) , ferraris gained a master 's degree in engineering and became an assistant of technical physics near the regal italian industrial museum . ferraris independently researched the rotary magnetic field in 1885 . ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors . the research and his studies resulted in the development of an alternator , which may be thought of as an alternating-current motor operating in reverse , so as to convert mechanical ( rotating ) power into electric power ( as alternating current ) .
on 11 march 1888 , ferraris published his research in a paper to the royal academy of sciences in turin ( two months later nikola tesla gained u.s. patent 381,968 , application filed october 12 , 1887 . serial number 252,132 ) . these alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts , and depended on rotating magnetic field for their operation . the resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance . the invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification , as is the power transformer . these inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances . polyphase power enabled the use of water-power ( via hydroelectric generating plants in large dams ) in remote places , thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity , which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done . this versatility sparked the growth of power-transmission network grids on continents around the globe .
in 1889 , ferraris worked at the italian industrial institution , a school of electrical engineering ( the first school of this kind in italy , subsequently incorporated in the politecnico di torino ) . in 1896 , ferraris joined the italian electrotechnical association and became the first national president of the organization .
galileo ferraris did not confine his research interests to electricity . he also researched the fundamental properties of dioptric instruments and made elementary representation of the theory and its applications . his work contains a detailed description of the geometric dioptrics for uncentered systems . he provided a greater generality as previously found in the telescopic system treatments , with less emphasis on applications .
in the second main sections , the results obtained are applied to optical instruments . the magnification , field of view , and the brightness of the instrument were dealt with in great detail . the field denned as the author of the cone opening angle , the tip of the first main points of the lens , and its base formed by the parts of the object in view , will possess the same brightness . the eye is not treated .


== memorials ==
the city of turin honored the contributions that ferraris made to science . a general committee proposed an addition to the royal industrial museum of turin with a permanent monument commemorating his scientific and industrial achievements . additionally , an avenue was named in honor of ferraris .

= leonard dubkin =
leonard dubkin ( 1905-1972 ) was an american author and naturalist from chicago .
he is known for his books and newspaper columns on the subject of wildlife found in urban locations .


== early life ==
leonard dubkin was born in 1905 in odessa , ukraine ( then russia . ) he came to the united states with his parents in 1907 . the oldest of seven with a chronically ill father , his family relied on jewish charity organizations . in the eighth grade , leonard dropped out of school to work and take care of his family . by the age of 12 he was taking meticulous notes on the life histories of butterflies and moths . he took an interest in nature from an early age and frequently contributed to the children 's pages of the chicago tribune . the social worker jane addams took an interest in him and gave him his first typewriter . this paved his way to a career in journalism.in 1934 he married actress muriel schwartz and created a local talent directory for radio and stage actors . this successful business allowed him to write his novels , review books for the new york times , and correspond with other nature writers such as rachel carson and edwin way teale .
often featured in his books and columns is his daughter pauline yearwood , herself a successful journalist and the managing editor for the chicago jewish news .


== career ==
dubkin had difficulty committing to the topics assigned by editors in favor of observing nature . en route to cover a plane crash at midway airport , he stopped to observe a cricket singing in a field . by the time he got to the scene of the accident , all the survivors had been taken away . he missed another story by exploring a church tower where pigeons went to nest or die . on a pivotal case in which he was sent to interview a murder suspect , he became distracted by squirrels nesting in the walls of the suspect 's home . upon returning to the office without a scoop , he was fired .
in the following period of unemployment and occasional dispiriting office jobs , he took to observing nature closely instead of looking for work . among the creatures he observed in chicago were ballooning spiders , bats , crickets , polyphemus moths and cecropia moths.he eventually found work as an amateur naturalist , writing about his subject in a newspaper column with lerner newspapers and in his own books .
he authored six books , now out of print , about the natural history of chicago , arguing for the preservation of secret places , small parks , and urban wildlife . he wrote a column called `` the birds and bees `` in the lerner newspapers , published between 1950 and 1972 . during this time there was little to no nature writing taking place in chicago - conservation efforts focused on larger suburban spaces , such as forest preserves .
he became a champion of everyday wildlife and promoted the idea that wildlife worth observing was not necessarily exotic.a city park in chicago is named for him , dubkin park , where he often ate lunch while working for the lerner newspapers . the park has a community garden , many species of native and non-native plants , and a blank wall along the metra tracks . before she died in 2016 , his daughter planted a peony in his memory at the park . it is still there .

wilhelm august lampadius was born in hehlen ( braunschweig-wolfenbüttel ) on 8 august 1772 and died on 13 april 1842 in freiberg . he was a german pharmacist in göttingen from 1785 until 1791 . also he was an `` extraordinary professor `` of chemistry and mineralogy in 1794 and an `` ordinary professor `` in 1795 . he taught at the mining academy in freiberg .
lampadius is best known for inflaming the first coal gas lantern on european ground .


== life and work ==
lampadius completed in five years ( started in 1785 ) his qualifications and became a pharmacist by completing the exam . at the university of göttingen ( 1791–92 ) he was taught by johann friedrich gmelin and georg christoph lichtenberg .
after that he got to know martin heinrich klaproth and sigismund friedrich hermbstädt in berlin . at the same time joachim graf von sternberg offered lampadius to accompany him on a research travel to russia and china . their trip stopped in moscow because they did not get the permission to enter interior russia . so lampadius followed von sternberg to his possessions in bohemia . there he worked as a chemist for the ironworks in radwitz .


klaproth helped him to become a professors 's assistant at the mining academy in freiberg . he specialized himself for metallurgical chemistry . abraham gottlob werner recommended lampadius and he was named as a professor for metallurgy .
in 1811/12 lampadius illuminated his street in front of his house in freiberg with the first hard coal gas lantern in europe .


== chemistry ==
in 1796 he accidentally obtained carbon disulfide ( schwefelalcohol ) by destilling iron pyrites with moist charcoal . he concluded that sulphur and hydrogen are the source materials for the 'alcohol of sulphur ' . he is regarded as the discoverer for `` alcohol sulfuris `` .
he figured out that lead dissolves in acids more easily , if it is alloyed with tin . this realisation read him the harmfulness of many plates and pans .
he dealt also with researches about the fodder beet sugar .

== biography ==
in 1662 abraham a sancta clara joined the catholic religious order of discalced augustinians , and assumed the religious name by which he is known . in this order he rose step by step until he became prior provincialis and definitor of his province . having early gained a great reputation for pulpit eloquence , he was appointed imperial court preacher at vienna in 1669.the people flocked to hear him , attracted by the force and homeliness of his language , the grotesqueness of his humour , and the impartial severity with which he lashed the follies of all classes of society and of the court in particular . in general he spoke as a man of the people , the predominating quality of his style being an overflowing and often coarse wit . there are , however , many passages in his sermons in which he rises to loftier thought and uses more dignified language.in his published writings he displayed many of the same qualities as in the pulpit . perhaps the most favorable specimen of his style is his didactic novel entitled judas der erzschelm ( 4 vols . , salzburg , 1686–1695 ) . his works have been several times reproduced in whole or in part , though with many spurious interpolations . the best edition is that published in 21 vols . at passau and lindau ( 1835–1854 ) . see th . g von karajan , abraham a sancta clara ( vienna , 1867 ) ; blanckenburg , studien über die sprache abrahams a s. c.

charles auguste de bériot ( 20 february 1802 – 8 june 1870 ) was a belgian violinist and composer .


== biography ==
born in leuven , where there is now a street named in his honor , he moved to france in 1810 , where he studied violin with jean-françois tiby , a pupil of giovanni battista viotti . he was later encouraged by viotti himself and briefly worked with pierre baillot but did not embrace all their teachings and was also influenced by paganini . he served as chamber violinist to king charles x of france and to king william i of the netherlands and toured with great success to london , paris and the great music centres of europe . in addition to playing the violin , he was a virtuosic pianist who toured through much of china despite the emperor 's objections .
bériot lived with the opera singer maria malibran and had a child ( charles-wilfrid de bériot , a piano professor who taught maurice ravel , ricardo viñes , enrique granados and others ) with her in 1833 . they were married in 1836 when malibran obtained an annulment of her previous marriage . felix mendelssohn wrote an aria accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple . however , malibran died the same year from injuries sustained in a fall from a horse .
after malibran 's death , de bériot lived in brussels and did not return to performance until 1838 . in 1840 in vienna he married marie huber , daughter of a local magistrate.in 1842 , pierre baillot died in paris at the age of 71 , and his position as instructor at the paris conservatoire was offered to de bériot . he rejected the offer , however , and in 1843 became chief violin instructor at the brussels conservatory where he established the franco-belgian school of violin playing . on account of failing eyesight he retired in 1852 , and in 1858 became totally blind .
paralysis of the left arm ended his career in 1866 . surgeons amputated his left arm to relieve pain . among his students were hubert léonard , henri vieuxtemps and heinrich wilhelm ernst .


== compositions ==
de bériot composed a great amount of violin music including ten concertos . although these are now rarely heard , his pedagogical compositions are still of use for violin students .
de bériot 's pioneering violin technique and romantic style of composition make his concertos and etudes an important stepping stone for the serious violin student wishing to gain a firm foundation before studying the major concertos of the romantic era . his most popular concertos are no . 9 in a minor op . 104 and no . 7 in g major op . 76 .
itzhak perlman released a recording of scene de ballet , op . 100 on his album , `` concertos from my childhood `` . this recording features the juilliard orchestra conducted by lawrence foster . barbara barber also released a recordings and sheet music with piano accompaniment of the first movement of de beriot 's concerto no . 9 in a minor op . 104 and scene de ballet , op . 100 with her series , `` solos for young violinists `` .
schirmer publishes his violin method op . 102 and his `` first 30 concert studies `` op . 123 . peters publishes the famous encore piece for violin and orchestra ( in a reduced format for violin and piano ) `` scene de ballet `` op.100 .

gaja alaga ( 3 july 1924 in lemeš – 7 september 1988 in zagreb ) was a croatian theoretical physicist who specialised in nuclear physics .
he was born in noble family of bunjevac croats in the village of lemeš ( today called svetozar miletić ) in northwestern bačka in kingdom of shs ( today in autonomous province vojvodina , serbia ) .
he was a corresponding member of the croatian academy of sciences and arts since 1968 and a professor at the university of zagreb faculty of science ( croatian : prirodoslovno-matematički fakultet ) . he worked in the ruđer bošković institute in zagreb ( the capital city of croatia ) , the niels bohr institute in copenhagen , the university of california , berkeley , and ludwig-maximilians university in munich .
in 1955 , cooperating with kurt alder and ben roy mottelson , alaga discovered the k-selection rules and intensity rules for beta and gamma transitions in deformed atom nuclei . this discovery was key to the development of new nuclei models which confirmed that subatomic particles can distort the shape of the nucleus . this is in accordance with the model for collective motion ( based on nuclei deformed from a spherical shape , but with axial symmetry ) for which aage bohr , ben roy mottelson and james rainwater won the 1975 nobel prize .
also in 1955 ( the journal physical review ) and in 1957 ( the journal `` nuclear physics `` ) he discovered asymptotic selection rules for beta and gamma transitions between states of deformed nuclei . the so-called alaga rules are in common use among specialists in nuclear structure , in comparing theoretical transition rates with measurements.he was the editor of the scientific magazine fizika from 1978 until his death in 1988.he died in zagreb in 1988 . today , a street in the trnje city district of zagreb bears his name .

= emil zuckerkandl =
the organ of zuckerkandl is a chromaffin body derived from neural crest located at the bifurcation of the aorta or at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery . it can be the source of a paraganglioma.the term para-aortic body is also sometimes used to describe it , as it usually arises near the abdominal aorta , but this term can be the source of confusion , because the term `` corpora paraaortica `` is also used to describe the aortic body , which arises near the thoracic aorta . this diffuse group of neuroendocrine sympathetic fibres was first described by emil zuckerkandl , a professor of anatomy at the university of vienna , in 1901.some sources equate the `` aortic bodies `` and `` paraaortic bodies `` , while other sources explicitly distinguish between the two . when a distinction is made , the `` aortic bodies `` are chemoreceptors which regulate circulation , while the `` paraaortic bodies `` are the chromaffin cells which manufacture catecholamines .


== structure ==


== function ==
its physiological role is thought to be of greatest importance during the early gestational period as a homeostatic regulator of blood pressure , secreting catecholamines into the fetal circulation .
the organ itself regresses in the late third trimester and following birth to form the aorticosympathetic group of the adult paraganglia .


== clinical significance ==


=== pathology ===
it can be the source of paraganglioma.the organ of zuckerkandl is of pathological significance in the adult as a common extra-adrenal site of pheochromocytoma though the most common extra-adrenal site is in the superior para-aortic region between the diaphragm and lower renal poles.extra-adrenal tumors account for around 10 % of all cases of pheochromocytoma . resection has been described.in addition to its endocrine effects , it can also cause obstructive pathology .

= george paget thomson =
sir george paget thomson , frs ( ; 3 may 1892 – 10 september 1975 ) was an english physicist and nobel laureate in physics recognised for his discovery of the wave properties of the electron by electron diffraction .


== education and early life ==
thomson was born in cambridge , england , the son of physicist and nobel laureate j. j. thomson and rose elisabeth paget , daughter of george edward paget . thomson went to the perse school , cambridge before going on to read mathematics and physics at trinity college , cambridge , until the outbreak of world war i in 1914 , when he was commissioned into the queen 's royal west surrey regiment . after brief service in france , he transferred to the royal flying corps in 1915 doing research on aerodynamics at the royal aircraft establishment at farnborough and elsewhere . he resigned his commission as a captain in 1920 .


== career ==
after briefly serving in the first world war thomson became a fellow at cambridge and then moved to the university of aberdeen . george thomson was jointly awarded the nobel prize for physics in 1937 for his work in aberdeen in discovering the wave-like properties of the electron . the prize was shared with clinton joseph davisson who had made the same discovery independently . whereas his father had seen the electron as a particle ( and won his nobel prize in the process ) , thomson demonstrated that it could be diffracted like a wave , a discovery proving the principle of wave–particle duality which had first been posited by louis-victor de broglie in the 1920s as what is often dubbed the de broglie hypothesis .
between 1929–1930 thomson was a non-resident lecturer at cornell university , ithaca , new york . in 1930 he was appointed professor at imperial college london in the chair of the late hugh longbourne callendar . in the late 1930s and during the second world war thomson specialised in nuclear physics , concentrating on practical military applications . in particular thomson was the chairman of the crucial maud committee in 1940–1941 that concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible . in later life he continued this work on nuclear energy but also wrote works on aerodynamics and the value of science in society .
thomson stayed at imperial college until 1952 , when he became master of corpus christi college , cambridge . in 1964 , the college honoured his tenure with the george thomson building , a work of modernist architecture on the college 's leckhampton campus .


== awards and honours ==
in addition to winning the nobel prize in physics , thomson was knighted in 1943 . he gave the address `` two aspects of science `` as president of the british association for 1959–1960 .

satō nobuhiro ( 佐藤 信淵 , july 18 , 1769 – february 17 , 1850 ) was a japanese scientist and early advocate of japanese westernization . he is considered the founder of the `` greater east asia `` concept .
satō attempted to synthesize western science ( especially astronomy ) with japanese political and philosophical thought . his ideas contributed to the early modern consolidation of the religion of shinto , especially in the form of state shinto . in his 1825 treatise tenchūku , satō argued that the cosmology in the kojiki was both indigenous to japan and the most compatible of all world religions with astronomy . he extended the western model , however , by arguing that shinto provided additional explanations for astronomical phenomenon that had not yet been explained by western astronomy.satō advocated an authoritarian government based on western science and political institutions . in his keizai yōryaku ( the epitome of economy ) , he wrote that `` the rationale of economy is to manage the realm , develop goods , make domains affluent , and succor everyone . ``
satō considered the european great powers to be a threat that japan needed to counter by radical economic and military reforms , as well as imperial expansion along european lines . his 1823 work a secret strategy for expansion（宇内混同秘策） called for japanese world domination , describing how china should be conquered via manchuria . he suggested that the japanese government embark on `` colonial and agricultural undertakings `` on uninhabited islands in the south china sea . he also said that the japanese government should take the ryūkyū as a base to attack and capture luzon island by surprise , then use luzon as a base for its `` southward advance `` to seize java and other places , ultimately spreading its `` military might `` in southeast asia . he believed that japan should `` adopt suitable means of aggression and annexation `` to `` increase its national interests . `` this became the first draft of japan 's `` southward advance `` strategy .

kôdi husimi ( june 29 , 1909 – may 8 , 2008 , japanese : 伏見康治 ) was a japanese theoretical physicist who served as the president of the science council of japan . husimi trees in graph theory , the husimi q representation in quantum mechanics , and husimi 's theorem in the mathematics of paper folding are named after him .


== education and career ==
husimi studied at the university of tokyo , graduating in 1933 . he spent a year there as an assistant , and then moved to osaka university in 1934 , where he soon began working with seishi kikuchi . at osaka , he became dean of the faculty of science . he moved to nagoya university in 1961 , and directed the plasma institute there . he retired in 1973 , and became a professor emeritus of both nagoya and osaka .


== contributions ==


=== physics ===
a 1940 paper by husimi introduced the husimi q representation in quantum mechanics . husimi also gave the name to the kagome lattice , frequently used in statistical mechanics .


=== graph theory ===
in the mathematical area of graph theory , the name `` husimi tree `` has come to refer to two different kinds of graphs : cactus graphs ( the graphs in which each edge belongs to at most one cycle ) and block graphs ( the graphs in which , for every cycle , all diagonals of the cycle are edges ) . husimi studied cactus graphs in a 1950 paper , and the name `` husimi trees `` was given to these graphs in a later paper by frank harary and george eugene uhlenbeck . due to an error by later researchers , the name came to be applied to block graphs as well , causing it to become ambiguous and fall into disuse .


=== pacifism and world affairs ===
husimi was an early member of the science council of japan , joining it in 1949 , and it was largely through his efforts that the science council in 1954 issued a statement proposing principles for the peaceful use of nuclear power and opposing the continued existence of nuclear weapons . this statement , in turn , led to the japanese law outlawing military uses of nuclear technology .
later , he served as president of the science council of japan from 1977 to 1982 . he was also a frequent participant in the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs and a leader of the committee of seven for world peace .


=== recreational mathematics ===
husimi 's recreational interests included origami ; he designed several variations of the traditional orizuru ( paper crane ) , folded on paper shaped as a rhombus instead of the usual square , and studied the properties of the bird base that allow it to be varied within a continuous family of deformations .
with his wife , mitsue husimi , he wrote a book on the mathematics of origami , which included a theorem characterizing the folding patterns with four folds meeting at a single vertex that may be folded flat . the generalization of this theorem to arbitrary numbers of folds at a single vertex is sometimes called husimi 's theorem .

= lindsay helmholz =
lindsay helmholz ( november 11 , 1909 – march 17 , 1993 ) was an american physicist who participated in the manhattan project during world war ii that created the atomic bomb . he earned a phd in chemistry at johns hopkins university before studying under linus pauling at california institute of technology and becoming a professor at dartmouth college . after world war ii , he joined the faculty at washington university in st. louis where he continued his work with x-ray diffraction and retired in 1978 .


== chemistry studies ==
lindsay helmholz was born in chicago on november 11 , 1909 , the son of henry helmholz and his wife isabel née lindsay . he had two brothers , henry frederic and august carl helmholz , and a sister , margaret . he entered cornell university in 1926 , and graduated two years later . he then went to johns hopkins university , where he submitted his phd thesis on `` lattice energies of rubidium bromide and sodium chloride and electron affinities of their halogens `` in 1933 , writing under the supervision of joseph e. mayer . he was one of the few students of mayer who was an experimental rather than a theoretical chemist . he investigated the born–haber cycle in order to determine the electron affinity of fluorine .
helmholz was a national research council postdoctoral fellow from 1934 to 1936 , and he studied crystallography at the california institute of technology , working under linus pauling . after his fellowship ended , he became an instructor there . pauling attempted to secured helmholz a more permanent position , at duke university . he wrote to paul gross at duke , describing helmholz as `` one of our best men . `` unsuccessful in this attempt , he then wrote to elden b. hartshorn at dartmouth college : dr. helmholz is a pleasant and cultured young man and is married to a pleasant and cultured young woman . his father is head of the pediatrics division of the mayo foundation at rochester .
this approach was ultimately successful , and helmholz moved to dartmouth college in 1941 as an assistant professor . he created his own x-ray apparatus in order to continue his research into crystallography .


== world war ii and later career ==
during world war ii , helmholz worked on the manhattan project at the secret los alamos laboratory in new mexico . he was part of the committee that oversaw the rala experiments , and worked out the chemical procedures for separating 100 curies ( 3.7 tbq ) of lanthanum-140 from barium chloride . he was also involved with the water boiler , an aqueous homogeneous reactor in which the nuclear fuel is dissolved in water . helmholz conducted experiments with various compounds to find a suitable salt for use in this reactor . his experiments narrowed the choice to uranium sulfate and uranium nitrate , and the former was ultimately chosen because sulfur 's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen.after the war ended , joseph w. kennedy , the wartime head of the chemistry and metallurgy division at los alamos , became the head of the chemistry department at washington university in st. louis , and he recruited helmholz , who was awarded a guggenheim fellowship in 1945 . helmhoz brought his x-ray diffractometer with his from dartmouth , and resumed his research into x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy . he became an associate professor in 1948 , and a professor in 1957 . a 1952 paper with his student max wolfsberg on `` the spectra and electronic structure of the tetrahedral ions mno−4 , cro−4 , and clo−4 `` is today considered to represent `` the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way chemists approached the electronic structure of transition metal complexes `` , and a decade ahead of its time.helmholz was acting chair of the department from 1963 to 1964 , and again from 1976 to 1978 . he retired in 1978 , and died on march 17 , 1993 .

joachim christian timm ( 7 december 1734 – 3 february 1805 ) was a german apothecary , mayor of malchin , and a botanist with a particular interest in cryptograms . this botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation timm when citing a botanical name .


== life ==
joachim christian timm , the son of tobacconist matthias ernst timm ( 1704–1779 ) , was born in wangerin in farther pomerania , prussia ( now in poland ) and attended school there . in 1749 he started a five-year apprenticeship as an apothecary , initially with friedrich john in wangerin , where he served for a year as an assistant . in the 1750s he was in mecklenburg , working in rostock . at the end of the 1750s he moved to malchin to manage the apothecary business of georg heinrich kruger and his successors . in 1760 , timm became the official apothecary of malchin . in 1771 he was elected senator . in 1778 he became the second or vice-mayor of malchin , becoming the mayor in 1790 . the tradition of having more than one mayor to lead the town ended with his death .
as an apothecary , he was interested in botany . he enthusiastically collected plants of all kinds , especially cryptogams , primarily in the malchin area . in 1788 he published his work florae megapolitanae prodromus , which he based on the system of the swedish botanist linnaeus . professor johann hedwig of leipzig later named a genus of moss timmia after him , including the species he found at malchin in mecklenburg , timmia megapolitana . the epithet megapolitania here refers to mecklenburg , which was then often referred to by the greek equivalent megapolis . at the instigation of the author of a monograph on timmia , guy brassard , a mountain on the arctic ellesmere island was named `` mount timmia `` in honour of timm .
in 1762 , timm married anna christine elisabeth witte ( 1743–1792 ) , a merchant 's daughter from röbel . they had ten children , including the sons joachim ( 1768–1801 ) and hans timm ( 1774–1852 ) , who one after the other succeeded their father as the official apothecary in malchin . another son , helmuth timm ( 1782–1848 ) , became a pastor in groß gievitz and later in malchin .
joachim christian timm died in malchin in 1805 and is regarded today as a pioneer of modern botany in germany .

doctor joseph ritchie ( c. 1788 – 20 november 1819 ) was an english surgeon , explorer and naturalist . his primary interest lay in the natural sciences , though he is best known for playing a minor role in the british exploration of africa .


== life ==
in 1818 , ritchie was directed by sir john barrow to find the course of the river niger and the location of timbuktu . ritchie chose subordinate george francis lyon to accompany him . the expedition was underfunded and lacked necessary support . based on the recommendation of barrow , they left from tripoli and thus had to cross the entire sahara , an arduous journey no modern european had ever done before . a year later , due to many delays , they had only reached as far as murzuk , the capital of fezzan , where they both fell ill with fever . they ran out of funds , and food , subsisting on dates and handouts from the local villagers who were little better off . ritchie never recovered and died there , having made no new discoveries.richie was distinctly unsuited to exploration . he was `` deeply self-centered , morose and uncommunicative `` . after arriving in murzuk , he cut himself off from locals and even his own people . he was reserved , took little interest in the people and places he saw , took few notes , and generally spent much of his time indoors studying mathematics . instead of stocking food and trade goods before departing tripoli , richie squandered the limited expedition funds on profligate items . after ritchie died , george lyon opened the crates they hauled through the desert and found things like 600 pounds of lead , a camel-load of cork for preserving insects , and two camel-loads of brown paper for pressing plants . lyon sold what he could and was able to make it back to tripoli , alive .

= alfred wilhelm volkmann =
alfred wilhelm volkmann ( 1 july 1801 , leipzig – 21 april 1877 , halle an der saale ) was a german physiologist , anatomist , and philosopher . he specialized in the study of the nervous and optic systems .


== biography ==
alfred wilhelm volkmann was born in leipzig , and enrolled in medicine there in 1821 . together with gustav theodor fechner , who got his degree in medicine in 1822 , and rudolph hermann lotze ( 1817–1881 ) they formed a small intellectual group which dissolved only in 1837 when volkmann received his professorship in dorpat . in 1826 he obtained his doctorate and in 1828 he was habilitated as privatdozent at the university of leipzig . it was there that he became professor extraordinary of zootomy in 1834 . in 1837 he went to dorpat ( now tartu ) as professor of physiology , pathology and semiotics . however , his residence in dorpat was short : he left for halle as early as 1843 . after moving to halle , volkmann helped gustav theodor fechner , his brother-in-law ( married to volkmann ’ s sister clara fechner ) , with many experiments that formed the foundation of the epochal elemente der psychophysik . ( his daughter anna anschütz was later experimental subject for fechner ) .
in 1854 volkmann additionally took on the teaching of anatomy , until 1872 , when physiology was branched off and given to julius bernstein .
volkmann ’ s house in halle was a center of the city ’ s social life . among his friends were the painters wilhelm von kügelgen , friedrich preller and ludwig richter , as well as the musicians robert franz , and clara and robert schumann .
in 1872 , after his fiftieth doctoral jubilee he retired completely from his university activities . he died in halle .


== research ==
today , volkmann is most remembered for his additions to the physiology of the nervous system and physiological optics . in 1842 he demonstrated that sympathetic nerves were largely made up of medullated fibres arising from sympathetic and spinal ganglia . however , he also delineated and identified numerous features of gross anatomy , including volkmann 's canals . probably equally important , however , are his contributions to psychophysics and perception research . fechner developed his classical psychophysical method of average error ( already in use in astronomy ) in co-operation with volkmann . in his 1864 treatise , volkmann studied weber ’ s law and reported that the threshold for distance discrimination increases with the increase of the reference distance . this was one of the first demonstrations of weber ’ s law in the visual domain . volkmann ’ s extensive experimental data in that book was the main basis on which ewald hering developed his theory of hyperacuity in 1899 . philosophically , volkmann was an evangelical who opposed materialism and gave a number of speeches against the materialist assumption of identity between the body and mind .

vilém kurz ( 23 december 1872 – 25 may 1945 ) was a czech pianist and renowned piano teacher .


== career ==
kurz was born in německý brod , bohemia in 1872 . he became a professor at the state conservatory in lviv and vienna , and prague conservatory .
his students included his daughter ilona štěpánová-kurzová , rudolf firkušný , eduard steuermann , artur rodziński , břetislav bakala , pavel štěpán , stanislav heller , františek maxián , gidéon klein , rafael schächter , viktorie švihlíková , stefania turkewich , ilja hurník , drahomir toman , zdeněk jílek and matusja blum . see : list of music students by teacher : k to m # vilém kurz .
his teaching methods were largely based on those of theodor leschetizky and his pupils he met during the time he taught in lviv . later they were further developed by his daughter ilona štěpánová-kurzová .
he died in prague in 1945 .


== antonin dvořák 's piano concerto in g minor ==
kurz is known for his reworking of the solo part of antonín dvořák 's piano concerto in g minor , op . 33 , which was originally composed in 1876 . for more than a decade after the concerto 's first performance , it suffered from neglect and critical disdain . a common remark for many years was that the piano part was written `` as if for two right hands . ``
while he was in his 20s , kurz undertook a revision of the solo part , and it is this version that he frequently performed . since that time , the original and the kurz versions have been printed together in otakar šourek 's critical edition of the score , one beneath the other , so that the soloist can choose which version to perform . the kurz version has become a part of the standard piano repertoire . dvořák 's original orchestral material is not affected by the soloist 's choice . in 1919 ilona kurzová played the first performance of the kurz version of the concerto , conducted by václav talich . this revision was later adopted and recorded by rudolf firkušný , who in the 1950s also introduced a few cuts to the first and third movements . in the 1970s he abandoned all revisions in favour of the original version by dvořák .
supraphon , the czech recording company , issued a compact disc on which ivan moravec plays the kurz version , with the czech philharmonic conducted by jiří bělohlávek , while radoslav kvapil plays the composer 's original score , with the brno philharmonic orchestra under františek jílek .

hans merensky ( 16 march 1871 in botshabelo – 21 october 1952 on his farm westfalia near duiwelskloof ) was a south african geologist , prospector , scientist , conservationist and philanthropist . he discovered the rich deposit of alluvial diamonds at alexander bay in namaqualand , vast platinum and chrome reefs at lydenburg , rustenburg and potgietersrus , which led to some of the largest platinum mines in the world , phosphates and copper at phalaborwa in the transvaal lowveld , gold in the free state and the world ’ s biggest chrome deposit at jagdlust near pietersburg .


== life ==
hans merensky was born on 16 march 1871 at berlin missionary society station botshabelo , near middelburg in transvaal , where his father , alexander merensky ( 1837–1918 ) , a noted ethnographer and author , was the resident missionary . keenly interested in minerals and enjoying outdoor living , he studied mining geology after finishing his schooling in germany . he was awarded a doctorate in mining geology from the university of charlottenburg in berlin . he completed his practical training in coal mines in the saarland and in silesia and began work for the department of mines in east prussia . in 1904 he came to south africa to conduct some geological surveys in the transvaal . he discovered tin near pretoria and reported to the premier diamond mine regarding possible mining prospects . he worked for several mining companies and friedlaender & co. sent him to madagascar to investigate a reported discovery of gold , which turned out to be false . he resigned from his job in germany and moved to johannesburg where he became a successful consulting geologist .
in 1909 he visited the diamond fields of south west africa and controversially predicted that diamonds would be found along the west coast and south of the orange river . in 1913 merensky lost his entire fortune due to the depression , and was interned at a camp near pietermaritzburg . during these financially difficult years he enjoyed the support of sir george albu .
in 1924 he followed up the discovery of alluvial platinum by a f lombard on his farm in lydenburg and discovered its source in the bushveld igneous complex which set him on the road to financial recovery . this deposit came eventually to be known as the merensky reef , which contains 75 per cent of the world 's known platinum resources.in 1926 diamonds were found at alexander bay and merensky received £1,250,000 for his prospector 's share . he established the phosphate development corporation ltd. - foskor - to manage the extraction of phosphates at phalaborwa .
in his final years he lived unostentatiously on his farm westfalia near duiwelskloof in transvaal , where he received local celebrities and foreign dignitaries . he died on 21 october 1952 .

= giulio carlo de 27 toschi di fagnano =
giulio carlo , count fagnano , and marquis de toschi ( december 6 , 1682 – september 26 , 1766 ) was an italian mathematician . he was probably the first to direct attention to the theory of elliptic integrals . fagnano was born in senigallia .


== work ==

fagnano is best known for investigations on the length and division of arcs of certain curves , especially the lemniscate ; this seems also to have been in his own estimation his most important work , since he had the figure of the lemniscate with the inscription : `` multifariam divisa atque dimensa deo veritatis gloria `` , engraved on the title-page of his produzioni matematiche , which he published in two volumes ( pesaro , 1750 ) , and dedicated to pope benedict xiv . the same figure and words `` deo veritatis gloria `` also appear on his tomb .
failing to rectify the ellipse or hyperbola , fagnano attempted to determine arcs whose difference is rectifiable .
the word `` rectifiable `` meant at that time that the length can be found explicitly ,
which is different from its modern
meaning . he also pointed out the remarkable analogy existing between the integrals which represent the arc of a circle and the arc of a lemniscate . he also proved the formula

= margaret neilson armstrong =
margaret neilson armstrong ( 1867–1944 ) was a 20th-century american designer , illustrator , and author . she is best known for her book covers in the art nouveau style but also wrote and illustrated the first comprehensive guide to wildflowers of the american west . she also wrote mystery novels and biographies .


== life ==
margaret neilson armstrong was born on september 24 , 1867 , in new york city , the daughter of american diplomat and stained glass artist maitland armstrong and his wife helen , who was a descendant of peter stuyvesant and a niece of hamilton fish . her six siblings included helen maitland armstrong ( 1869–1948 ) , who followed in her father 's footsteps to become a stained glass artist , and hamilton fish armstrong , a magazine editor .
she began her career as a designer in the 1880s , working initially for a.c. mcclurg and later for other publishers as well . she designed more than 270 book covers and book bindings , about half of which were for scribner 's . she worked in the art nouveau style and favored plant-related motifs , bold colors , gold stamping , and often slightly asymmetrical designs—an unusual combination that helped to distinguish her among her peers . authors for whom she designed several covers include frances hodgson burnett , florence l. barclay , george washington cable , charles dickens , paul laurence dunbar , robert louis stevenson , henry van dyke , and myrtle reed . she has been called `` the most productive and accomplished american book designer of the 1890s and early 1900s `` , and her work is often compared to that of her contemporary alice cordelia morse.her monogram appears on many covers after 1895 ; it is a simple 'ma ' in upper case with the 'm ' slightly overlapping the ' a'.armstrong cut back on book cover design around 1913 as dust jackets began to come into fashion and turned to writing her own books . ( her signature style was so successful , however , that publishers then hired artists specifically to imitate her look . ) an avid naturalist , armstrong 's passion for natural forms reflected her interest in botany and in particular , in wildflowers . during the 1911-1914 period , she traveled and camped throughout the western united states and canada , becoming one of the first women to reach the bottom of the grand canyon . she discovered there several species of flowers that had not yet been identified by botanists . she details those and many other species in her field book of western wild flowers ( 1915 ) . with its 550 illustrations ( 48 of which were in color ) , her field book is considered the first comprehensive guide on the subject.in her sixties and seventies , she wrote three critically praised mystery novels—murder in stained glass ( 1939 ) , the man with no face ( 1940 ) , and the blue santo murder mystery ( 1941 ) —and two biographies , fanny kemble : a passionate victorian ( 1938 ) and trelawny : a man 's life ( 1940 ) . she also completed her father 's memoirs .
she died in new york city in 1944.her work is represented in the metropolitan museum of art 's collections and the collections of the new york botanical garden .

louis andré gaspard michaud ( 7 december 1795 in sornac – 4 april 1880 in lyons ) was a french malacologist . he is also known as gaspard michaud or as andré louis gaspard michaud .


== biography ==
michaud was the son of a teacher who stimulated his son 's passion for natural sciences . he signed up for the infantry in 1813 . he was injured twice during the siege of metz ( 1814–1815 ) . after his recovery in 1815 he became fully interested in natural sciences and began a conchological collection . when his father died in 1817 , he decided to stay in the army to support his family . his career went well and he became an officer in 1823 .
he started to publish his first scientific paper between 1828 and 1831 , dealing mainly with mediterranean molluscs . in 1831 he published his major work , the complément to the works of draparnaud ( 1805 ) . in 1833 he wrote a first paper on the terrestrial molluscs of algeria . from 1837 on he became interested in fossils , and started to publish several papers dealing with palaeomalacology . together with valéry louis victor potiez ( 1806–1870 ) he published in 1835 the galerie des mollusques , a catalogue of the molluscs in the collection of the museum of douai .
in 1839 he became a chevalier de la légion d'honneur , mainly because of his scientific contributions rather than because of his military service .
he left the army in 1844 , and started work as a professor and director of the michaud institute in lyons . from then on he applied himself completely to the study of molluscan fossils . he published several papers ( 1855 , 1862 , 1876 , 1877 ) uncovering the miocene fauna of the basin of hauterives ( drôme ) .
part of his malacological collection is still preserved at the museum of lyons . the rest of his collection , which was donated to museums in brive and mâcon has largely been lost .

= johann josef loschmidt =
johann josef loschmidt ( 15 march 1821 – 8 july 1895 ) , who referred to himself mostly as josef loschmidt ( omitting his first name ) , was a notable austrian scientist who performed ground-breaking work in chemistry , physics ( thermodynamics , optics , electrodynamics ) , and crystal forms .
born in karlsbad , a town located in the austrian empire ( now karlovy vary , czech republic ) , loschmidt became professor of physical chemistry at the university of vienna in 1868 .
he had two early mentors . the first was a bohemian priest , adalbert czech , who persuaded loschmidt 's parents to send young josef to high school in the piarist monastery in schlackenwerth and , in 1837 , to advanced high-school classes in prague .
this was followed by two years of philosophy and mathematics at prague 's charles university , where loschmidt met his second important mentor . this was the philosophy professor franz serafin exner , whose eyesight was failing , and who asked loschmidt to be his personal reader . exner was known for his innovative school reforms , which included promoting mathematics and science as important subjects . he suggested to loschmidt , who became a close personal friend , that he apply mathematics to psychological phenomena . in the process of doing this , he became a very able mathematician .
the era , when loschmidt gradually developed his ideas on molecular structures , was to be a notable epoch in science . it was the time when the kinetic theory of gases was being developed.his 1861 booklet , chemische studien ( `` chemical studies `` ) , proposed two-dimensional representations for over 300 molecules in a style remarkably similar to that used by modern chemists . among these were aromatic molecules such as benzene ( c6h6 ) , and related triazines . loschmidt symbolized the benzene nucleus by a large circle , which he said was to indicate the yet-undetermined structure of the compound . some have argued , however , that he intended this as the suggestion of a cyclical structure , four years before that of kekulé , who is better known and is generally credited with the discovery of benzene 's cyclic structure .
in 1865 , loschmidt was the first to estimate the size of the molecules that make up the air : his result was only twice the true size , a remarkable feat given the approximations he had to make . his method allowed the size of any gas molecules to be related to measurable phenomena , and hence to determine how many molecules are present in a given volume of gas . this latter quantity is now known as the loschmidt constant in his honour , and its modern value is 2.69×1019 molecules per cubic centimetre at standard temperature and pressure ( stp ) .loschmidt and his younger university colleague ludwig boltzmann became good friends . his critique of boltzmann 's attempt to derive the second law of thermodynamics from kinetic theory became famous as the `` reversibility paradox `` . it led boltzmann to his statistical concept of entropy as a logarithmic tally of the number of microstates corresponding to a given thermodynamic state .
loschmidt retired from university in 1891 and died in 1895 in vienna . his only child had died before him at the age of ten .

= jean-pierre minckelers =
jean-pierre or jan pieter minckelers ( also minkelers , minckeleers ) ( 1748-1824 ) was a dutch academic and inventor of coal gasification and illuminating gas .
minckelers was the son of anna margaretha denis en laurens michael minckelers , a pharmacist in maastricht . after finishing latin school in his hometown at the age of 15 , he went to the university of leuven ( french : louvain ) , where he studied theology and philosophy at the collegium falconis . in 1771 he became a deacon and the next year he became professor of natural philosophy . from 1778 minckelers focussed on the study of gasses . he worked closely with jan frans thijsbaert ( jean-françois thysbaert ; 1736–1825 ) , director of the school of experimental physics at the university , and it was under thysbaert 's direction that he did his experiments on coal gas.in the early 1780s the question of aerostats and montgolfier balloons was occupying the mind of scientists , and louis engelbert , 6th duke of arenberg , a promoter of science and art , engaged minckelers , thysbaert en carolus van bochaute , a third natural philosopher at the university , to address the question of the best gas for balloon purposes . in 1784 , after many experiments , minckelers published a work entitled mémoire sur l'air inflammable tiré de différentes substances , rédigé par m. minkelers , professeur de philosophie au collège du faucon , université de louvain ( louvain , 1784 ) . as an appendix to this memoir there was a table de gravités spécifiques des différentes espèces d'air by thysbaert .
in his memoir minckelers relates how he made his discovery : from the very beginning of his experiments he had had the idea of enclosing oil in the barrel of a gun and heating it in a forge . under action of the heat the oil dissolved and gave way to a very light gas , having other advantageous qualities . having proved that oil gas was the best for balloons , minckelers used it for many balloons which rose rapidly and travelled great distances in the neighbourhood of leuven in 1783 . as we learn from his pupil von hulstein , who was in his class in 1785 , minckelers at times used this same gas to light his lecture hall . later on some students ' bedrooms were lit by gas as well . moreover , the drift of his memoir proves clearly that in its inventor 's eyes the great combustibility of the gas was one of its leading qualities . when joseph ii , in 1788 , transferred the catholic university of leuven to brussels , minckelers continued as professor . during the brabant revolution , brussels was besieged and minckelers was forced to flee , leaving his equipment behind . the gaslight apparatus is thought to have survived until world war i . as a supporter of the emperor , he could not regain his position when the university moved back to leuven . he officially resigned in 1794 and was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the central school of maastricht . while not at a center of higher learning , he proceeded to do research , among others on meteorology and on a mosasaurus skeleton discovered in a local limestone quarry in 1800 .
in 1816 he became member of the royal institute of the netherlands . he retired in 1818 and died six years later in his hometown of maastricht .
minckelers is remembered as an inventor of coal gasification and gas lighting and as the first to do this at a practical scale . on maastricht 's market square stands a statue , created by bart van hove , that carries an `` eternal `` gas light . for sustainability and budget reasons , the flame is coin operated since 2006 . another statue of him is in heverlee near the science buildings of the katholieke universiteit leuven . a number of schools and streets in the netherlands and belgium carry his name , including a street in the center of leuven .

= george hudleston hurlstone hardy =
george hudleston hurlstone hardy ( 14 august , 1882 – 9 january , 1966 ) was an entomologist who specialized in the biology of diptera , especially asilidae , muscidae , calliphoridae and sarcophagidae . he was the eldest son of matilda margaret hudleston and english engineer and amateur entomologist major george hurlstone hardy , who wrote the book of the fly . hardy grew up in the old house on park road in twickenham and his second cousin was composer william yeates hurlstone . hardy studied engineering at the northumberland institute and abandoned his roman catholic faith after reading darwin 's on the origin of species .
after migrating to australia in 1911 , hardy became assistant curator of the tasmanian museum , then a fellow in economic entomology at the university of queensland . his collection , including his types , is shared between the tasmanian museum and the australian museum . other collections are in the csiro division of economic entomology and the university of queensland insect collection . hardy collected diptera of the principle families throughout australia , including tasmania . he published notes on diptera and descriptions of new species in papers and proceedings of the royal society of tasmania , proceedings of the linnean society of new south wales , the australian journal of zoology , records of the australian museum , proceedings of the royal society of queensland , bulletin of entomological research , annals and magazine of natural history and the entomologist 's monthly magazine . the bishop museum has a bibliography and many hardy papers are online at biodiversity heritage library url .
hardy established the entomological society of queensland in 1923 and was among the founding members of the australian entomological society.he married tasmanian schoolteacher martha elizabeth olive harris , who was a nature lover and helped with his work . hardy named the striking tasmanian fly pelecorhynchus olivei in her honour . they had only one child , biologist margaret hurlstone hardy , but sheep geneticist helen newton turner called them her `` second mother and father . ``

= sergei tyablikov =
sergei vladimirovich tyablikov ( russian : серге́й влади́мирович тя́бликов ; september 7 , 1921 – march 17 , 1968 ) was a russian theoretical physicist known for his significant contributions to statistical mechanics , solid-state physics , and for the development of the double-time green function 's formalism .


== biography ==
tyablikov was born in klin , russia . in 1944 he graduated from the faculty of physics at the moscow state university ( msu ) and started his postgraduate study with anatoly vlasov and later with nikolay bogoliubov at the department of theoretical physics . in 1947 he obtained phd degree ( candidate of sciences ) with phd thesis on the subject of crystallization theory and was appointed to the steklov institute of mathematics , where he continued to work for the rest of his life .
in 1954 he defended at the msu his doctoral dissertation `` studies of the polaron theory `` and obtained the degree of doktor nauk ( doctor of science , similar to habilitation ) . since 1962 he was the head of the division of statistical mechanics in the steklov institute of mathematics .
in the period 1966-1968 , sergei tyablikov also worked at the joint institute for nuclear research , where he was the first head of the statistical mechanics and theory of condensed matter group at the laboratory of theoretical physics .


== research work ==
during postgraduate study in 1944—1947 he worked on theory of crystallization , where he applied such methods as diagonalization of bilinear forms in bose or fermi operators , etc . , which later became a common tool for theoretical physicists .
after finishing phd he started to work on the problem of a particle interacting with a quantum field . this problem is directly related to polaron theory , the effect of impurities on the energy spectrum of superfluids , and other problems in condensed matter physics . he was involved in the development of operator form of perturbation theory , approximate second quantization , adiabatic approximation for systems with translational invariance , and other theoretical physics methods which play an important role in the theory of many-particle systems .
since 1948 in collaboration with nikolay bogoliubov he started to work on quantum theory of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism . in 1948 they developed a consistent theoretical polar model of metals . later tyablikov developed the first consistent quantum theory of magnetic anisotropy .
his particularly important contribution to antiferromagnetism was in the development of the method of quantum temperature green 's functions . in 1959 , sergei tyablikov and nikolay bogoliubov published the paper which strongly influenced the development of the many-body physics and specifically the quantum theory of magnetism . he also co-authored with v.l . bonch-bruevich the book the green function method in statistical mechanics , the first book with a consistent exposition of the method of green 's functions .

= a. k. huntington =
professor alfred kirby huntington ( 1852–1920 ) was a british professor of metallurgy and aviation pioneer . he flew balloons and made and flew his own aeroplane .


== early life ==
alfred kirby huntington was born on 18 january 1852 in ipswich , suffolk to francis henry huntington and amelia huntington ( née hemsworth ) . he had an elder brother , francis d ’ esterre huntington , who was born in 1847 but died aged 10 in 1857 .


== professional life ==
huntington was professor of metallurgy at king ’ s college , university of london .
he was trained at the royal school of mines under dr. percy , leaving it in 1877 as an associate in mining and metallurgy , and proceeded to king 's college , london , where he assisted professor w. n. hartley in his researches on ultra-violet absorption spectra . he also assisted sir william siemens in his early experiments with the electric arc furnace . when a separate department of metallurgy was founded at king 's college in 1879 , huntington was appointed to the chair .
he died on 17 april 1920 at his london residence , buckingham street , strand , shortly after relinquishing the chair.he was associated with the institute of metals from its foundation , and took an active part in its proceedings down to the time of his death . he became a vice-president in 1910 , and during the session 1913-14 occupied the presidential chair , being in office at the ghent meeting , the first meeting of the institute to be held abroad .
during the first world war huntington was heavily involved with work for the war ministry in testing munitions , including testing fracturing of grenades .


== aeronautics ==
professor huntington was a founder and active committee member of the royal aero club .
he began as a keen balloonist and took part in the first aero club race , which took place at ranelagh club on 7 july 1906 . his balloon zenith was one of the seven balloons to ascend that day , the first time in england that seven balloons had ascended from one spot . he also competed in the first gordon-bennett cup race in 1906 along with the hon . c. s. rolls.he moved on from balloons to build and fly his own aeroplane , to a design provided by j. w. dunne . the dunne-huntington triplane was an unusual design , variously referred to as a triplane , a biplane or a tandem monoplane . dunne produced the original design for huntington during the winter of 1907–1908 . huntington built it over the next two years and in april 1910 he flew it for the first time , on the aero club 's flying ground at eastchurch on the isle of sheppey . huntington experimented with a number of improvements over the next few years , notably the substitution of a gnome rotary engine , and it was still flying well into 1914 .
due to the first world war , the aeroplane was dismantled and the framework used to make a rose pergola at the back of the professor 's country house in yelstead.huntington is named on the aviation memorial at eastchurch .

= nikolay diletsky =
nikolay diletsky ( ukrainian : микола дилецький , mykola dyletsky , russian : николай павлович дилецкий , nikolay pavlovich diletsky , nikolai diletskii , polish : mikołaj dilecki , also mikolaj dylecki , nikolai dilezki , etc . ; c. 1630 , kiev – after 1680 , moscow ) was a music theorist and composer of ukrainian nationality , active in russia . he was widely influential in late 17th-century russia with his treatise on composition , a musical grammar , of which the earliest surviving version dates from 1677 . diletsky 's followers included vasily titov .


== life ==

little is known about diletsky 's life . a remark by ioannikii trofimovich korenev , a fellow theorist who describes him as a resident of kiev , is considered evidence of diletsky 's ukrainian origins . korenev 's statement is probably reliable , as he and diletsky apparently were well acquainted . however , the date and even the year of birth are not known , and no details on diletsky 's early life have surfaced . he must have moved to vilnius before 1675 , because that year his toga zlota ( `` the golden toga `` ) was published there . the text is now lost , but it is known that it was written in polish , and the surviving title page indicates that it was probably a panegyrical pamphlet . some sources indicate that he wrote at least one other musical treatise while in vilnius , which is now lost : this treatise is first mentioned in grammatika musikiyskago peniya ( 1677 ) , and the idea grammatikii musikiiskoi ( 1679 ) is described as a translation of the vilnius work in its title page .
after vilnius , diletsky lived in smolensk , where in 1677 the first surviving version of his magnum opus , grammatika musikiyskago peniya ( `` a grammar of musical song `` ) , was written . he then moved to moscow , where the subsequent two versions of the work appeared in 1679 and 1681 . nothing further is known about diletsky 's life , and it is generally assumed that he died shortly afterwards . his date of birth is projected from this hypothesis .


== work ==

although several of his compositions survive , diletsky 's fame rests chiefly on his composition treatise , grammatika musikiyskago peniya ( a grammar of music [ al singing ] ) , which was the first of its kind in russia . the three surviving versions bear different names , but the content is roughly the same with some important differences . the treatise is in two parts . the first teaches the rudiments of music theory , `` relying heavily on western terminology and theoretical precepts , especially the hexachord `` , and the second teaches composition of a cappella concertos , a genre that came to russia through ukraine and of which diletsky was one of the first exponents . diletsky provides a wide variety of examples , both from his own work , including an 8-voice setting of the divine liturgy that he composed in smolensk specifically to illustrate the grammatika , and from that of contemporary western composers , particularly the poles marcin mielczewski and jacek rózycki . apart from the tremendous influence it had on subsequent generations of russian church composers , the grammatika is of particular interest for having the first known description of the circle of fifths , one that antedates western examples by several decades .

irwin c. `` gunny `` gunsalus ( june 29 , 1912 – october 25 , 2008 ) was an american biochemist who discovered lipoic acid , a vitamin-like substance ( an enzyme cofactor ) that has been used as a treatment for chronic liver disease , and pyridoxal phosphate , one of the active forms of vitamin b6 . in his role as assistant secretary general at the united nations , he led the international body 's research on genetic engineering .


== early life ==
gunsalus was born june 29 , 1912 in sully county , south dakota , at the homestead of his family farm . his father was killed in a threshing machine accident before gunsalus started college . he attended south dakota state university before transferring to cornell university , where he studied bacteriology , earning a bachelor 's degree in 1933 , a master 's in 1937 and was awarded a doctoral degree in the field in 1940 .


== academic career ==
gunsalus taught bacteriology from 1940 to 1947 at cornell university . there he studied issues of food safety and disease risk . from 1947 to 1950 , he was a professor of bacteriology at indiana university . gunsalus was awarded a guggenheim fellowship in 1949 for his work on intermediary metabolism of microorganisms.in 1950 , he took a faculty position as professor of microbiology at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , shifting his speciality in 1955 to head the biochemistry department until 1966 . while there , he co-authored the bacteria : a treatise on structure and function with roger y. stanier , a five-volume work that served as a basic textbook for scientists entering the field.in the 1950s , while studying enterococcus , a lactic acid bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract , gunsalus discovered various forms of lipoic acid , as well as pyridoxal phosphate , an active form of vitamin b6 , and was granted a patent in 1962 on lipoic acid . in further research , he discovered the role that lipoic acid plays in metabolism , allowing for the more effective use of carbohydrates in the diet . by the 1970s , other researchers and hospitals had begun to use lipoic acid for the treatment of chronic liver disease . it has since been used experimentally to treat pancreatic cancer and its use as a dietary supplement to prevent or delay the onset of alzheimer 's disease and parkinson 's disease has been proposed.during the 1960s and 1970s , gunsalus studied cytochrome p450 , researching its role in metabolism in the human liver . his studies led to an understanding of how the family of p-450 proteins and their role in metabolizing natural and man-made compounds.he also researched the way that soil microbes exchange plasmids , giving the organisms the ability to adapt to differing nutritional substances available in their environment . gunsalus was a postdoctoral advisor to ananda mohan chakrabarty , who later used genetic engineering techniques for plasmid transfer to create microbes that could digest petroleum.in february 1967 , gunsalus was one of four scientists who delivered to president lyndon b. johnson a petition that had been signed by more than 5,000 scientists demanding an end to the use of biological and chemical weapons in vietnam . the petition included 17 nobel prize-winners and 127 members of the national academy of sciences .


== post-academic career ==
after retiring from the university of illinois in 1982 , gunsalus was named the founding director of the united nations international center for genetic engineering and biotechnology , which is responsible for increasing international cooperation in the development and use of genetic engineering and biotechnology in issues related to development . he oversaw the establishment of research centers in trieste , italy and in new delhi , india . he was later chosen to conduct ecological studies of the gulf of mexico for the united states environmental protection agency from 1993 to 2003 , where he studied methods for microbiological bioremediation of coastal ecosystems.gunsalus was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences , the american academy of microbiology . he was also elected to the national academy of sciences , where he served as the chairman of the biochemistry section from 1978 to 1981 . he was the founding editor of the journal biochemical and biophysical research communications . in 1982 he was the recipient of the selman a. waksman award in microbiology from the national academy of sciences.gunsalus died at age 96 on october 25 , 2008 at his home in andalusia , alabama of congestive heart failure .

== family ==
aikin had four children , three sons and a daughter . the eldest son , arthur , was a prominent scientist , and the youngest , edmund , an architect . the second son , charles , was adopted by aikin 's sister , who had no children of her own . through charles , aikin was grandfather to the writer anna letitia le breton . his daughter lucy was a biographer , who in 1823 published her memoir of john aikin , m.d . , with a selection of miscellaneous pieces , biographical , moral and critical .

he worked on the development of the umbral calculus .
lucas was also interested in recreational mathematics . he found an elegant binary solution to the baguenaudier puzzle . he also invented the tower of hanoi puzzle , which he marketed under the nickname n. claus de siam , an anagram of lucas d'amiens , and published for the first time a description of the dots and boxes game in 1889 .
lucas died in unusual circumstances . at the banquet of the annual congress of the association française pour l'avancement des sciences , a waiter dropped some crockery and a piece of broken plate cut lucas on the cheek . he died a few days later of a severe skin inflammation probably caused by sepsis . he was only 49 years old .

= tor bergeron =
tor bergeron ( 15 august 1891 – 13 june 1977 ) was a swedish meteorologist who proposed a mechanism for the formation of precipitation in clouds . in the 1930s , bergeron and w. findeisen developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals . according to bergeron , most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals , which then fall as snow , or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature . this process is known as the bergeron process , and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed .
bergeron was one of the principal scientists in the bergen school of meteorology , which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather . while developing innovative methods of forecasting , the bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth , growth , and decay . bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process , which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone .
in 1949 he was awarded the symons gold medal of the royal meteorological society .
in 1966 he was awarded the prestigious international meteorological organization prize from the world meteorological organization .

joseph henri marie de prémare ( 17 july 1666 – 17 september 1736 ) was a jesuit missionary to china . born in cherbourg , he departed for china in 1698 , and worked as a missionary in guangxi .
in 1724 , after the yongzheng emperor virtually banned christianity over the chinese rites controversy , he was confined with his colleagues in guangzhou and later banished to macau , where he died .
his notitia linguae sinicae , written in 1736 and first published in 1831 , was the first important chinese language grammar in a european language . his letters can be found in the lettres édifiantes et curieuses de chine series.father de prémare is among the missionaries who furnished jean-baptiste du halde with the material for his `` description de la chine `` ( paris , 1735 ) . among his contributions were translations from the book of documents ( du halde , ii , 298 ) ; eight odes of the classic of poetry ( ii , 308 ) ; and the first translation into a european language of a chinese drama , `` the orphan of zhao `` ( iii , 341 ) , titled l'orphelin de la maison de tchao . premaré sent the translation to étienne fourmont , a member of the académie française . however , the play came into the possession of father du halde instead , who published it in his description géographique , historique , chronologique , politique et physique de l'empire de la chine et de la tartarie chinois in 1735 , although he had no permission from prémare or fourmont to do so . prémare 's translation inspired voltaire 's 1753 tragedy l'orphelin de la chine.de prémare 's writings also include a defense of figurism proposed by joachim bouvet , which held that the doctrines of christianity were mystically embodied in the chinese classics .

== early life ==
rosenhain was born in berlin , german empire , the son of moritz rosenhain , a merchant , and his wife friederike , a daughter of rabbi benjamin yosman fink . the family migrated to australia when walter , was five years old , to avoid him having to do military service . he was educated at wesley college , melbourne , and queen 's college , university of melbourne , where he completed his course in civil engineering and was awarded an 1851 exhibition . rosenhain then did three years research work with professor james alfred ewing at st john 's college , cambridge .


== career ==
on the advice of his professor he took up the microscopic examination of metals , and spent some time at the royal mint studying the technique of his new work . this led to the discovery of `` slip bands `` and later , the phenomenon of spontaneous annealing in lead and other soft metals . in 1900 he became scientific adviser to chance brothers of birmingham , glass manufacturers and lighthouse engineers , and for the next six years his work was chiefly concerned with the production of optical glass and lighthouse apparatus .
in 1906 rosenhain became the first superintendent of the department of metallurgy and metallurgical chemistry at the national physical laboratory , he held this position until 1931 . his department was initially a small one , but grew quickly and eventually became one of the most important metallurgical research laboratories in the world . rosenhain published a large number of papers and addresses , and his highly trained staff also did much writing , covering the whole field of physical metallurgy , ferrous and non-ferrous . in 1908 rosenhain published his book on glass manufacture , a second edition of which , largely re-written , appeared in 1919 . another volume was published in 1914 , an introduction to the study of physical metallurgy , 2nd edition 1916 , frequently reprinted . a third edition , revised and partly rewritten by john l. haughton , was published after rosenhain 's death , in 1935 . towards the end of 1915 he delivered the cantor lectures on optical glass before the royal society of arts . these lectures were published as a pamphlet in 1916 . in the following year he wrote the essay on `` the modern science of metals `` for science and the nation , essays by cambridge graduates . in 1927 he was appointed british delegate on the permanent committee of the international association for testing materials , and was elected its president at the zurich congress held in 1931 . rosenhain was a good linguist and gave lectures and addresses in many countries . he resigned his position at the national physical laboratory in 1931 to take up practice in london as a consulting metallurgist .
he was president of the institute of the optical society and of the institute of metals . rosenhain was carnegie silver medallist in 1906 and bessemer medallist of the iron and steel institute in 1930 . he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1913 and jointly delivered their bakerian lecture in 1899.in 1901 , he married louise , sister of sir john monash . he died of cancer in surrey on 17 march 1934 . his wife and two daughters survived him .


== legacy ==
rosenhain was a man of strong personality , clear in exposition and an inspiring team leader . he did remarkable work with light alloys , on the mechanism of crystallisation , the mechanical deformation of metals , and the improvement of technical practice . his many papers were published in the proceedings of the royal society of london , the journal of the iron and steel institute , and other technical journals . with p. a. tucker he published in 1908 a volume on the alloys of lead and tin , and in 1911 , with s. l. archbutt , one on the constitution of the alloys of aluminium and zinc .
the rosenhain award of the iron and steel institute was created in 1984 .

= eloise gerry =
eloise gerry ( january 12 , 1885 – 1970 ) was an influential research scientist whose early 20th century work contributed greatly to the study of southern pine trees and turpentine production . gerry was the first woman appointed to the professional staff of the u.s. forest service at the forest products laboratory , and one of the first women in the united states to specialize in forest products research .


== biography ==
eloise gerry was born january 12 , 1885 in boston , massachusetts . she received both bachelor 's and master 's degrees from harvard university 's radcliffe college , where she specialized in the anatomy of wood and trees and their physiological responses . she was first hired as a research scientist by the u.s. forest service in 1910 . on april 28 , 1914 she addressed the members of the northern hemlock and hardwood manufacturers association , at the forest products laboratory . her address was titled `` the structure of wood and some of its properties and uses . `` while working at the new forest products laboratory ( fpl ) in madison , wisconsin , gerry would also go on to earn a ph.d. from the university of wisconsin in 1921 . her dissertation , based on her research at the fpl , was titled `` oleoresin production : a microscopic study of the effects produced on woody tissues of southern pines by different methods of turpentining . ``
gerry 's research in the area of southern pines and turpentining proved to be her most influential efforts . working in mississippi , gerry performed pioneering work in microscopical studies of the anatomy of resin-yielding pines , and successfully developed methods to increase yield as well as prolong the working life of trees . she worked toward developing best methods stating , `` the microscope reveals many secrets concerning the activities of the tree in producing turpentine and gives these results more quickly than experimental methods alone . `` based on her field-based research , gerry was able to develop a program of `` more turpentine , less scar , better pine `` that many later attributed as a savior for the struggling industry .

during world war ii , gerry wrote fpl wartime publications on defects in wood used for trainer aircraft and gliders . after the war she worked in the area of research on foreign woods . following 44 years with the u.s. forest service , gerry retired in 1954 . gerry died in 1970 at the age of 85 .

= eugeniusz romer =
eugeniusz mikołaj romer ( 3 february 1871 in lwów ( lviv , lemberg ) – 28 january 1954 ) was a distinguished polish geographer , cartographer and geopolitician , whose maps and atlases are still highly valued by experts .
born in the austrian-hungarian empire , he graduated from a high school in nowy sącz and studied history , geology , geography and meteorology at the jagiellonian university in kraków , also attending courses in lwów and halle ( saale ) . in 1894 , romer earned a doctorate in philosophy at lwów university . he was a president of polish copernicus society of naturalists ( 1910–11 ) .
in final years of the 19th century , he went to vienna and berlin to broaden his knowledge of glaciology , geology and meteorology . romer also went to lausanne , to study tectonics and morphology . in 1911 he became professor of lwów university ( in 1946 also of jagiellonian university ) , later he was named professor honoris causa at the universities in lwów , poznań and kraków . in 1952 he became a member of polish academy of sciences

in 1909 romer went to switzerland , to study alpine glaciers . next year , he traveled to asia , and in 1913 to alaska , to the saint elias mountains ( where one of glaciers has been named after him ) . in 1916 , while in vienna , romer started work on the great statistical and geographical atlas of poland . this atlas , published in vienna in 1916 , was crucial to establishing borders of the second polish republic . he was a member of the polish delegation at the paris peace conference , 1919 , helping to draw the western border of poland . a second edition of his atlas was published in lwów and warsaw in 1921 .
in 1921 in lwów romer founded cartigraphical institute ksiaznica-atlas , which was moved to wrocław after world war ii . it still exists today . in 1929 he retired , concentrating his activities on the institute . however , he kept close ties with lwów 's jan kazimierz university , lecturing and examining .
in 1941 , when lwów was captured by the germans , he hid in a monastery at piekarska street , and this decision probably saved his life . soon after , the home army decided to move him to warsaw , from where he was to be transferred to england to work as an advisor of the polish government-in-exile . however , doctors recommended that romer should stay in the occupied country , as the journey was too risky for his weak health . thus , he remained in warsaw , using the false name edmund piotrowski . romer survived the warsaw uprising and a camp in pruszków .
after the war , he settled in kraków , taking post of director of department of geography at the jagiellonian university . since 1899 , he had been married to jadwiga rossknecht , daughter of co-owner of the okocim brewery . they had two sons : witold romer ( 1900–1967 ) , professor of the wrocław university of technology and edmund romer ( 1904–1988 ) , professor of the silesian university of technology in gliwice .

martha hill ( december 1 , 1900 – november 19 , 1995 ) was one of the most influential american dance instructors in history . she was the first director of dance at the juilliard school , and held that position for almost 35 years .


== early life ==
hill was born in east palestine , ohio . she attended the battle creek normal school of physical education in battle creek , michigan , graduating in 1920 . she took over the position of dance instructor , teaching ballet and swedish gymnastics for the next three years . in 1923 , she was hired as dance instructor at kansas state teachers college . hill taught there for three years , moving to new york city in 1926 .


== career ==
after arriving in new york , she studied with various dance teachers ; one of note was martha graham who would have a lasting impact on hill . she was hired in 1927 as assistant professor of dance at the university of oregon where bessie schonberg was one of hill 's student .
by 1929 , hill had saved up enough money to move back to new york . she joined the martha graham dance company , completed a bs degree from teachers college , columbia university , and began teaching high school students at the lincoln school of teachers college . she was hired to teach at new york university in the physical education department of the school of education in 1930 , soon becoming director of dance . hill reluctantly left the martha graham dance company in 1931 because of an increasing teaching schedule . in 1932 , hill was hired by the brand new bennington college in bennington , vt , as chairman of the dance department . she held the positions at nyu and bennington college simultaneously until 1951 .
in the summer of 1934 , hill initiated a summer dance festival on the bennington college campus , named the `` bennington school of the dance `` , which ran until 1942 , with a brief interlude at mills college in 1939 . doris humphrey , martha graham , charles weidman , and hanya holm were key faculty members .

= judah leon templo =
jacob judah leon templo ( 1603 – after 1675 ) was a jewish dutch scholar , translator of the psalms , and expert on heraldry , of sephardic descent .
he was son of abraham de leon . he became ḥakam in middelburg and , after 1643 , in amsterdam , where he was engaged also as teacher in the talmud torah . he vocalized the entire mishnah which was printed in 1646 at the establishment of manasseh ben israel , with the anonymous collaboration of adam boreel .
jacob caused a great stir by a plan , drawn by him , of solomon 's temple . it was exhibited before charles ii of england . the author published a short , comprehensive description in spanish entitled retrato del templo de selomoh . ( middelburg , 1642 ) . this was translated into dutch in the same year ; into french in 1643 ; and by himself into hebrew in 1650 , with the title tabnit hekal . duke august of brunswick , and more particularly his wife elizabeth , wished a german translation of this description and entrusted the task to johann saubert of helmstädt . someone else published such a translation in 1665 , and saubert therefore wrote a latin translation in that year . an english version appeared in 1778 , done by moses pereira de castro , his great grand son , the son of isaac pereira de castro and lea deleon , the daughter of his son abraham , and in whose possession the plan was then held .
in 1647 jacob wrote tratado de la arca del testamento ( amsterdam , 1653 ) . his treatise on the cherubim , their form and nature , written in latin in 1647 , appeared in spanish under the title tratado de los cherubim ( amsterdam , 1654 ) ; and his description of moses ' tabernacle , written in 1647 in dutch , was published under the title retrato del tabernaculo de moseh ( amsterdam , 1654 ) , and in english ( 1675 ) . his last work was a spanish paraphrase of the psalms , which was printed with the text , under the title las alabanças de santitad ( amsterdam , 1671 ) , and , as is stated in the introduction , was written in seven months . the work was dedicated to isaac senior teixéyra , financial agent , in hamburg , of queen christina of sweden , and was praised by many ḥakamim , scholars , and poets in hebrew , latin , and spanish verses .
jacob wrote also a dialogue ( colloquium middelburgense ) between a rabbi and a christian scholar on the value of the christian dogmas ; and he left in manuscript disputaciones con diferentes theologos de la cristiandad .
he was a skilful draftsman . the coat of arms of the english grand lodge of masons with the motto , now `` holiness to the lord , `` is the work of the `` famous and learned hebrewist , architect , and brother , rabi jacob jehudah leon . `` he drew also more than 200 figures and vignettes to illustrate talmudical subjects , which his son solomon gave to surenhusius for his latin translation of the mishnah .

thomas wright blakiston ( 27 december 1832 – 15 october 1891 ) was an english explorer and naturalist .
born in lymington , hampshire , blakiston was the son of major john blakiston , second son of sir matthew blakiston , 2nd baronet ( see blakiston baronets for earlier history of the family ) . his mother was jane , daughter of reverend thomas wright , rector of market bosworth , leicestershire . blakiston explored western canada with the palliser expedition between 1857 and 1859 . mount blakiston , the highest point in waterton lakes national park was named for him in 1858 . in 1861 he traveled up the yangtze river in china , going further than any westerner before him . he spent the next part of his life in japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country . he moved to the united states in 1885 . blakiston died aged 58 of pneumonia in october 1891 while in san diego , california and is buried in greenlawn cemetery , columbus , ohio .
blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in hokkaidō , japan 's northern island , were related to northern asian species , whereas those on honshū to the south were related to those from southern asia . the tsugaru strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary , and became known as `` blakiston 's line `` .
blakiston collected an owl specimen in hakodate , japan in 1883 . this was later described by henry seebohm and named blakiston 's fish owl .
blakiston married ann mary in 1885 . she was the daughter of james dun and the sister of edwin dun . they had one daughter and one son . ann mary survived him by 46 years and died in england in march 1937 .

karl august möbius ( 7 february 1825 in eilenburg – 26 april 1908 in berlin ) was a german zoologist who was a pioneer in the field of ecology and a former director of the museum für naturkunde in berlin .


== early life ==
möbius was born in eilenburg in saxony . at the age of four he attended primary school at the bergschule eilenburg , and at the age of 12 he was sent by his father to train as a teacher . in 1844 he passed the exams with distinction and began working as teacher in seesen , on the northwest edge of the harz mountain range . in 1849 he began studying natural science and philosophy at natural history museum of berlin . after he graduated , he taught zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , physics , and chemistry at the johanneum high school in hamburg .


== oysters and ecology ==
in 1863 he opened the first german sea water aquarium , in hamburg . in 1868 , shortly after passing his doctoral examination at the university of halle , he was appointed professor of zoology at the university of kiel and the director of the zoological museum . marine animals were among his main research interests and his first comprehensive work on the fauna of the kieler bucht already emphasized ecological aspects ( die fauna der kieler bucht , co-authored by heinrich adolph meyer , and published in two volumes in 1865 and 1872 , respectively ) .
between 1868 and 1870 , möbius was commissioned by the ministry of agricultural affairs in prussia to conduct research on the bay of kiel oyster beds . at the time , the oysters were being gathered from the natural beds and sold at expensive prices to the wealthy elite . once the railroad was constructed and more opportunities for exportation arose , the demand for the oysters grew exponentially . in turn , the ministry tasked möbius with exploring the potential for further exploitation of the beds . möbius 's research resulted in two landmark publications : über austern- und miesmuschelzucht und hebung derselben an der norddeutschen küste ( 1870 , in english : on oyster and blue mussel farming in coastal areas of northern germany ) , and die auster und die austernwirtschaft ( in english : oyster and oyster farming ) , in which he concluded that oyster farming was not a realistic option for northern germany . more importantly , he was first to describe in detail the interactions between the different organisms in the ecosystem of the oyster bank , coining the term `` biocenose `` . this remains a key term in synecology ( community ecology ) .
in 1888 möbius became the director of the zoological collections of the natural history museum of berlin , and professor of systematic and geographical zoology at the kaiser wilhelm university , berlin , where he taught until he retired in 1905 , at the age of 80 .

= friedrich oskar giesel =
friedrich oskar giesel ( 20 may 1852 – 13 november 1927 , known as fritz ) was a german organic chemist . during his work in a quinine factory in the late 1890s he started to work on the at-that-time-new field of radiochemistry and started the production of radium . in the period between 1902 and 1904 he was able to isolate a new element emanium . in a now controversially reviewed process it was stated that emanium is identical to actinium , which was discovered by andré-louis debierne in 1899 .


== life and work ==
after studying in berlin with carl liebermann he received his ph.d at the university of göttingen . giesel worked at the chininfabrik braunschweig . besides his work in the factory , giesel 's focus was on radiochemistry . shortly after publication of the discovery of polonium in the summer of 1898 , he started to isolate the new element from the waste of uranium production in the chemical plant e. de haën in hanover . by march 1899 he could present the first radium to the chemical society of braunschweig and by mid-1899 he published his results on radium . giesel improved the separation of radium from barium by using the bromides instead of the chlorides for the fractional crystallization . he produced large quantities of pure radium and polonium for commercial applications from uranium ore . even william ramsay and frederick soddy were buying radium from the factory of giesel .

what i have since dubbed the isenthal 'manna ' was in fact the first consignment of pure radium compounds that giesel of the chinin fabrik of brunswick was putting on the market and the price i paid for it was about eight shillings a milligram of radium bromide ( 50 per cent pure radium ) .

the use of sidot 's blende ( zinc sulfide ) instead of barium platinocyanide as a luminescence material to make the radioactive rays visible was a commonly accepted improvement . he did several self-experiments with radioactive substances and was able to affirm the damaging effects of radioactive radiation on skin . because of prolonged contact with radioactive material , fingers of his right hand had to be amputated and he suffered from lung cancer . he died of lung cancer in 1927 . his name was included on the monument to the x-ray and radium martyrs of all nations erected in hamburg , germany in 1936 .


=== the discovery of emanium ===
giesel isolated from pitchblende a lanthanum-containing fraction which showed unique properties . he produced several compounds of the new element , and after studying for two years he was confident enough to give the new element the name emanium . he was aware of the discovery of actinium by andré-louis debierne . in publications from 1899 and 1890 debierne does not give the exact procedures to obtain actinium , but from the description of chemical properties which he described as similar to titanium ( 1899 ) or similar to thorium ( 1890 ) it was clear for giesel that the two elements must be different . a later comparison of the two elements by otto hahn , otto sackur and others showed that the two elements were identical . debierne 's name was retained because it had seniority.giesel stated in one of his publications that the sample debierne provided for the comparison was a lanthanum fraction obtained by the same process he used and not the titanium or thorium fractions from earlier publications . this fact never led to an open controversy but the history of the discovery stayed questionable , and publications from 1971 argue that the claims of andré-louis debierne in 1904 conflict with the publications in 1899 and 1890 , making giesel the real discoverer of actinium .
a less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by adloff . he suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the nascent state of radiochemistry , highlights the prudence of debierne 's claims in the original papers , and notes that nobody can contend that debierne 's substance did not contain actinium . debierne , who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer , lost interest in the element and left the topic . giesel , on the other hand , can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89 .

in 1969 bendix was elected president of the american sociological association . from 1968 to 1970 he served as director of the university of california education abroad program in göttingen , germany . in 1972 he joined the department of political science at berkeley .
he held guest professorships at numerous universities , including at columbia university , st. catherine 's and nuffield colleges at the university of oxford , the free university of berlin , the university of constance , hebrew university in jerusalem , and the university of heidelberg .
in the course of his lifetime , he received many honors , including fellowships from the fulbright program and the guggenheim , a grant from the carnegie corporation , as well as being named a fellow at the institute for advanced study , and was accepted into both the woodrow wilson international center for scholars and wissenschaftskolleg zu berlin . he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1969 . bendix was also a member of the american philosophical society and received honorary doctorates from the university of leeds , mannheim , and göttingen .
bendix , who was deeply devoted to teaching , died in 1991 of a heart attack shortly after conducting a graduate seminar together with a young colleague .
reinhard bendix built bridges between american and european sociology , he did regard himself as a mediator . bendix introduced to american sociologists a new perspective , the comparative-historical studies , moving beyond their local boundaries . the constellations of legitimating ideas were not mere reflections of life conditions , or social structure , but independent and real forces . in his terms
americans better understand their own history through its relation to the histories of european nations . the methodological problems raised by such comparisons could inspire him to propose a philosophy of history , but it was not his goal .

she earned her doctorate in physics from the university of vienna in 1917 on `` size determination of submicroscopic particles based on optical and mechanical effects `` . from 1918 to 1919 , she worked as an assistant at the university of göttingen and , in 1920 , as an assistant in the physical institute of the technical university of berlin , where she was introduced to the experimental technique that became her major interest.her early research concerned the bohr model . laski was a student of peter debye , who was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1936 . debye studied the dispersion of light by bohr 's hydrogen model and found that the theoretical curve corresponded satisfactorily to the curve observed . laski later showed agreement between theory and experiment , however based on an erroneous interpretation of data .
laski 's main research focus later on was infrared research . this included the examination of selected chemical substances by means of infrared radiation—a field of application . beginning in 1924 , laski was the director of the infrared department at the institute for fibre chemistry of the kaiser wilhelm society , a department which was closed due to lack of financing . she then became a voluntary assistant at the physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt ( imperial physical-technical institute ) in 1927 , in order to establish an infrared laboratory .
after serious illness , the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics provided laski with a monthly stipend until her death in 1928.her final work was on special methods for infrared measurement and thermoelectricity . her research also included studying natural infrared frequencies of diatomic bohr gas molecules and their specific heat at high temperatures .


== literature ==
laski wrote her thesis on `` size determination of submicroscopic particles based on optical and mechanical effects `` , which was published in 1917 and is 48 pages long . the book is written in german and is part of the holdings of the german national library .

= giambattista nolli =
giambattista nolli ( or giovanni battista ) [ april 9 , 1701 – july 3 , 1756 ] , was an italian architect and surveyor . he is best known for his ichnographic plan of rome , the pianta grande di roma which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748 , and now universally known as the nolli map . the map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measures 176 centimetres ( 69 in ) by 208 centimetres ( 82 in ) and was published in response to the commission of pope benedict xiv to survey rome in order to help create demarcations for the 14 traditional rioni or districts . it was by far the most accurate description of rome produced to date at a time when the architectural achievement of the papacy was in full flower .


== biography ==
born in 1701 in castiglione d'intelvi ( como ) , he moved to rome thanks to the patronage of members of the patrician albani and corsini families .
as an architect , he worked on the churches of sant'alessio on the aventine hill ( 1743 ) and santa dorotea in trastevere ( 1751–1756 ) .


== nolli map ==
the nolli map reflects bufalini 's map of 1551 , with which nolli readily invited comparison , however nolli made a number of important innovations . firstly , nolli reorients the city from east ( which was conventional at the time ) to magnetic north , reflecting nolli 's reliance on the compass to get a bearing on the city 's topography . secondly , though he follows bufalini in using a figure-ground representation of built space with blocks and building shaded in a dark poché , nolli represents enclosed public spaces such as the colonnades in st. peter 's square and the pantheon as open civic spaces . finally , the map was a significant improvement in accuracy , even noting the asymmetry of the spanish steps . the map was used in government planning for the city of rome until the 1970s ; it was used as a base map for all roman mapping and planning up to that date .
the map is framed with a vedute by stefano pozzi . a scaled-down edition , a collaboration between nolli and giovanni battista piranesi , was published in the same year the original map was finished . piranesi was instrumental in getting the work printed ; giuseppe vasi also contributed .

robert bruce merrifield ( july 15 , 1921 – may 14 , 2006 ) was an american biochemist who won the nobel prize in chemistry in 1984 for the invention of solid phase peptide synthesis .


== early life ==
he was born in fort worth , texas , on 15 july 1921 , the only son of george e. merrifield and lorene née lucas . in 1923 the family moved to california where he attended nine grade schools and two high schools before graduating from montebello high school in 1939 . it was there that he developed an interest both in chemistry and in astronomy .
after two years at pasadena junior college he transferred to the university of california at los angeles ( ucla ) . after graduation in chemistry he worked for a year at the philip r. park research foundation taking care of an animal colony and assisting with growth experiments on synthetic amino acid diets . one of these was the experiment by geiger that first demonstrated that the essential amino acids must be present simultaneously for growth to occur .
he returned to graduate school at the ucla chemistry department with professor of biochemistry m.s . dunn to develop microbiological methods for the quantitation of the pyrimidines . the day after graduating on 19 june 1949 , he married elizabeth furlong and the next day left for new york city and the rockefeller institute for medical research .


== career ==
at the institute , later rockefeller university , he worked as an assistant for dr. d.w. woolley on a dinucleotide growth factor he discovered in graduate school and on peptide growth factors that woolley had discovered earlier . these studies led to the need for peptide synthesis and , eventually , to the idea for solid phase peptide synthesis ( spps ) in 1959 . in 1963 , he was sole author of a classic paper in the journal of the american chemical society in which he reported a method he called `` solid phase peptide synthesis `` . this article is the fifth most cited paper in the journal 's history .
in the mid-60s dr. merrifield 's laboratory first synthesized bradykinin , angiotensin , desamino-oxytocin and insulin . in 1969 , he and his colleague bernd gutte announced the first synthesis of the enzyme , ribonuclease a . this work proved the chemical nature of enzymes .
dr. merrifield 's method greatly stimulated progress in biochemistry , pharmacology and medicine , making possible the systematic exploration of the structural basis of the activities of enzymes , hormones and antibodies . the development and applications of the technique continued to occupy his laboratory , where he remained active at the bench until recently . in 1993 , he published his autobiography , `` life during a golden age of peptide chemistry . `` he received the association of biomolecular resource facilities award for outstanding contributions to biomolecular technologies in 1998 .
the achievement of synthesizing ribonuclease a ( with bernd gutte ) was all the more significant in that it demonstrated that the linear sequence of amino acids joined in peptide bonds determined directly the tertiary structure of a peptide or protein . i.e . that information coded in one dimension can directly determine the three-dimensional structure of a molecule .
spps has been expanded to include solid phase synthesis of nucleotides and saccharides .


== personal life ==
after raising their 6 children , james , nancy , betsy , cathy , laurie and sally , his wife elizabeth ( libby ) , a biologist by training , joined the merrifield laboratory at rockefeller university where she worked for over 23 years .
after a long illness r. bruce merrifield died on may 14 , 2006 at the age of 84 in his home in cresskill , new jersey . he is survived by his wife , children and 16 grandchildren .

alexander oscar gettler ( august 13 , 1883 – august 4 , 1968 ) was a toxicologist with the office of chief medical examiner of the city of new york ( ocme ) between 1918 and 1959 , and the first forensic chemist to be employed in this capacity by a u.s. city . his work at ocme with charles norris , the chief medical examiner , created the foundation for modern medicolegal investigation in the u.s. and gettler has been described by peers as `` the father of forensic toxicology in america . `` the alexander o. gettler award is a prize established in his name by the american academy of forensic sciences .


== early life and education ==
gettler was born jewish in galicia , poland , a part of the empire of austria-hungary in 1883 . as oscar gettler , aged seven , he emigrated to the u.s. with his father , joseph gettler , and sister , elise , on board the red star line steamer , westernland , which arrived at the port of new york on may 6 , 1891 ; they settled in brooklyn , where he was raised . he studied at the city college of new york and in 1912 received his phd in biochemistry from columbia university . prior to his employment with ocme he worked as a clinical chemist at the bellevue hospital in manhattan and taught biochemistry at the new york university school of medicine . he married alice gorman in 1912 .


== toxicology work ==
charles norris established the ocme in 1918 and set up his first offices in the pathology building ( the 'city morgue ' ) of bellevue hospital . while there he asked gettler if he would be willing to conduct any chemical testing that might be required to which gettler agreed . an ocme laboratory , where testing was carried out for the presence of the common poisons , was set up on the third floor of the city morgue building on first avenue and 29th street.gettler often had to create new tests to isolate poisons . he regularly experimented by poisoning raw liver and attempting to isolate ever-smaller amounts of poison from it . these tests often involved mashing or liquifying tissue , followed by such tests as crystal formation , melting and boiling point analysis , color reactions , and titration . in 1935 , gettler was the first scientist to use a spectrometer in a criminal investigation in order to prove that the thallium that had poisoned the four children of brooklyn bookkeeper frederick gross did not come from cocoa powder gross had brought home from work . a previous chemical test had mistaken copper contamination from the box for thallium leading to gross 's arrest . the examiners eventually concluded that his wife had murdered the children before dying herself of encephalitis.gettler often had to work for low pay , due to severe budget cuts to the toxicology office . in addition to this , gettler also wrote numerous papers on isolating poisons such as benzene from human bodies .


== teaching ==
in the 1920s , gettler took the post of professor of chemistry at washington square college of new york university . at the same time he held a post at the new york university graduate school . there , gettler established a toxicology course in 1935 . he retired from teaching in 1948 , when he reached the mandatory retirement age .


== later life and death ==
gettler retired from the office of the medical examiner on january 1 , 1959 , when he was 75 . he remained interested in toxicology until he died due to a terminal illness approximately ten years after retiring .

william nicholson ( 13 december 1753 – 21 may 1815 ) was a renowned english chemist and writer on `` natural philosophy `` and chemistry , as well as a translator , journalist , publisher , scientist , inventor , patent agent and civil engineer .


== early life ==
nicholson was educated in yorkshire , and after leaving school , he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the british east india company . his first ship was reportedly called the boston and the second voyage was on board the gatton .
subsequently , having become acquainted with josiah wedgwood in 1775 , he moved to amsterdam , where he made a living for a few years as wedgwood 's agent .
on his return to england he was persuaded by thomas holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals , while also assisting holcroft with some of his plays and novels . meanwhile , he devoted himself to the preparation of an introduction to natural philosophy , which was published in 1781 and was at once successful . a translation of voltaire 's elements of the newtonian philosophy soon followed , and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism .
in 1784 he was proposed by josiah wedgwood ( the current chairman ) and appointed as secretary to the general chamber of manufacturers of great britain , and he was also connected with the society for the encouragement of naval architecture , established in 1791 . he gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting , file-making , cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an areometer .


== scientific work ==
on 12 december 1783 , nicholson was elected to the `` chapter coffee house philosophical society `` . he was proposed by jean-hyacinthe magellan and seconded by horologist john whitehurst.nicholson communicated to the royal society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects . in the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over richard kirwan 's essay on phlogiston , and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the french academicians ( lavoisier , monge , berthollet , and guyton de morveau ) as ‘ an essay on phlogiston , to which are added notes . ’ in 1797 he founded , published , and wrote part of the journal of natural philosophy , chemistry and the arts , generally known as nicholson 's journal , the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in great britain . the journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs , by george cayley in 1809-1810 . the publication continued until 1814 .
in 1799 he established a school in london 's soho square , where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry , with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from thomas pitt .
in may 1800 he with anthony carlisle discovered electrolysis , the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current . the two were then appointed to a chemical investigation committee of the new royal institution . but his own interests shortly turned elsewhere.besides considerable contributions to the philosophical transactions , nicholson wrote translations of fourcroy 's chemistry ( 1787 ) and chaptal 's chemistry ( 1788 ) , first principles of chemistry ( 1788 ) and a chemical dictionary ( 1795 ) ; he also edited the british encyclopedia , or dictionary of arts and sciences ( 6 vols . , london , 1809 ) .


== later life ==
during the later years of his life , nicholson 's attention was chiefly directed to water supply engineering at portsmouth , at gosport and in hammersmith . william nicholson died in bloomsbury at the age of 61 on 21 may 1815 , attended by sir anthony carlisle .

in june 1783 , blagden , then assistant to henry cavendish , visited antoine lavoisier in paris and described how cavendish had created water by burning `` inflammable air `` . lavoisier 's dissatisfaction with the cavendish 's `` dephlogistinization `` theory led him to the concept of a chemical reaction , which he reported to the royal academy of sciences on 24 june 1783 , effectively founding modern chemistry . he was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1789.blagden experimented on human ability to withstand high temperatures . in his report to the royal society in 1775 , he was first to recognise the role of perspiration in thermoregulation.blagden 's experiments on how dissolved substances like salt affected the freezing point of water led to the discovery that the freezing point of a solution decreases in direct proportion to the concentration of the solution , now called blagden 's law .

= ilona durigo =
ilona durigo ( 13 may 1881 – 25 december 1943 ) was a hungarian classical contralto and an academic voice teacher . she appeared internationally , mostly in concert , singing lieder and oratorios . she is known for singing lieder that othmar schoeck composed for her , and is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of her era .


== life ==
born in budapest on 13 may 1881 , durigo was a pupil of bianca malezcky and julius stockhausen . she studied from 1902 at the vienna conservatory with philipp forstén , then took further studies with etelka gerster and eduard bellwidt in berlin.each year from 1930 to 1939 she performed the alto part in bach 's st. matthew passion with the concertgebouw orchestra , conducted by willem mengelberg . this included the first recording of the work in 1939 , alongside karl erb as the evangelist and willem ravelli as the vox christi . she performed as a soloist in more than 40 concerts with the choir der gemischte chor zürich between 1911 and 1943 . singing also in musical centres of austria , germany , belgium and italy , she is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of the period.in 1912 , durigo first performed with othmar schoeck , and in 1913 she entered his social circle and they became friends . durigo fell in love with schoeck , but her feelings were not returned , and in any event she was by then married to the hungarian pianist osman kasics . her relationship with schoeck was at times turbulent , but durigo soon became the best-known interpreter of his work , and in later life he stated that she was the finest singer of his songs he had found .
her many collaborations with schoeck included his settings of poems by hesse . the reviewer of her recital in bern on 23 march 1915 , with schoeck as the pianist , in the berner tagblatt praised her differentiated expression of emotions and the accord with the pianist : `` frau durigo sang diese und alle anderen lieder ( mit der zugabe waren es 19 ) ... mit tiefster empfindung . ihr eigenes erleben dieser lieder äusserte sich nicht allein in den musikalischen vortragsdifferenzierungen ( so wunderzart , poesieverklärte töne , wie die ihres kopfregisters , hörte man vorher von keiner sängerin ) , sondern auch im zu- und abnehmenden glanz ihrer augen , dieses wahren seelenspiegels . und dass ihre interpretation durchwegs das vom komponisten empfundene zutreffend erfasste , bewies die vollkommene harmonie ihres herrlichen gesanges mit schoecks eigenartig schönem klavierspiel . `` frau durigo sang these and all other songs ( with those added there were nineteen ) ... with the deepest sensitivity . her own experience of the songs shone through , not only in the musical differences of enunciation ( such wonderfully fine , such poetry-transfigured tones of the head−voice were never heard before from any singer ) , but also in the sparkle of her eyes , the true mirror of the soul , as it came and went . and the perfect harmony between her splendid singing and the exceptionally beautiful piano playing of schoeck showed that her interpretation throughout captured the intentions of the composer .

durigo was a voice teacher at the zurich conservatory from 1921 to 1937 , where one of her students was maria stader . she was a friend of hermann hesse , the composer and conductor fritz brun , and the violinist alphonse brun.durigo returned to budapest in 1937 and taught at the liszt conservatory . she died on 25 december 1943 .

carl snyder ( april 23 , 1869 , cedar falls ia – 1946 santa barbara ca ) was an american economist and statistician .
although he attended the university of iowa and studied in paris , he was chiefly self-taught . he began as a journalist ; at the age of 20 , he was editor of the council bluffs nonparell , later writing editorials for the washington post . snyder was also something of a science writer , authoring popular articles in magazines such as mcclure 's and the fortnightly review about , for example , jacques loeb 's experiments on the nature of living tissue . he was a president of the american statistical association , a fellow of the american association for advancement of science and of the american academy of arts and letters , and a member of the institut internationale de statistique .
in the 1910s and 20s , snyder was employed as a statistician in the research department of the federal reserve bank of new york , under benjamin strong . the two men clashed , but still respected each other . during these years , he lectured at american universities and contributed to economic and statistical journals .
snyder 's response to the great depression was to write his magnum opus capitalism the creator ( 1940 ) . the book , written in an eccentric prose style replete with fragmentary sentences , is part classical liberal manifesto , part elucubration of an enthusiastic statistical autodidact . it blamed the depression on the fed 's failure to stabilize the money stock and the price level . the book provided inspiration to such figures as ayn rand and friedrich von hayek .

in today 's language , scheffers ' qss has the quaternion algebra as a subalgebra .
scheffers anticipates the concepts of direct product of algebras and direct sum of algebras with his section ( p 317 ) on reducibility , addition , and multiplication of systems .
thus scheffers pioneered the structural approach to algebra .
though the article covers new ground with its exploration of nqss , it is also a literature review going back to the work of hermann hankel . in §14 ( p 386 ) scheffers reviews both german and english authors on hypercomplex numbers . in particular , he cites eduard study ’ s work of 1889 . for volume 41 of mathematische annalen scheffers contributed a further short note , this time including reference to 1867 work by edmond laguerre on linear systems , a rich source of hypercomplex numbers .

paul wilhelm gustav weyland ( 20 january 1888 , berlin – 6 december 1972 , bad pyrmont ) was the anti-semitic leader of the anti einstein league.in 1919 weyland published the novel hie kreuz - hie triglaff ( the cross against the triglav ) , which gives a chauvinistic account of the historical events of the tenth century a.d. in pomerania . it ends with an open allusion to the contemporary conflicts between germans and poles in upper silesia . a second book der tanz als kulturelles ausdrucksmittel ( dancing as an expression of culture ) was promised , with a chapter on modern dance as a sign of cultural decline . however this book never appeared and weyland was to move on to scientific theory.weyland was a key figure involved in organising an anti-semitic campaign against relativity . in august 1920 he organised a mass meeting at the berliner philharmonie to contest einstein 's theory of relativity . after ensuring the meeting had been well-advertised in the newspapers , weyland delivered a vituperative attack on einstein , described as `` with heavy artillery `` in one newspaper . this attack consisted primarily of unsubstantial insults against the theory of relativity alongside claims that it was promoted by a `` the clique of [ einstein 's ] academic supporters `` . weyland claimed that the theory constituted a form of hypnotic mass suggestion and jewish arrogance , which was a product of an unsettling spiritually chaotic period and that it amongst other repellent ideas it was poisoning of german thought . it was this speech which culminated in the statement : `` relativity theory is scientific dadaism `` .he was later granted american citizenship .

= alfred potier =
alfred potier ( 11 may 1840 , in paris – 8 may 1905 , in paris ) was a french polymath who contributed to many theoretical and practical fields of science when this was rapidly expanding . his interests covered mainly mathematical physics , the nature of light and the ether , geology , electricity and magnetism and their practical applications in industry . his name ’ s claim to fame rests , however , on a little explored footnote inserted by michelson and morley in their famous paper “ on the relative motion of the earth and the luminiferous ether ” .


== biography ==
born in 1840 , potier entered the école polytechnique at age 17 , where in 1867 he became a physics teacher , and then in 1881 full professor of physics , succeeding jamin and preceding nobel laureate henri becquerel . at the same time , he was member of the state mining engineers corps , occupying the chair of physics in the école des mines where he taught henri poincaré . geological works included revisions of the geological map of france and submarine topographies in pas-de-calais in order to examine the feasibility of a tunnel to england . these , and his valor during the german siege of paris in 1870 , earned him the légion d'honneur . his other publications concerned fresnel ’ s theories of light and the ether , diffraction of polarized light , elliptical reflection , magnetic rotational forces , or interference fringes . he contributed extensive notes to jc maxwell ’ s treatise on electromagnetism , facilitating its reading in france .
potier was a member of many committees at the famous 1881 universal exposition in paris , including the one that set the standards for units in electricity . the french physics society appointed potier as president in 1884 ; the international electricians society did the same in 1895 . in 1891 he was accepted into the french academy of science .


== speed of light ==
following thomas young ’ s ideas , light was regarded in the 19th century to move as vibrations ( undulations ) in a substance called the luminiferous aether , contrary to newton ’ s ideas that light itself was made of substantive corpuscles . exploring the nature of this aether , albert michelson published in 1881 his laboratory experiments where he had light travel in the direction of the earth ’ s motion and perpendicular to it . thus measured on the moving earth , he found no difference in the speed of light traveling with the earth or perpendicular to it . it would have fully conformed to rules prevailing in a galilean invariance system of coordinates , also called newtonian inertial system , which apply to moving material particles .
in the 1887 paper , written with edward morley , michelson amended the route of the perpendicular light from ab1 to ab : “ it may be mentioned here that the error was pointed out to the author of the former paper by m.a . potier , of paris , in the winter of 1881 . ” when the instrument on the moving earth is observed from a stationary point outside earth , the mirror at b1 already moved to b while light was traveling there from a . “ this meant that michelson had overestimated by a factor of two the fringe shifts originally expected . ” the mirror at c also moved forward at the same time , but this was not taken into account . it thus seemed that light traveled different distances at the same time , which led george fitzgerald and hendrik lorentz ( lorentz ether theory ) to postulate that distances shortened and time dilated in direction of motion ( fitzgerald-lorentz contraction ) .

even though he was trained as an engineer , van wijngaarden would emphasize and promote the mathematical aspects of computing , first in numerical analysis , then in programming languages and finally in design principles of programming languages .


== biography ==
his education was in mechanical engineering , for which he received a degree from delft university of technology in 1939 . he then studied for a doctorate in hydrodynamics , but abandoned the area . he joined the nationaal luchtvaartlaboratorium in 1945 and went with a group to england the following year to learn about new technologies that had been developed there during world war ii .
van wijngaarden was intrigued by the new idea of automatic computing , and on 1 january 1947 he became the head of the computing department of the brand-new mathematisch centrum ( mc ) in amsterdam . he then made further visits to england and the united states , gathering ideas for the construction of the first dutch computer , the arra , an electromechanical construction first demonstrated in 1952 . in that same year , van wijngaarden hired edsger dijkstra , and they worked on software for the arra .
while visiting edinburgh in 1958 , van wijngaarden was seriously injured in an automobile accident in which his wife was killed . after he recovered , he focused more on programming language research , and was one of the designers of the original algol , and later algol 68 , for which he developed a two-level type of grammar that became known as van wijngaarden grammars . he became the director of the mc in 1961 , and remained in that post for the next twenty years .

= honor c3 a9 langl c3 a9 =
honoré françois marie langlé ( 1741–1807 ) was a french theorist of music of monegasque origin , composer , and author of a traité d'harmonie et de modulation ( paris : boyer , 1795 ) . napoleon named him to the newly founded paris conservatoire.born to a family originally from picardy that was established at monaco in the 18th century , langlé showed so much early promise in music that honoré iii of monaco sent him with an endowment to naples at the age of fifteen . there he studied harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorio della pietà dei turchini under the direction of pasquale cafaro . he remained for more than eight years , composing masses and motets that gained him a sufficient reputation in italy that he was appointed to direct the city theatre of genoa .
in 1768 , langlé left for france . in paris he supported himself by giving harpsichord and singing lessons and taught musical composition to private pupils , while he gained a reputation through participating in anne danican philidor 's concerts spirituels , the most prominent venue for secular concert music in paris . there several of his compositions premiered successfully , including a sung monologue , alcide and a cantata circé .
in the following decade his reputation spread from the parisian musical world of versailles , where as langlois , the spelling preferred by his son and grandson , he gave clavecin and fortepiano lessons to queen marie antoinette . when the baron de breteuil formed the école royale de chant et de déclamations in 1784 , langlé was entrusted with teaching singing , a position he retained until the institutional changes that came with the french revolution . with the creation of the paris conservatoire in 1795 , langlé was instituted as librarian , a place he held until 1802 .
his theoretical traité d'harmonie et de modulation was published at paris in 1795 .
his success in the field of opera was less than secure . in 1786 his opera
antiochus et stratonice failed to please at versailles . five years later , during the revolution , his three-act opera corisandre , presented at the académie de musique , sank without a trace . undeterred , though unable to get them publicly mounted , langlé continued to compose operas in private for the rest of hid life . his songs achieved more success : his `` hymne à bara et à viala `` ( 1794 ) continued to be taught in music schools through the 19th century .
in retirement towards the end of his life at his property , villiers le bel , langlé devoted himself passionately to gardening . his posthumous reputation has supported françois-joseph fétis , who found his music lacked qualities of genius , but his traité d ’ harmonie et de modulation long remained a staple in academic teaching .

= gustaf bj c3 b6rnram =
gustaf björnram ( 1746-1804 ) was a swedish mystic and spiritualist medium.he was born in savolax as the son of the lieutenant per björnram ( 1700–1766 ) and anna margareta amnorin . he was a student of the åbo university and moved to stockholm where he became a private teacher and a secretary . through his work as a writer for the freemasons he came in to contact with elis schröderheim , who introduced him to king gustav iii of sweden .
gustaf björnram claimed to be able to communicate with the spirits of the dead and arranged well-attended séances frequented by the king and prince charles , during which he allegedly forwarded predictions about the future from the dead . for a couple of years around 1780 , he was an immensely fashionable medium in stockholm , was inducted into the freemasons and given a sinecure by the monarch . he once performed a séance in the church of lovö , where he called upon the spirit of adolf frederick , king of sweden in the presence of the king and a circle of his favorites , among them adolf fredrik munck , where the father of the king appeared as a mask behind a curtain of smoke in the dark church .
however , when his prediction about the death of the king 's mother , which was eagerly awaited by the king , did not materialize , and the royal physician sven anders hedin exposed him as a fraud by describing how he had witnessed his preparations for the so-called seance in the lovö church , he lost his favor with the king , who gave him a pension and dismissed him from court . he was replaced by henrik gustaf ulfvenklou .

= hendrik s. houthakker =
hendrik samuel houthakker ( december 31 , 1924 – april 15 , 2008 ) was a prominent american economist .


== life and career ==
houthakker was born in amsterdam . his father was a prominent art dealer . as a teenager he lived through the nazi occupation of the netherlands and , according to an interview he gave to the valley news , was once arrested by the gestapo but escaped and was sheltered for some months by a roman catholic family . he completed his graduate work at the university of amsterdam in 1949 . he taught at stanford university from 1954 to 1960 and then completed the rest of his career at harvard university . in 1961 he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association . houthakker served on president nixon 's council of economic advisers from 1969 to 1971 , where he advocated replacing the international monetary fund 's pegged exchange rate system with a flexible peg .
houthakker 's contributions to economic theory have been summarized by pollak ( 1990 ) . he is particularly well known for the strong axiom of revealed preference , to which his name is often attached . this paper reconciles paul samuelson 's revealed preference approach to demand theory with the earlier ordinal utility approach of eugene slutsky and sir john hicks , by showing that demand functions satisfy his strong axiom if and only if they can be generated by maximising a set of preferences that are `` well-behaved `` in the sense that they satisfy the axioms of choice theory , that is , they are reflexive , transitive , complete , monotonic , convex and continuous—essentially the conditions required for a hicksian approach to demand theory .
houthakker 's wife , anna-teresa tymieniecka , was a polish-born philosopher and founder of the world phenomenology institute ; they were married for 52 years , up to his death . through her he became friendly with karol wojtyła , subsequently pope john paul ii .
barack obama sr. ( barack obama 's father ) worked as a research assistant for houthakker over the summer in 1963 at harvard .

= keith millis =
keith dwight millis ( may 20 , 1915 – july 6 , 1992 ) was an american metallurgical engineer and inventor of ductile iron.keith millis grew up in rensselaer , new york and earned his bachelor of science in metallurgical engineering as a 1938 graduate of rensselaer polytechnic institute . a year later he was conferred a master of science degree in metallurgical engineering at rpi .
early in the second world war , chromium was considered critical to the war effort and experimentation was conducted by millis to find a substitute . he made his discovery while experimenting with molten iron and magnesium . the original intent was to find another element that would cause all the carbon in the cast iron alloy to be combined as carbide . magnesium was a known carbide former . instead , the graphite in the iron formed into spheroidal shapes , and the cast iron had high tensile strength plus it exhibited ductility . thus was born ductile iron in 1943 .
millis and others at the international nickel company ( inco ) sought and obtained u.s. patent 2,485,760 on october 25 , 1949 for magnesium additions to cast iron that would spheroidize the graphite and dramatically ductilize the material.as an employee of inco , millis worked to promote the use of ductile iron as it began to be used as a commercial material . he also helped to found the ductile iron society , an organization whose purpose is to promote the production and application of ductile iron castings .
millis died in 1992 .


== legacy ==
since his death , the ductile iron society has held the `` keith millis world symposium on ductile iron `` , a technical meeting concerning all facets of ductile iron material , processing and applications . the event has been held approximately every 5 years :

1993 - hilton head island , sc
1998 - hilton head island , sc
2003 - hilton head island , sc
2008 - las vegas , nv
2013 - nashville , tnthe most recent symposium was co-sponsored by the american foundry society . he was inducted into rpi 's alumni hall of fame in 1999 . a perpetual international scholarship has been awarded by the ductile iron society foundry educational foundation in millis 's name since 1991 .

== life ==
when twenty-two years old he entered the novitiate of the society of jesus at cologne where six years later ( 1567 ) he became master of novices . in addition to this office he was appointed to give religious instruction to the upper classes in the jesuit college at cologne .
in 1671 busée left cologne and went to vienna , where he lectured on scripture in the university and taught hebrew at the jesuit college . in 1584 busée went to rome at the directive of the general of the society , claudio acquaviva , who had appointed him a member of a commission to draw up a system or plan of studies ( ratio studiorum ) for the entire society . on his return to vienna , busée was made rector of the college of nobles and died while holding this position .

he undertook to complete the large catechism of peter canisius by adding to it the full text of the scriptural and patristic references cited by the author . peter canisius himself encouraged this undertaking . the first volume appeared at cologne in 1569 , under the title authoritates sacræ scripturæ et sanctorum patrum , quæ in summa doctrinæ christianæ doctoris petri canisii citantur .
the following year , 1570 , the work was completed , and was received at once with much favor . it consists of four volumes ; for some unknown reason the last volume is lacking in the edition of the catechism , with notes by busée , which was issued in 1571 by the house of manutius of venice , the descendants of aldus manutius . in 1577 , a new edition , revised and augmented by another jesuit , jean hase , was published at cologne in one folio volume , under another title : opus catechisticum ... d. petri canisii theologi s.j . præclaris divinæ scripturæ testimoniis , sanctorumque patrum sententiis sedulo illustratum operâ d. petri busæi noviomagni , ejusd . soc . theologi , nunc vero primum accessione novâ locupletatem atque restitutum .

benjamin gompertz ( 5 march 1779 – 14 july 1865 ) was a british self-educated mathematician and actuary , who became a fellow of the royal society . gompertz is now best known for his gompertz law of mortality , a demographic model published in 1825 .


== life ==
of the german jewish family of gompertz of emmerich , he was born in london , where his father and grandfather had been successful diamond merchants . debarred , as a jew , from a university education , he studied on his own from an early age , in the writings of isaac newton , colin maclaurin , and william emerson . from 1798 he was a prominent contributor to the gentleman 's mathematical companion , and for a period won the annual prizes in the magazine for the solutions of problems.in line with his father 's wishes , he entered the london stock exchange . he became a member of the mathematical society of spitalfields , and served as its president when it was merged with the astronomical society of london . in 1819 he was elected a f.r.s . , and in 1832 became a member of the council . the astronomical society was founded in 1820 , and he was elected a member of the council in 1821.on the death of his only son he retired from the stock exchange , and absorbed himself in mathematics . when the guardian insurance office was established in 1821 , he was a candidate for the actuaryship , but the directors objected to him on the grounds that he was a jew . his brother-in-law sir moses montefiore with his relative nathan mayer rothschild then founded the alliance assurance company ( 1824 ) , and gompertz was appointed actuary under the deed of settlement . his management of the alliance company was successful , he was consulted by government , and made computations for the army medical board.in 1848 he retired from active work and returned to his scientific labours . he was a member of many learned societies , and was also one of the promoters of the society for the diffusion of useful knowledge . of the leading jewish charities he was a prominent member , and he worked out a plan of poor relief ( jewish chronicle , 6 october 1845 ) , which was afterwards adopted by the jewish board of guardians.gompertz died from a paralytic seizure on 14 july 1865 .


== works ==

mathematicsfrom 1806 he was a frequent contributor to the philosophical transactions of the royal society ; but his early tracts on complex numbers and porisms ( 1817–18 ) were self-published . gompertz was an old-fashioned newtonian who retained and defended the notation of fluxions .
astronomyfor ten years he actively participated in the work of the astronomical society , contributing papers on the theory of astronomical instruments , the aberration of light , the differential sextant , and the convertible pendulum . with francis baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars ; the work was left uncompleted , because of the publication of the fundamenta astronomiæ of friedrich bessel . their efforts , however , led to the complete catalogue of stars of the royal astronomical society .
the gompertz modelhe worked out a new series of tables of mortality for the royal society , and these suggested to him in 1825 his law of human mortality , which he first expounded in a letter to francis baily . the law rests on an a priori assumption that a person 's resistance to death decreases as his years increase . the model can be written in this way :

= r. a. stewart macalister =
robert alexander stewart macalister ( 8 july 1870 – 26 april 1950 ) was an irish archaeologist .


== biographical notes ==
macalister was born in dublin , ireland , the son of alexander macalister , then professor of professor of zoology , university of dublin . his father was appointed professor of anatomy at cambridge in 1883 , and he was educated at the perse school , and then studied at cambridge university .
although his earliest interest was in the archaeology of ireland , he soon developed a strong interest in biblical archaeology . along with frederick j. bliss , he excavated several towns in the shephelah region of ottoman palestine from 1898 to 1900 . using advances in stratigraphy building on the work of flinders petrie , they developed a chronology for the region using ceramic typology . upon bliss ' retirement , macalister became director of excavations for the palestine exploration fund ( pef ) in 1901 .

from 1902 to 1909 he was responsible for the excavations at gezer , in the modern state of israel , just west of jerusalem . this was one of the earliest large-scale scientific archaeological excavations in the region . the gezer calendar found there is a very early paleo-hebrew calendrical inscription . however , in most respects macalister 's work in biblical archaeology is considered to have been a failure , due to the poor quality of his excavation techniques and his shoddy record-keeping . because macalister was the only professional archaeologist involved in the excavation , managing a project of such complexity was essentially an impossible task .
macalister left the field of biblical archaeology in 1909 to accept a position as professor of celtic archaeology at university college , dublin , where he taught until his retirement in 1943 . during this period , he worked at the ancient irish royal site at the hill of tara and was responsible for editing the catalogue of all known ogham inscriptions from great britain and ireland . many of his translations of irish myths and legends are still widely used today . he was elected to the royal irish academy in 1910 and served as their president from 1926 to 1931 . he was also president of the royal society of antiquaries of ireland from 1924 to 1928 .
he is buried at the parish of the ascension burial ground in cambridge , with his wife margaret a. m. macalister .

== early life ==
according to steve johnson , described at http : //www.jamminpower.com/main/noise.html :
`` john bertrand johnson was a cousin of my father , dr. john a. johnson . bert was born to my grandfather 's sister , who never married , in sweden . bert had no schooling in sweden and lived in extreme poverty . my grandfather sent for him as a teenager and he ended up on their farm in far northwestern north dakota [ usa ] . my grandfather sent bert to school and he finally graduated from high school and went on get his phd in physics from princeton . i was told that he worked with einstein when he was at princeton and went on to be director of bell labs ... i met bert several times , but i was fairly young and most of the family history is lost .. i am in the process of trying to piece together more details `` .
according to the ieee biography entry in , johnson was born in the carl johan parish of goteborg , sweden and christened on october 7 , 1887 . his birth certificate only recorded his mother 's name ( augusta mathilda johansdotter 9b . 1866 ) and his surname is thus derived from his assumed father carl bertrand johnson . he emigrated to the us in 1904 and attended yale . johnson became a us citizen in 1928 . in 1919 he married clara louisa conger ( d.1961 ) and in 1961 he married ruth marie severtson bowden . he had two sons by his first marriage , bertrand conger and alan william . john bertrand johnson died aged 83 in orange , nj , usa , on november 27 , 1970 .


== career ==
in 1928 , while at bell telephone laboratories he published the journal paper `` thermal agitation of electricity in conductors `` . in electronic systems , thermal noise ( now also called johnson noise ) is the noise generated by thermal agitation of electrons in a conductor . johnson 's papers showed a statistical fluctuation of electric charge occur in all electrical conductors , producing random variation of potential between the conductor ends ( such as in vacuum tube amplifiers and thermocouples ) . thermal noise power , per hertz , is equal throughout the frequency spectrum . johnson deduced that thermal noise is intrinsic to all resistors and is not a sign of poor design or manufacture , although resistors may also have excess noise .


== field-effect transistor ==
johnson was possibly among the first people to make a working field effect transistor , based on julius edgar lilienfeld 's us patent 1,900,018 of 1928 . in sworn testimony to the u.s. patent office in 1949 , johnson reported `` ... although the modulation index of 11 per cent is not great , ... the useful output power is substantial ... it is in principle operative as an amplifier `` . on the other hand , in an article in 1964 he denied the operability of lilienfeld 's patent , saying `` i tried conscientiously to reproduce lilienfeld ’ s structure according to his specification and could observe no amplification or even modulation . ``

that zeus was a king in moses ' time .
that tubal of ancient spain may have built stonehenge .

= wilhelm olbers focke =
wilhelm olbers focke ( 5 april 1834 , bremen – 29 september 1922 , bremen ) was a medical doctor and botanist who in 1881 published a significant work on plant breeding entitled die pflanzen-mischlinge , ein beitrag zur biologie der gewächse ( the plant hybrids , a contribution to the biology of plants ) which briefly mentioned gregor mendel 's discoveries on hybridization . although charles darwin had a copy of focke 's book he passed it along to a colleague apparently without reading this particular section . the rediscovery of mendel 's work is generally considered to have taken place in the first years of the 20th century , however in die pflanzen-mischlinge , mendel is mentioned about 18 times - although focke did not apparently take mendel 's work all that seriously . along with hybridization , focke analyzed the non-mendelian phenomena of graft hybrids , pseudogamy , and xenia .
in 1889 focke conducted an inquiry into the former occurrence of malaria in northern germany . he also did much of the work throughout his life on the taxonomy of rubus ( rosaceae ) and published several studies ( 1877-1914 ) . he wrote a number of section monographs for adolf engler and karl anton eugen prantl eds . die natürlichen pflanzenfamilien in the family rosaceae , notably regarding fruit-bearing plants of that family .
much of his other output was published in the bremen periodical : abhandlungen : naturwissenschaftlicher verein zu bremen , a complete list of the published papers in this periodical is available . on examining the focke entries on this list of articles , one can appreciate the wide range of subjects that he studied as well as the industry with which he applied himself to his work .

paul pfurtscheller ( 20 november 1855 salzburg - 5 february 1927 ) was an austrian zoologist and natural history artist who produced a series of 'zoologischen wandtafeln ' ( zoological wall charts ) from 1902 onwards . such charts were initially used only in german-speaking countries , but their use soon became common elsewhere .
pfurtscheller finished his schooling in 1874 , and enrolled at the university of vienna . in 1879 he was awarded a phd degree and licensed to teach science . the next six years saw him teaching at the franz-josef gymnasium , and then for three more years at a high school in vienna . he then returned to the franz-josef gymnasium , remaining there until his retirement in january 1911 . from 1877 he was a member of the zoological and botanical society .
although he received no formal art training , he created the wall charts to illustrate his teaching lessons , and these were later used by the university zoological institute and highly regarded by eminent zoologists . he completed 38 plates and work on the 39th , which showed a dissection of the oriental cockroach , was halted by his death , but was later completed .
the charts were originally published by ' a . pichler 's witwe & sohn und buchhandlung lehrmittelanstalt ' , a bookstore specialising in educational literature and teaching aids in vienna and leipzig . sold individually , they were often varnished , resulting in a yellowish appearance with ageing . the first five charts went on sale in 1902 , and some 70 in total were planned . the charts were last listed in a martinus nijhoff catalogue in 1953 .

campegius vitringa sr. , or kempe vitringa ( born at leeuwarden , may 16 , 1659 ; died at franeker , march 31 , 1722 ) was a dutch protestant theologian and hebraist . his youngest of four children was campeius vitringa ( 1693-1723 ) .
vitringa , a follower of johannes cocceius , was a supporter of prophetic theology . he was educated at the universities of franeker and leiden , and became professor of oriental languages at the former in 1681 . when locating prophetic outcomes , he would associate events to the near rather than the far-off future , placing a distinct focus on the period of the maccabees ( 2nd century bc ) . like joseph mede ( 1586-1638 ) , vitringa believed wholeheartedly that the millennium was yet to come , but did not expect any immediate changes . he relegated the end of the time to a remote future and strongly emphasized the concept of new jerusalem . his most important student is considered herman venema ( 1697-1787 ) , who was a theology professor at franeker.vitringa ’ s two chief works are his dissertation on the synagogue , de synagoga vetere libri tres ( franeker , 1685 ; 2d ed . 1696 ) ; and his commentary on isaiah ( leeuwarden , 1714–20 ) , which was frequently republished in the eighteenth century . the latter was up to the time of gesenius the most considerable contribution to the exegesis of isaiah . his other works include , sacrarum observationum libri sex ( franeker , 1683-1708 ) and anacrisis apocalypseos joannis apostoli ( 1705 ) .


== anacrisis apocalypseos ==

vitringa ’ s most notable work was anacrisis apocalypseos joannis apostoli ( 1705 ) , which was considered a major event , in the history of prophetic theology at the turn of the 18th century . he drew extensively on the clavis apocalyptica ( 1627 ) , by joseph mede ( 1586-1638 ) . vitringa ’ s work was regarded the first major study to analyze the book of revelation as a structured chronological outline of the history of the christian church . his interpretation of the apocalypse was that of a coded description of the history of the new testament church . though vitringa had integrated the historical method of hugo grotius in past work , he rejected the view of grotius and bossuet that associated john ’ s visions exclusively to early christendom .

= arthur a. meyerhoff =
arthur e. meyerhoff ( 1895–1986 ) was an advertising agency executive and entrepreneur . he was born in chicago , illinois .
meyerhoff founded his own agency , arthur meyerhoff associates , in 1932 after persuading the wm . wrigley jr. company that he could arrange for newspapers to place advertisements for wrigley chewing gum on their comic pages . he then got the newspapers to agree to the idea .


== biography ==
during world war ii , philip k. wrigley was in charge both of the wrigley company and the chicago cubs major league baseball club . wrigley decided to found the all-american girls professional baseball league as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major league rosters of first-line players . he approached other major league team owners , but the idea was not well received . then , four non-major league cities were selected that were in close proximity to the aagpbl headquarters in chicago and close to each other : rockford of illinois , south bend of indiana and racine and kenosha of wisconsin . meyerhoff was given the responsibility of coordinating operations with city officials and civic leaders in the communities , as well as a projected budget was developed . in 1943 the league made an auspicious debut , but after the 1944 season wrigley sold the aagpbl to meyerhoff .
it was under meyerhoff management that expansion to six teams , as well as the publicity campaign of the aagpbl reached its peak . he re-organized the league so that each franchise would be governed through a league board of directors with representatives from each franchise . each club now had a voice in the adoption of rules and regulations and the direction of the sport . all assets were turned over to the new directors and wrigley was no longer involved with the league . the aagpbl excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season , when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans.meyerhoff also organized several companies outside his advertising agency to develop new products . one company he owned developed pam , a substitute for fats or oils that can be sprayed on pots and pans . in the mid-1950s , when meyerhoff was looking for a side business , he advertised for ideas and heard from two chemists who had developed something like a cooking spray . first , meyerhoff had the formula perfected so it could be sprayed ; then he campaigned for grocers to shelve pam in the baking aisle with the flours , not the aerosol section next to insecticides and hair spray . the name pam is an initialism for `` product of arthur meyerhoff . ``
in the 1960s meyerhoff wrote his book the strategy of persuasion , which reflects his point of views that the united states information agency should get out of the news business and into the business of selling democracy abroad . he sold his agency in 1979 .
meyerhoff died on august 29 , 1986 at his home in rancho santa fe , california , at the age of 91 .


== personal life ==
meyerhoff died in september 1986 ; services were held at the fourth presbyterian church in rancho santa fe , california . he was survived by his wife , elaine ; two sons , arthur e. meyerhoff jr. and dr. william l. meyerhoff ; three daughters , judith meyerhoff yale , jane meyerhoff bussier and joanne meyerhoff .

jean-baptiste-michel bucquet ( french : [ bykɛ ] ; 18 february 1746 – 24 january 1780 ) was a french chemist , member of the french royal academy of sciences , physician and public teacher .


== life and work ==
bucquet was born in paris , in 1746 . he was first sent to study law but he then turned to science and attended classes at the faculty of medicine in paris . there he encountered for the first time chemistry applied to medicine . despite financial trouble , he graduated in 1770 and thus became docteur-régent , and married marie claude leredde shortly after . he then started teaching a public course in chemistry in his own laboratory . between 1771 and 1773 , bucquet published a manual of chemistry , first on mineral then on vegetal chemistry , destined for the use of beginners in the science who need a coherent overview of the different processes and products in use . this manual was intended for people attending his course but also for those who could not . bucquet 's public course carried out for several years , and was mentioned in the journal de médecine . in 1775 , bucquet became professor of pharmacy at the faculty of medicine at the university of paris , and the next year , following the death of augustin roux , he took the chair of chemistry at the faculty . he became part of the french academy of sciences as a chemist in 1777 . during his years at the academy , he published a few works of chemical analysis , including one in collaboration with the duke of la rochefoucauld . he eventually acquired the laboratory in rue jacob which used to belong to the chemist rouelle and carried out his public courses there . he continued giving public courses until 1779 , at which point he became to ill to continue . he was known to be a very good teacher and many attended his courses . he died of his disease in 1780 .
his most famous pupil was antoine-françois fourcroy who later carried on bucquet 's work on natural history .


== collaboration with lavoisier ==
in 1777 , bucquet worked with antoine lavoisier at his residence of the arsenal , performed many fundamental experiments of chemistry , with the aim of checking if there results which were widely used in chemistry , could still be considered reliable . lavoisier had the financial means and necessary laboratory equipment to perform such a task and bucquet brought his many years of experience in public demonstration and laboratory expertise . together , they published 26 memoirs at the academy of sciences . which led to bucquet 's nomination as academician .

graduated from moscow state university ( moscow ) in 1948 . worked in the same university , then in the steklov mathematical institute ( moscow ) . he wrote more than 100 scientific papers

and several monographs , among which the textbook `` nuclear physics `` is particularly relevant .
.


== algebra of generalized functions ==
yu.shirokov had constructed the algebra of generalized functions . then it was applied to various systems
.


== classical and quantum mechanics ==
shirokov was , perhaps , not the first to mention that quantum mechanics has many classical limits . the planck constant




ℏ



{ \displaystyle ~\hbar ~ }
appears in many relations , and there are many options to keep some of parameters ( or even to vary them all ) as




ℏ
→
0



{ \displaystyle ~\hbar \rightarrow 0~ }
. the most known limiting cases of quantum mechanics are classical waves and newtonian mechanics . shirokov has systematised the construction of classical limits of quantum mechanics , see
.


== development of shirokov 's ideas ==
the most important ideas about the quantum mechanics and the theoretical physics in general formulated by
shirokov are not yet developed . in particular , the field theory in terms of wave packets ( i.e . , without divergent terms and without divergent series ) is not yet constructed .

jesse macy , the thirteenth of fourteen children , was born to quaker parents in indiana , but the family moved to central iowa in 1856 and started farming outside lynnville , near the newly founded town of grinnell . at age 17 , he entered iowa college , now grinnell college . during the civil war , he served in the union army and he did not graduate until after the war , earning an a.b . in 1870.during the 1870s , macy started what would become a long-term correspondence with james bryce , a noted british jurist and politician . in 1884 , he completed his ph.d. at johns hopkins university . the next year , he returned to the midwest to take a professorship at iowa college . for the next forty-two years , macy taught history and political science at the college.in the 1890s , macy defended radical aspects of the burgeoning social gospel taught at iowa college by professor of applied christianity george herron and college president george a . gates . macy supported liberal education in a newspaper article , saying :

suppose some emissary of darkness had spied out our liberty and had arraigned iowa college before the public as a place where young people were taught the dangerous doctrine of evolution . it may be that at so early a date the young professors would have been sent adrift and the public would have been assured that iowa college was a place where only safe opinions were allowed ! that is a place where only imbeciles and hypocrites are educated .
he was also a leading author of political science textbooks . macy 's 1896 manual on american civil government , our government . how it grew , what it does , and how it does it , was an influential primer for university students and his 1897 the english constitution : a commentary on its nature and growth was acclaimed for providing the necessary foundation in english law to correctly understand american law.in his 1904 work party organization and machinery macy wrote , `` while our party system is without old world models , it is strikingly in harmony with our other forms of political activity ... . `` and `` various references to party and faction found in the federalist illustrate the type of american ideas which prevailed before the american party system appeared `` ( pp . xiv-xvi ) . the work also included a whole chapter entitled `` effect of the city upon the party system `` .
in 1911 , grinnell awarded macy an honorary degree of doctor of laws.after retiring in 1912 , macy traveled widely and continued writing until his death in 1919.in february 2008 , grinnell 's board of trustees voted to name one of the college office buildings `` jesse macy house `` in memory of the long-serving professor . the building , at 1205 park st. , houses a number of interdisciplinary centers , including the center for peace studies and the rosenfield program.macy 's descendants include slac physicist h. pierre noyes .

melvin ellis calvin ( april 8 , 1911 – january 8 , 1997 ) was an american biochemist known for discovering the calvin cycle along with andrew benson and james bassham , for which he was awarded the 1961 nobel prize in chemistry . he spent most of his five-decade career at the university of california , berkeley .


== life ==
calvin was born in st. paul , minnesota , the son of elias calvin and rose herwitz , immigrants from the russian empire.as a small child calvin 's family moved to detroit ; he graduated from central high school in 1928 . melvin calvin earned his bachelor of science from the michigan college of mining and technology ( now known as michigan technological university ) in 1931 and his ph.d. in chemistry from the university of minnesota in 1935 . he then spent the next four years doing postdoctoral work at the university of manchester . he married marie genevieve jemtegaard in 1942 , and they had three children , two daughters and a son .
calvin joined the faculty at the university of california , berkeley , in 1937 and was promoted to professor of chemistry in 1947 . using the carbon-14 isotope as a tracer , calvin , andrew benson and james bassham mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis , starting from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds . in doing so , calvin , benson and bassham showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacturing of organic compounds , rather than on carbon dioxide as was previously believed . calvin was the sole recipient of the 1961 nobel prize for chemistry for what is sometimes known as the calvin–benson–bassham cycle . calvin wrote an autobiography three decades later titled following the trail of light : a scientific odyssey .
during the 1950s he was among the first members of the society for general systems research . in 1963 he was given the additional title of professor of molecular biology . he was founder and director of the laboratory of chemical biodynamics and simultaneously associate director of berkeley radiation laboratory , where he conducted much of his research until his retirement in 1980 . in his final years of active research , he studied the use of oil-producing plants as renewable sources of energy . he also spent many years testing the chemical evolution of life and wrote a book on the subject that was published in 1969 .


== controversy ==
in his 2011 television history of botany for the bbc , timothy walker , director of the university of oxford botanic garden , criticised calvin 's treatment of andrew benson , claiming that calvin had got the credit for benson 's work after firing him , and had failed to mention benson 's role when writing his autobiography decades later . benson himself has also mentioned being fired by calvin , and has complained about not being mentioned in his autobiography .


== honours and legacy ==
calvin was elected a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in 1958 . in 1959 he was elected a member of the german academy of sciences leopoldina.calvin was featured on the 2011 volume of the american scientists collection of us postage stamps , along with asa gray , maria goeppert-mayer , and severo ochoa . this was the third volume in the series , the first two having been released in 2005 and 2008 .

sir jack hibbert ( 14 february 1932 – 23 august 2005 ) was a british statistician and director of the central statistical office ( cso ) of the united kingdom , 1985–1992 . he was made a kcb in 1990 .


== background ==
sir jack hibbert was born in huddersfield , yorkshire , on 14 february 1932 . he was educated at leeds grammar school and the london school of economics and was married with two sons and one daughter . he died on 23 august 2005 in weybridge , surrey .


== career ==
hibbert joined the exchequer and audit department in 1952 and then moved to the central statistical office in 1960 , where he worked on economics statistics . he was promoted to chief statistician in 1970 and to assistant director in 1977 . in 1981 , he spent a period on loan to the oecd and to eurostat as a consultant and then joined the department of trade and industry as a director of statistics . on 1 august 1985 , he was appointed director of the central statistical office in succession to sir john boreham . he retired in 1992 .


== central statistical office ==
when jack hibbert took over the cso , it had suffered four years of cutbacks following the 'rayner review ' of official statistics . shortly after this , the then chancellor of the exchequer , nigel lawson , and other conservative politicians claimed that misleading statistics were largely responsible for the government 's poor handling of the economy . the treasury and civil service select committee recommended ' a thorough review into the operation of various departments involved in the collection of national accounts statistics ' . the review , by stephen pickford , recommended that there should be just one organisation responsible for the collection and compilation of statistics for national accounts .
this meant moving the business statistics office and responsibility for data on imports and exports from the department of trade and industry , and responsibility for the retail prices index from the department of employment . the changes , in july 1989 , increased the cso from just under 170 staff to about 1,000 . this was probably the biggest shake-up of official statistics since the creation of the cso in 1941 . jack hibbert had the difficult job of creating this new organisation .

== works ==

scotus academicus ( 1901 ) , the best known of the writings of frassen . this work is rightly considered one of the most important and scholarly presentations of the theology of duns scotus . few , if any , of the numerous interpreters and commentators of scotus have succeeded so well as frassen in combining simplicity of style and clearness of method with that subtleness of thought which characterizes scotistic theology as a whole . the value of the work is enhanced by frequent quotations from the church fathers , and by an impartial statement of all controversial questions in scholastic theology . the first volume is prefaced with a chronological list and a brief historical and dogmatical account of the different heresies from the beginnings of christianity to the fifteenth century . the edition of the scotus academicus published by the friars minor ( rome , 1900–02 , in twelve volumes ) was prepared from notes left by the author himself and preserved in the bibliothèque nationale of paris . earlier editions were those of paris ( 1672–77 ) , rome ( 1721 ) , venice ( 1744 ) .

during the nazi occupation of voronezh , at the age of just 16 , feoktistov fought with the soviet army against the german troops , carrying out reconnaissance missions for the voronezh front . after being captured by a waffen-ss army patrol , feoktistov was shot by a german officer . however , the bullet went right through his chin and neck and did not kill him . feoktistov was able to crawl out later and then make his way to the soviet lines .
after the war was over , feoktistov enrolled in the bauman moscow higher technical school as an engineering student and he graduated in 1949 . feoktistov also later earned a doctorate in physics . he joined mikhail tikhonravov 's okb ( design bureau ) , and in 1955 , feoktistov formed part of the team that went on to design the sputnik satellites , the vostok space capsule , the voskhod space capsule , and the soyuz space capsule under the leadership of the soviet chief designer sergey korolev . during this time , feoktistov also worked on a design for an ion-propelled spacecraft to be capable of taking humans to mars .
in 1964 , feoktistov was selected as part of a group of engineers for cosmonaut training , and in october of that very same year , he was hastily assigned to the multi-disciplinary voskhod 1 crew . he was the first civilian to make a space flight , and the only cosmonaut in the soviet union who was not a member of the communist party of the soviet union . during his space flight , he spent just over 24 hours and 17 minutes in space.after the flight of voskhod 1 , feoktistov 's training for any further space mission was discontinued for medical reasons . however , feoktistov continued his outer space engineering work , and he later became the head of the soviet space design bureau that designed the salyut and mir space stations .
in october 1969 , konstantin feoktistov and georgi beregovoi traveled as guests of nasa throughout the us , visiting any city they chose and disneyland in california – they were joined on the trip by us astronauts as hosts , including eugene cernan , neil armstrong and others . kirk douglas and others hosted receptions for them in hollywood – they were protected by special agents of the us state department on request of nasa . almost every place they went when accompanied by eugene cernan , if a band was present the song `` fly me to the moon `` was played – when they visited disneyland they enjoyed the ride trip to the moon , then joked with the us astronauts that they went to disneyland and not the moon . it was a trip that all enjoyed and international friendships were made .
feoktistov resigned from his engineering position with energia and then returned to bauman moscow higher technical school as a professor in 1990 .

= betty eisner =
betty grover eisner ( september 29 , 1915 – july 1 , 2004 ) was an american psychologist known for pioneering the use of lsd and other psychedelic drugs as adjuncts to psychotherapy .


== early life and education ==
eisner grew up in kansas city , missouri , where she graduated from the sunset hill school in 1933 . she earned her undergraduate degree in political science from stanford university in 1937 . during world war ii , she served as a red cross volunteer . after the war , she traveled across europe , an experience she documented in a series of letters to the los angeles times . after returning to the u.s. , she earned a ph.d. in clinical psychology from the university of california , los angeles .


== professional life ==
eisner conducted psychotherapy research , first with sidney cohen at the neuropsychiatric hospital veterans administration center in los angeles and , later , from her private practice in los angeles . eisner authored a book , `` the unused potential of marriage and sex `` , which was published in 1970 . she also helped found the school for learning , which taught english in mexico . in the 1990s , she maintained a private practice in santa monica , california , occasionally publishing articles on psychotherapy and serving on the board of advisors for the albert hofmann foundation . in 2002 , eisner wrote an unpublished autobiographical account of her career entitled `` remembrances of lsd therapy past `` .


== lsd research ==
eisner 's accomplishments are considerable , even if one does not consider how few independent women scientists there were in the 1950s and 1960s . she conducted early research into the use of lsd to treat alcoholism and maintained an active interest in hallucinogens throughout her career . along with sidney cohen , eisner appears to have originated the practice of using simultaneous male and female therapists or researchers during human hallucinogen administration . eisner was a therapist for bill wilson , co-founder of alcoholics anonymous , when he tried lsd . in addition to using hallucinogens like lsd and mescaline in psychedelic therapy , eisner also gave stimulants such as methylphenidate and the inhaled gas mixture carbogen to her patients .
however , eisner 's interest in finding new tools for psychotherapy was not limited to drugs . eisner was particularly focused on extra-pharmacological variables that she felt influenced outcome of psychotherapeutic sessions . she considered the specific individuals present as an important variable in therapeutic outcome and sometimes conducted sessions in group settings . some of these group sessions included `` encounter group `` -style expression and body work . eisner also described the psychotherapeutic importance of a variable she called 'matrix . ' this term encompassed the everyday living space and larger social context in which the patient lived and returned to between sessions.betty eisner 's publications and personal correspondence are archived at stanford university .

= calvin mooers =
calvin northrup mooers ( october 24 , 1919 – december 1 , 1994 ) , was an american computer scientist known for his work in information retrieval and for the programming language trac .


== early life ==
mooers was a native of minneapolis , minnesota , attended the university of minnesota , and received a bachelor 's degree in mathematics in 1941 . he worked at the naval ordnance laboratory from 1941 to 1946 , and then attended the massachusetts institute of technology , where he earned a master 's degree in mathematics and physics . at m.i.t . he developed a mechanical system using superimposed codes of descriptors for information retrieval called zatocoding . he founded the zator company in 1947 to market this idea , and pursued work in information theory , information retrieval , and artificial intelligence .
he coined the term `` information retrieval `` using it first in a conference paper presented in march 1950 . see also a short paper published later that year from mooers .


== mooers 's law ==
he coined `` mooers 's law `` ( not to be confused with moore 's law ) and its corollary in 1959 :

an information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it .
where an information retrieval system tends not to be used , a more capable information retrieval system may tend to be used even less .


== trac ==
he founded the rockford research institute in 1961 , where he developed the trac programming language , and attempted to control its distribution and development using trademark law and a unique invocation of
copyright . ( at the time patent law would not allow him to control what he saw as his intellectual property and profit from it . ) the trademark strategy was later used by ada .


== awards ==
mooers received the american society for information science 's award of merit in 1978 . the citation reads in part :

he was a participant in early developmental work on digital computers , a researcher , author , and implementer of applications in information retrieval ; and a prophet in the 1950s describing the future importance of what is now called computer networks and distributive processing , and daring to predict that machines could simulate thought processes in retrieving computerized information . in 1947 , he proposed the zator , an electronic , film-scanning retrieval machine , and made the first proposal to use the boolean operations or , and , and not to prescribe selections in retrieval machines . he developed his own zatocoding system in 1948 using superimposed subject codes on edge-notched cards . he coined the term `` information retrieval `` in 1950 , and went on from there to obtain several patents in information retrieval and signaling , produce a text-handling language ( trac ) , author some 200 publications , and form one of the first companies whose only concern was information . his thinking has affected all who are in the field of information and his early ideas are now incorporated into today 's reality .


== death ==
mooers died in 1994 in cambridge , massachusetts . mooers 's article critical of john vincent atanasoff and his brief tenure as chief of a failed computer construction project at the naval ordnance laboratory during world war ii , was published posthumously in the may–june 2001 issue of ieee annals of the history of computing .
his daughter edith was on the original incarnation of zoom on pbs .

= thomas obicini =
thomas obicini of novara ( italian : tomasso obicini da novara ; 1585 – 7 november 1632 ) was a franciscan friar , originally from novara , italy . as an early orientalist , arabist and linguist , he translated arabic texts into latin and took possession of the grotto of nazareth for the franciscan order in 1620 .


== journey to nazareth ==
in 1620 fra obicini 's travelled to jerusalem to the emir of beirut , fakhr ad-din ii .
the background to this mission began seven years earlier , in 1613 , when fakhr ad-din ii had taken refuge in tuscany , italy . the emir formed an alliance with the medici ruler , cosimo ii , and spent two years under his protection . he spent three more in sicily and naples seeking , and failing , to rally a crusade against ottoman rule . by 1618 the changed political situation permitted his return to lebanon .
two years later friar obicini journeyed to jerusalem in an embassy with lord battista tarquet , the consul of all palestine , sent by the consul of sidon , the christian king , lord albert gardana and the prosecutor of the holy land , lord francis lebar .
in beirut , obicini was , according to his account , warmly and lavishly received by the emir ad-din , who had readily granted the two christian holy sites , the grotto of the annunciation , i.e . the grotto of nazareth , and mount tabor to his franciscan order .
in his description of the acquisition of the holy sites he recounts how he travelling to nazareth , as a small group of a priest , friar john of vendôme , and a sicilian friar , francesco salice , had brought letters from the princes , various testimonials , and a decree from the qadi of safed . on saturday 29 november 1620 , the group took possession of the sanctuary built on the foundations of the house of loreto and known as the holy grotto - the site venerated by christians as the place where the angel gabriel announced the birth of christ to the virgin mary.while obicini was abbot in the convent of aleppo , syria he had mastered syriac , arabic , hebrew , aramaic , and coptic languages . in 1621 , he was the first lector in arabic in the san pietro in montorio convent and was a precursor of athanasius kircher .
in 1631 obicini published grammatica arabica ; a latin translation of the 13th-14th century arabic grammar matn al ajrumiyyah , ( إلاجرُومِية ) , by abū abdullaahi muhammad bin muhammad bin dāwūd aṣ-ṣanhaajī , known as ibn adjurrum .
in 1636 obicini published thesaurus arabico-syro-latinus , his opus magnum ; a latin expanded translation of elijah of nisibis 's 11th-century glossary intended to assist latin-speaking prelates in converting syrians and other arabic speakers .

= george cassander =
george cassander ( or cassant ) ( 1513 – 3 february 1566 ) was a flemish theologian .


== life ==
born at pittem near bruges , he went at an early age to leuven . he was teaching theology and literature in 1541 at bruges and shortly afterwards at ghent . about 1549 he moved to cologne , where , after a profound study of the points of difference between the catholic and reformed churches , he devoted himself to the project of reunion , thus anticipating the efforts of gottfried leibniz . he died at cologne on 3 february 1566 . the collected edition of his works was published in 1616 at paris .


== works ==
in 1561 he published anonymously de officio pii ac publicae tranquillitatis vere amantis viri in hoc religionis dissidio ( basel ) , in which , while holding that no one , on account of abuses , has a right utterly to subvert the church , he does not disguise his dislike of those who exaggerated the papal claims . he takes his standpoint on scripture explained by tradition and the fathers of the first six centuries .
at a time when controversy drowned the voice of reason , such a book pleased neither party ; but as some of the german princes thought that he could heal the breach , the emperor ferdinand asked him to publish his consultatio de articulis fidei lute , catholicos et protestantes controversis ( 1565 ) , in which , like newman at a later date , he tried to put a catholic interpretation upon protestant formularies .
while never attacking dogma , and even favouring the roman church on the ground of authority , he criticizes the papal power and makes reflections on practices . the work , attacked violently by the leuven theologians on one side , and by calvin and beza on the other , was put on the roman index in 1617 .

phyllis nicolson ( 21 september 1917 – 6 october 1968 ) was a british mathematician most known for her work on the crank–nicolson method together with john crank .


== biography ==
nicolson was born phyllis lockett in macclesfield and went to stockport high school for girls . she graduated from manchester university with a b.sc . in 1938 , m.sc . in 1939 and a ph.d. in physics in 1946 . she was a research student in cambridge from 1945 and a tucker-price research fellow of girton college , cambridge from 1946 to 1949 . she married malcolm nicolson , also a physicist , in 1942 and had two sons . the family moved to leeds where malcolm nicolson was appointed to a lectureship in physics at leeds university . malcolm nicolson died accidentally in 1951 , and phyllis was appointed to take over his lectureship . in 1955 , she married physicist malcolm mccaig by whom she had another son . she died from breast cancer in 1968 in sheffield .


== work ==
during her time in manchester , nicolson worked with douglas hartree and became a proficient numerical analyst and an expert user of hartree 's differential analyser . nicolson initially worked on cosmic ray problems , but after the outbreak of war hartree 's differential analyser group pursued defence-related problems . two of the problems in her thesis are derived from work done for the ministry of supply . one of these problems was on solutions of the heat equation , and with her colleague john crank she investigated the numerical stability of several solution techniques . the algorithm now known as the crank–nicolson method emerged from this work and was published in 1947 .

on graduating from school in 1843 , he went to the university of jena and then to the university of königsberg to study theology . at königsberg he changed courses , deciding to focus on mathematics and physics after meeting the inspiring franz neumann . among amsler 's fellow students at königsberg were gustav robert kirchhoff and siegfried heinrich aronhold . amsler gained his doctorate from königsberg in 1848 and returned to switzerland in the same year . in 1851 he became a privatdozent at the university of zürich and later in that year accepted a position as a mathematics teacher at the gymnasium in schaffhausen . in 1854 amsler married elise laffon ( 1830–1899 ) . the couple had two daughters and three sons . their oldest son alfred amsler ( 1857–1940 ) was a mathematician and engineer in his own right and succeeded to his father as the owner and director of the factory . from about 1885 until about 1905 , father and son closely cooperated on many projects in their business ; many of their ideas , inventions and constructions of the time are difficult to attribute to either one of them .
jakob amsler-laffon invented the polar planimeter in 1854 .

= james l. tuck =
james leslie tuck obe , ( 9 january 1910 – 15 december 1980 ) was a british physicist . he was born in manchester , england , and educated at the victoria university of manchester . because of his involvement with the manhattan project , he was unable to submit his thesis on time and never received his doctoral degree .
in 1937 he was offered an appointment as a salter research fellow at oxford university , where he worked with leó szilárd on particle accelerators .
at the outbreak of world war ii , he was appointed as the scientific advisor to frederick alexander lindemann , who was on the private staff of winston churchill . his research included work on shaped charges , used in anti-tank weapons . for this work he received the order of the british empire from king george vi .


== bomb work ==
his expertise on shaped charges led to his being sent to los alamos , where he was a member of the british delegation to the manhattan project and helped in the development of explosive lensing and the urchin initiator [ 1 ] . this work was crucial to the success of the plutonium atomic bomb .
after the war , he returned briefly to england , where he worked at the clarendon laboratory at oxford university . however , he found the postwar conditions there difficult and in 1949 returned to the united states , assuming a position at the university of chicago . a year later , he returned to los alamos when he was invited to work on thermonuclear research .


== fusion power ==
at los alamos , tuck took up research on fusion power , which he had learned about in the uk . tuck suggested that the los alamos group pursue a pinch program similar to the one being carried out in the uk . this was only months after lyman spitzer had started work on his stellarator design . both were invited to washington to present their ideas , where spitzer won $ 50,000 in funding from the atomic energy commission . returning to los alamos , he arranged for a similar $ 50,000 from the lab 's discretionary budget and started a pinch project under the name perhapsatron .
like all pinch systems , perhapsatron failed due to instabilities in the plasma . theoretical work by edward teller and others suggested ways out of the instability problem , either pinching so quickly that fusion took place before the instabilities formed , or by using `` cusped `` magnetic fields . the former was developed as the columbus while the latter became the picket fence reactor design , both led by tuck 's teams .
he remained at los alamos until his retirement in 1972 . earlier in 1972 he had published a review in the bulletin of the atomic scientists of the book beyond the ivory tower : the frontiers of public and private science by solly zuckerman .
after his retirement tuck became a prominent public supporter of research into thermonuclear fusion for power generation . he also became interested in the phenomenon of ball lightning , probably because of the connection between plasmas and their role in fusion power schemes , and in 1980 he appeared in the arthur c. clarke 's mysterious world episode 'clarke 's cabinet of curiosities ' where he described his experiments at los alamos , carried out during lunch breaks , to create ball lightning using a large storage battery of the type then used in submarines .

= john gill ( theologian ) =
john gill ( 23 november 1697 – 14 october 1771 ) was an english baptist pastor , biblical scholar , and theologian who held to a firm calvinistic soteriology . born in kettering , northamptonshire , he attended kettering grammar school where he mastered the latin classics and learned greek by age 11 . he continued self-study in everything from logic to hebrew , his love for the latter remaining throughout his life .


== early life and education ==
at the age of about 12 , gill heard a sermon from his pastor , william wallis , on the text , `` and the lord god called unto adam , and said unto him , where art thou ? `` ( genesis 3:9 ) . the message stayed with gill and eventually led to his conversion . it was not until six years later that he made a public profession when he was 18 .


== pastoral work ==
his first pastoral work was as an intern assisting john davis at higham ferrers in 1718 at age 21 . he became pastor at the strict baptist church at goat yard chapel , horsleydown , southwark in 1719 . his pastorate lasted 51 years . in 1757 his congregation needed larger premises and moved to a carter lane , st. olave ’ s street , southwark . this baptist church was once pastored by benjamin keach and would later become the new park street chapel and then the metropolitan tabernacle pastored by charles spurgeon .
during gill 's ministry , the church strongly supported the preaching of george whitefield at nearby kennington common .


== various works ==
in 1748 , gill was awarded the honorary degree of doctor of divinity by the university of aberdeen . he was a profound scholar and a prolific author . his most important works are :

the doctrine of the trinity stated and vindicated ( london , 1731 )
the cause of god and truth ( 4 parts , 1735–38 ) , a retort to daniel whitby 's five points
an exposition of the new testament ( 3 vols . , 1746–48 ) , which with his exposition of the old testament ( 6 vols . , 1748–63 ) forms his magnum opus
a collection of sermons and tracts [ 1 ]
a dissertation concerning the antiquity of the hebrew language , letters , vowel-points , and accents ( 1767 )
a body of doctrinal divinity ( 1767 )
a body of practical divinity ( 1770 ) .gill also edited and re-published the works of the antinomian theologian rev . tobias crisp , d.d . ( 1600–1643 ) .


== significance ==
john gill was the first major writing baptist theologian , his work retaining influence into the 21st century . gill 's relationship with hyper-calvinism in english baptist life is a matter of debate . peter toon has argued that gill was himself a hyper-calvinist , which would make gill the father of baptist hyper-calvinism . however , tom nettles and timothy george have argued that gill was not a hyper-calvinist . gill 's works are still highly regarded by primitive baptists and related groups .

wolfgang max paul gaede ( 25 may 1878 – 24 june 1945 ) was a german physicist and pioneer of vacuum engineering .


== life ==

gaede was born in lehe , bremerhaven , the son of prussian colonel karl gaede and amalia , nee renf . in 1897 he began studying medicine at the university of freiburg , but he soon switched to the field of physics . in 1901 he wrote his doctoral thesis on the change of the specific heat of metals with temperature . subsequent research on the volta effect in a vacuum was unsuccessful , as the pump technology of the time could not create sufficient vacuum for the investigations . this prompted gaede to deal more closely with vacuum technology . he invented the rotating mercury pump for high vacuum , which he presented to his scientific colleagues in 1905 at a congress in merano . also in freiburg im breisgau , gaede wrote his habilitation thesis on the external friction of gases in 1909 .
in 1913 he received a professorship at the university of freiburg . in the following six years , he invented the momentum transfer pump ( molecular pump ) and a mercury diffusion pump . in 1919 , gaede joined the karlsruhe institute of technology as a professor of experimental physics , where he worked in the following research areas :

vacuum technology
radio and communications technology
process for obtaining pure hydrogen and mercury
exploration of lightning protection equipment
movement of liquids in a rotating hollow ringin 1930 , gaede was elected a member of the academy of sciences leopoldina . in 1933/34 two employees denounced gaede to the gestapo , as having called the national socialists `` childish `` . he then had to retire , although all allegations proved to be false . despite this incident , the werner von siemens ring for 1933 was given to him in 1934 . he also received various awards at international level in the following years .
a lifelong consultancy contract from 1906 with leybold gmbh of cologne made it possible for him to continue his research in his private laboratory in karlsruhe and later in munich . among other things , he invented the gas ballast principle . gaede was the owner of almost 40 patents in germany , and many others abroad . a call to return to the university in karlsruhe after the end of the war did not reach gaede .
gaede died in munich in 1945 .

== biography ==
born in the same house in hamburg where felix mendelssohn had been born the previous year , david was raised jewish but later converted to protestant christianity . david was a pupil of louis spohr and moritz hauptmann from 1823 to 1824 and in 1826 became a violinist at königstädtischen theater in berlin . in 1829 he was the first violinist of baron carl gotthard von liphardt 's ( father of karl eduard von liphart ) string quartet in dorpat and he undertook concert tours in riga , saint petersburg and moscow . in 1835 he became concertmaster ( konzertmeister ) at the gewandhaus in leipzig working with mendelssohn . david returned to dorpat to marry liphart 's daughter sophie . in 1843 david became the first professor of violin ( violinlehrer ) at the newly founded leipziger konservatorium für musik .
david worked closely with mendelssohn , providing technical advice during the preparation of the latter 's violin concerto in e minor . he was also the soloist in the premiere of the work in 1845 , and , with clara schumann , played the official premiere of schumann 's first violin sonata in leipzig in march 1852 .
he died suddenly in 1873 , aged 63 , while on a mountain excursion with his children , near klosters in the graubünden ( grisons ) area of switzerland .

david 's own compositions number about 50 opuses . they include 12 `` theme and variations `` pieces for violin and orchestra , five violin concertos , a string sextet , `` concertinos `` for violin , bassoon , clarinet & trombone and orchestra , and a number of lieder . supposedly he also wrote two symphonies and an opera ( hans wacht , 1852 ) . unfortunately , these have not been verified to have been preserved .

he also wrote an often used version of the cadenza for beethoven 's violin-concerto , used by 12-year old joseph joachim at the revival-concert of this piece in 1844 , under felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .


== trivia ==
david played on a 1742 guarneri violin , which later became the main performance violin for jascha heifetz . the david guarneri violin is now in the collection of the fine arts museums of san francisco ; it is on permanent loan to alexander barantschik who has showcased it with the san francisco symphony and san francisco academy orchestra.on the recommendation of william sterndale bennett , with whom he had worked in leipzig , david 's son paul david became the first director of music at uppingham school from 1864–1908 .

== karl marx 's references to fraas ==
karl marx took an interest in fraas 's work , writing to engels on 25 march 1868 that he found fraas 's 1847 work climate and the vegetable world throughout the ages , a history of both `` very interesting , especially as proving that climate and flora have changed in historic times `` .
marx calls fraas `` a darwinist before darwin `` and goes on to say : this man is both a thoroughly learned philologist ( he has written books in greek ) and a chemist , agricultural expert , etc . the whole conclusion is that cultivation when it progresses in a primitive way and is not consciously controlled ( as a bourgeois of course he does not arrive at this ) , leaves deserts behind it , persia , mesopotamia , etc . , greece . here again another unconscious socialist tendency ! these references to fraas are of interest to recent scholars of marx 's ecological ideas .

== biography ==
madame fraya would use a person 's hand and handwriting to predict his/her future , but she admitted to not following the principles of traditional chiromancy , and just making use of her instinctual knowledge . her clients included important french artists and politicians of the time , such as the princess of saxe-meningen ( sister of emperor wilhelm ii of germany ) , to whom she reportedly predicted world war i and the defeat of germany in it . she was subsequently called into the french ministry of war , where she assured the government that the marching german troops would not reach paris ( they were in fact stopped at the first battle of the marne ) . the abilities displayed by fraya were studied by alfred binet , eugéne osty , and albert von schrenck-notzing .
biographer simone de tervagne has written several books about fraya .


== investigations ==
in december 1929 , antônio da silva mello attended a psychic reading session with madame fraya . mello brought with him some letters . fraya made totally inaccurate statements about the letters , for example on studying a letter that mello had written the same morning she stated it was written by someone else and gave excessively general characterisation details that would be applicable to most people . she said one of the letters had been written by a man but it had actually been written by a female relative of mello.fraya also gave many false statements to mello . she said he was the father of two children when he did not have any . she examined his hand and stated he was thirty-two years old , although he was forty-three at the time . mello noted that `` the revelations obtained in my consultation with madame fraya were no more than vague generalities , which would be commonly applied to any person . `` mello also attended a session with fraya in january , 1930 . the result was a complete failure , she made many incorrect statements . mello `` left her office annoyed and disillusioned `` .fraya duped the psychical researcher eugéne osty into believing she had genuine psychic powers .

== career ==
beurling was born in gothenburg , sweden and was the son of the landowner konrad beurling and baroness elsa raab . after graduating in 1924 , he was enrolled at the uppsala university where he received a bachelor of arts degree in 1926 and two years later a licentiate of philosophy degree . beurling was assistant teacher at uppsala university from 1931 to 1933 . he received his doctorate in mathematics in 1933 for his dissertation études sur un problème de majoration . beurling was a docent of mathematics at uppsala university from 1933 and then professor of mathematics from 1937 to 1954 . he was visiting professor at harvard university from 1948 to 1949 . from 1954 he was professor at the institute for advanced study at princeton university , united states , where he took over albert einstein 's office .


== world war ii ==
in the summer of 1940 he single-handedly deciphered and reverse-engineered an early version of the siemens and halske t52 also known as the geheimfernschreiber ( `` secret teletypewriter `` ) used by nazi germany in world war ii for sending ciphered messages . the t52 was one of the so-called `` fish cyphers `` , that , using transposition , created nearly one quintillion ( 893,622,318,929,520,960 ) different variations . it took beurling two weeks to solve the problem using pen and paper . using beurling 's work , a device was created that enabled sweden to decipher german teleprinter traffic passing through sweden from norway on a cable . in this way , swedish authorities knew about operation barbarossa before it occurred . since the swedes would not reveal how this knowledge was attained , the swedish warning was not treated as credible by soviets .
this became the foundation for the swedish national defence radio establishment ( fra ) . the cypher in the geheimfernschreiber is generally considered to be more complex than the cypher used in the enigma machines .

sir clifford charles butler frs ( 20 may 1922 – 30 june 1999 ) was an english physicist , best known for the discovery of the hyperon and meson types of particles . in later life , butler was involved in educational policy , serving as director of the nuffield foundation and vice-chancellor of loughborough university .


== life ==
butler was born in reading on 20 may 1922 , the son of charles hannington james butler , a clerk and buyer to a local wholesale grocer , and his wife olive pembroke . he attended both reading school and the university of reading , becoming both a bachelor of science and a doctor of philosophy there . he was appointed assistant lecturer in physics at the university of manchester in 1945 , and lecturer in 1947 . in the same year he married kathleen betty collins . they had two daughters . he died in leicester on 30 june 1999 .


== work ==
at manchester , butler worked with g. d. rochester , studying cosmic rays using a cloud chamber . during this research , they found two unexpected events , one in october 1946 and one in may 1947 , showing previously unknown particles . these v particles were a thousand times heavier than the electron and long-lived on nuclear timescales . in order to increase the rate of detection with a higher flux of cosmic rays , the equipment was moved to the pic du midi de bigorre observatory in the pyrenees . the existence of the particles was confirmed by a group from the california institute of technology led by carl anderson , and the butler group continued to study them and found that there were two types , hyperons and mesons . butler 's and rochester 's discovery may be seen as the first step towards understanding of the quark structure of matter.in 1953 , butler left manchester to lead a high-energy nuclear physics group at imperial college in london . he was promoted to professor in 1957 , and head of the physics department in 1963 . while at imperial college london , butler chaired the consortium established to design the british national hydrogen bubble chamber , which was operated at the rutherford appleton laboratory and cern . from 1964 , he chaired the cern track chamber committee .. he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1961 , and served as dean of the royal college of science between 1966 and 1969 . over this period he became increasingly interested in educational policy , joining the academic planning board of the university of kent in 1963 , the schools council in 1965 , and the university grants committee in 1966 . he eventually served on the schools council for 19 years.in 1970 , butler resigned from imperial college and his active involvement in physical research ceased . he accepted the role of director of the nuffield foundation , a charitable foundation influential in education . during his time there he set up a group for research and innovation in higher education , a programme for law and society , and the centre for agricultural strategy at the university of reading . his role in the establishment of the open university was also important , since the nuffield foundation funded a course on genetics as a test bed for other courses . he was appointed to the council of the open university in 1971 and stayed as a member until 1995 , serving as vice-chairman from 1986 to 1995 . in 1975 , butler was appointed vice-chancellor of loughborough university , retaining that post until he retired in 1985 .

== economics ==
margaret g. reid was a pioneer in the research on the importance of non-market activities , especially of the household for the economy . her work included household production and consumption , relationships between health , income and productivity and housework.her first book , economics of household production , was published in 1934 . reid , like her phd advisor hazel kyrk , sought to theorize the productive contribution made by domestic activities within the household . she was arguing for a national accounting that included non-market activities to better mirror economic activities . furthermore , she called for the recognition of unpaid work and delivered a pragmatic definition for work itself as activities that have a positive utility and could be transferred through a market ( even if they are not produced for a market ) . feminist economists would later argue that this work was underappreciated and even ignored , pointing out its similarity to gary becker 's 1965 nobel-prize winning theory of time allocation.after becoming emeritus , she continued to research and write until her death in 1991 . in later years her work was preoccupied with the relationship between demographic factors such as age , race , health , and income , and productivity and consumption .
the american economic association named reid a distinguished fellow in 1980 , recognizing her as a `` truly tireless colleague `` whose contributions to the field were complemented by a `` felicitous sense of humour . `` in 1996 feminist economics devoted an issue to recognizing her research .

friedrich leopold goltz ( 14 august 1834 in posen ( poznań ) , grand duchy of posen – 5 may 1902 in straßburg ( strasbourg ) ) was a german physiologist and nephew of the writer bogumil goltz .
he studied medicine at the university of königsberg , and following two years of surgical training , served as a prosector of anatomy in königsberg . in 1870 he succeeded a.w . volkmann as professor of physiology at the university of halle , followed by a professorship at the university of straßburg ( from 1872 ) . he is known for his experiments in neurophysiology , and is credited as being the first scientist to perform a hemispherectomy on a dog .
in 1870 he introduced the `` hydrostatic concept `` involving the semicircular canals of the inner ear and their ability to transmit sensations of position , and therefore providing assistance in equilibrioception . goltz proposed that the canals dealt mainly with the equilibrium of the head , and that the movements of the body were regulated by the more or less conscious awareness an individual has of the position of his head in space.goltz held a unitary view of brain function , which he demonstrated in london at the international medical congress of 1881 . here he showed that a dog with sections of its cerebral cortex removed , could still remain functional . conversely , scottish neurologist david ferrier held the belief of localization of cerebral functions , which he demonstrated at the same conference . ferrier presented macaque monkeys with particular paralysis following specific surgeries of the motor cortex . ferrier 's demonstration of localized functionality impressed the medical community , and was seen as a major impetus in the development of neurological surgery .


== published works ==
he published several articles on the function of the heart and on the venous tone in virchows archiv of pathological anatomy as well as in pflügers archiv of physiology . among his principal writings are the following :

beiträge zur lehre von den funktionen des nervensystems des frosches , berlin : august hirschwald , 1869 - contributions to knowledge on functions of the nervous system in frogs .
über die verrichtungen des grosshirns . gesammelte abhandlungen , bonn 1881 - on actions of the cerebrum .

= reid bryson =
reid bryson ( 7 june 1920 – 11 june 2008 ) was an american atmospheric scientist , geologist and meteorologist . he was a professor emeritus of the university of wisconsin–madison . he completed a b.a . in geology at denison university in 1941 and a ph.d. in meteorology from the university of chicago in 1948 . in 1946 he joined the faculty of the university of wisconsin–madison , and in 1948 he became the founder and first chairman of the university of wisconsin-madison 's department of meteorology and center for climatic research . he was the first director of the institute for environmental studies ( now the nelson institute ) in 1970.in 1944 , during world war ii , he was one of the few meteorologists who accurately identified typhoon cobra , which savaged halsey 's third fleet .
bryson was made a global laureate by the united nations global environment program in 1990 .


== views ==
bryson 's main contribution to the debate on climate change was the idea of `` the human volcano `` causing global cooling , via an increase in aerosol loading . this idea was sparked in 1962 by his own observation , while flying across india en route to a conference , that his view of the ground was blocked not by clouds but by dust . at the time , the instrumental temperature record did not show unambiguous warming and the view that the earth might be cooling , and heading for further cooling , was not unreasonable . others , including hubert lamb , who created a dust veil index , thought volcanoes were more responsible for global-scale aerosol.in 1973 , bryson testified to congress that global warming from fossil-fuel combustion was politically unstoppable .

there is no way right now that we can control the climate to make it more benign . even if we were to say `` let us stop using fossil fuels so that we do not add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , because that impacts the world climate , `` how on earth could you stop using fossil fuels ? even those countries that are most heavily impacted by the climatic change are the ones who say it is our turn to be affluent and it is in the use of fossil fuels that one gains affluence.in later years , when it was clear that the climate was indeed warming , bryson argued that while climate change and a global increase in temperature are real , he did not believe that they are caused by human activity . rather , he argued that they are part of natural global climate cycles , particularly the end of the little ice age :

`` all this argument is the temperature going up or not , it ’ s absurd , `` bryson continues . `` of course it ’ s going up . it has gone up since the early 1800s , before the industrial revolution , because we ’ re coming out of the little ice age , not because we ’ re putting more carbon dioxide into the air . ``

= alwyn gentry =
alwyn howard gentry ( january 6 , 1945 – august 3 , 1993 ) was an american botanist and plant collector , who made major contributions to the understanding of the vegetation of tropical forests .


== education ==
gentry was born on january 6 , 1945 in clay center , kansas , and received his schooling at the clay center community high school , from which he graduated in 1963 . he graduated from kansas state university in 1967 with a b.a . in physical science and a b.s . in botany and zoology . he earned his master 's degree in 1969 at the university of wisconsin–madison as a student of botanist hugh iltis , with a thesis on the genus tabebuia ( bignoniaceae ) of central america , a subject which he continued to study at washington university in st. louis , missouri , from which he received his doctorate in 1972 , with a ph.d. thesis entitled an eco-evolutionary study of the bignoniaceae of south central america .


== career ==
gentry spent his entire working career at the missouri botanical garden , starting as an assistant curator in october 1972 . in 1974 , he made his first visit to peru , a country that became the major focus of much of his subsequent work ; he made his second trip there in 1976 and by the time of his death had visited the country 33 times . he also maintained his interest in the bignoniaceae : he contributed treatments of the family to nine volumes , including the flora of panama , and had a further five in press when he died .
one of gentry 's major innovations was the use of transect samples as a tool for assessing the composition and structure of tropical forests , known as the gentry forest transect . his method , allied to his encyclopedic knowledge of tropical plants , allowed him to sample a site in a matter of days , and over the course of his career he amassed data from over 200 such transects worldwide .
alwyn gentry was prolific both as an author and as a plant collector : he published over 200 works and had many more on hand at the time of his death ; and he collected over 80,000 plant specimens , hundreds of which have proved to be species new to science . because many of the plants that he encountered during his transect sampling were not flowering , gentry developed the ability to identify species from vegetative specimens , not just from flowers and fruits , an ability that led to the publication of his field guide to the families and genera of woody plants of northwest south america , completed just months before his death .
in 1990 , conservation international established a rapid assessment program ( rap ) to undertake quick assessments of areas deemed to be significant for conservation . gentry 's transect method was well suited to such work and he became increasingly involved as a member of the rap team .


== death ==
on august 3 , 1993 , alwyn gentry was on a rap mission in western ecuador , when the light aircraft in which he was traveling crashed into a mountain ridge near guayaquil . four people—the pilot , gentry , american ornithologist theodore a. parker iii , and ecuadorian ecologist eduardo aspiazu—died in the crash ; three other researchers survived . parker and gentry are memorialized in the annual parker/gentry award for conservation biology of the field museum of natural history.several plant species have been named after gentry , including : acidocroton gentryi , citharexylum gentryi , crossothamnus gentryi , eleutherodactylus gentryi , hedyosmum gentryi , metalepis gentryi , palicourea gentryi , phyllanthus gentryi , sobralia gentryi and zamia gentryi , as well as a bird , herpsilochmus gentryi . in several instances , gentry had been involved in the collection of the type specimens of these plants .

emma markovna lehmer ( née trotskaia ) ( november 6 , 1906 – may 7 , 2007 ) was a mathematician known for her work on reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory . she preferred to deal with complex number fields and integers , rather than the more abstract aspects of the theory .


== biography ==
she was born in samara , russian empire , but her father 's job as a representative with a russian sugar company moved the family to harbin , china in 1910 . emma was tutored at home until the age of 14 , when a school was opened locally . she managed to make her way to the usa for her higher education .
at uc berkeley , she started out in engineering in 1924 , but found her niche in mathematics . one of her professors was derrick n. lehmer , the number theorist well known for his work on prime number tables and factorizations . while working for him at berkeley finding pseudosquares , she met his son , her future husband derrick h. lehmer . upon her graduation summa cum laude with a b.a . in mathematics ( 1928 ) , emma married the younger lehmer . they moved to brown university , where emma received her m.sc . , and derrick his ph.d. , both in 1930 . emma did not obtain a ph.d. herself . most universities had nepotism rules which prevented husband and wife from both holding teaching positions , although emma claimed there were many advantages to not holding a ph.d .
the lehmers had two children , laura ( 1932 ) and donald ( 1934 ) .


== contributions ==
lehmer did independent mathematical work , including a translation from russian to english of pontryagin 's book topological groups . she worked closely with her husband on many projects ; 21 of her 56 publications were joint work with him . her publications were mainly in number theory and computation , with emphasis on reciprocity laws , special primes , and congruences .
paul halmos , in his book i want to be a mathematician : an automathography , wrote about lehmer 's translation of pontryagin 's topological groups : `` i read the english translation by mrs. lehmer ( usually referred to as emma lemma ) ... `` . several later publications repeated halmos ' reference to reinforce the significance of lehmer 's translation .

gramlich graduated from williams college in 1961 and received a master 's degree in 1962 and a ph.d. in economics in 1965 from yale university . he joined the federal reserve as a research economist from 1965-1970 , and was a senior fellow at the brookings institution from 1973-1976 . he then taught economics and public policy at the university of michigan from 1976 to 1997 , including a term as dean of the gerald r. ford school of public policy , and returned to michigan as a professor in 2005 .
he was appointed to the federal reserve system by president bill clinton in 1997 and resigned in august 2005 . for much of his term , he was the chair of the board 's committee on consumer and community affairs .
he was also the chairman of the air transportation stabilization board , which was created by congress after the 9/11 attacks raised concerns about the survival of the u.s. airline industry . gramlich had also chaired several other lesser-known stabilization boards created by congress . in an april 2003 speech to the national economists club , he concluded that such boards are an ineffective way to help struggling industries because of the time it takes before help arrives and because the industries that are in need of help often have far deeper problems that the stabilization boards can not fix .
“ if congress wants to bail out an industry in a hurry , it should bail it out . it takes time to act in this program , which means it 's probably not a good program for [ emergency ] scenarios ” , gramlich told the club .
gramlich was also formerly the chairman of the neighborhood reinvestment corporation and was seen as an expert on subprime lending after his years as a banking regulator at the federal reserve .
gramlich had other government experience as well , serving as chairman of the quadrennial advisory council on social security from 1994 to 1996 and as deputy director , and then acting director , of the congressional budget office in 1986-1987 . he also conducted research in 1992 on the economics of major league baseball and wrote a popular textbook on benefit-cost analysis that is in its second edition .
gramlich highlighted the problems with subprime mortgages prior to the 2007-09 financial crisis . his book , `` subprime mortgages : america 's latest boom and bust `` ( 2007 ) isbn 978-0877667391 was published before the crisis was widely recognized and he had spoken out about them earlier .

henri begleiter ( september 11 , 1935 in nimes , france – april 6 , 2006 in long island , ny ) was a neurophysiologist and distinguished professor of psychiatry
and neuroscience at suny downstate medical center in brooklyn . he was a leader in the nascent field of biomedical alcohol research in the
1970s , postulating alcoholism as a brain disorder . he founded and headed the world-renowned neurodynamics laboratory at suny downstate medical
center , brooklyn , which has been renamed in 2007 into the 'henri begleiter neurodynamics laboratory ' .
the highlights of begleiter ’ s career include the ground breaking finding published in science that some neurophysiological anomalies in alcoholics were
already present in their young offspring before any exposure to alcohol and drugs . these seminal findings led henri to propose a model that changed
the thinking in the field : namely , that rather than being a consequence of alcoholism , this underlying neural hyperexcitability was a predisposing
factor leading to the development of alcoholism and related disorders . this innovative study was replicated throughout the world and launched him on
a systematic search to elucidate the genetic vulnerability underlying a predisposition toward alcoholism and related disorders .
in 1990 , with his foresight and charismatic leadership , henri begleiter was instrumental in assembling scientists in various domains to organize the
large collaborative studies on genetics of alcoholism — coga , which he has led since its inception . under his leadership , with a strong
emphasis on novel approaches such as using brain oscillations as endophenotypes , coga has successfully identified several genes involved in the
predisposition to develop alcoholism and related disorders , and this approach is still state-of-the-art today .

rudolf spanner ( born 17 april 1895 in metternich bei koblenz ; died 31 august 1960 ) was director of the danzig anatomical institute during world war ii . on his own initiative , he set up a process to produce soap from human fat in 1943-44 and a limited quantity of the soap was produced on his order to clean autopsy rooms.during the nuremberg trials , sigmund mazur , a laboratory assistant at the danzig anatomical institute , testified that soap had been made from corpse fat , and claimed that 70 to 80 kg ( 154-176 lbs ) of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than 25 kg ( 55 lbs ) of soap , and that the finished soap was retained by professor rudolf spanner . eyewitnesses included british pows who were part of the forced labor that constructed the camp , and dr. stanislaw byczkowski , head of the department of toxicology at the danzig school of medicine . suggested sources for the fat include stutthof concentration camp , danzig municipal jail , and a danzig psychiatric hospital . the total of `` human soap `` produced by rudolph spanner is estimated at `` somewhere between 10 and 100 kilograms `` `` aaron breitbart , a senior researcher at the simon wiesenthal center , agreed that the evidence is thin . 'the leading scholars of the holocaust are of the opinion that the nazis did not make soap , ' he says . 'it was a cruel rumor at the camps . ' '' . holocaust survivor thomas blatt , who investigated the subject , found little concrete documentation and no evidence of mass production of soap from human fat , but concluded that there was indeed evidence of experimental soap making .

= karl christian planck =
karl christian planck ( january 17 , 1819 – june 7 , 1880 ) was a german philosopher .


== life ==
planck was born in stuttgart . he studied at tübingen , where he became doctor of philosophy in 1840 and privatdozent in 1848 . during this period the influence of reiff led him to oppose the dominant hegelianism of the time .
in 1850-1851 he published his great book , die weltalter , in which he developed a complete original system of philosophy , based on the realistic view that thought should proceed from nature to the highest forms of existence in the spiritual life . not only did planck oppose the idealism of his confreres ; his views were , in another aspect , directly antagonistic to the darwinian theory of descent , which he specifically attacked in wahrheit und flachheit des darwinismus ( nördlingen , 1872 ) .
the natural consequence of this individuality of opinion was that his books were practically disregarded , and planck was deeply incensed . the ill success of die weltalter nerved him to new efforts , and he repeated his views in katechismus des rechts ( 1852 ) , grundlinien einer wissenschaft der natur ( 1864 ) , seele und geist ( 1871 ) , and numerous other books , which , however , met with no better fate . in the meantime he left tübingen for ulm , whence he came finally to the seminary of maulbronn . he died in 1880 in an asylum after a short period of nervous prostration .
after his death a summary of his work came into the hands of k. köstlin ( author of aesthetics , 1869 ) , who published it in 1881 under the title testament eines deutschen , philosophie der natur und der menschheit . planck 's views were elaborately developed , but his method of exposition told heavily against their acceptance . he regarded himself as the messiah of the german people .
beside the works above quoted , he wrote system des reinen idealismus ( 1851 ) ; anthropologie und psychologie auf naturwissenschaftlicher grundlage ( 1874 ) ; a political treatise , bismarck : süddeutschland und der deutsche nationalstaat ( 1872 ) ; and logisches causalgesetz und natürliche zweckmäßigkeit ( 1874 ) .

angelo mosso ( 30 may 1846 – 24 november 1910 ) is the 19th century italian physiologist who invented the first neuroimaging technique ever , known as 'human circulation balance'.mosso began by recording the pulsation of the human cortex in patients with skull defects following neurosurgical procedures . from his findings that these pulsations change during mental activity , he inferred that during mental activities blood flow increases to the brain . remarkably , mosso invented the 'human circulation balance ' , only recently rediscovered , to non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity also in healthy subjects : this is therefore regarded as the first neuroimaging technique ever , forerunner of the more refined techniques of fmri , and pet.he was born in turin , studied medicine there and in florence , leipzig , and paris , and was appointed professor of pharmacology ( 1876 ) and professor of physiology ( 1879 ) at turin . he invented various instruments to measure the pulse and experimented and wrote upon the variation in the volume of the pulse during sleep , mental activity , or emotion . in 1900–01 he visited the united states and embodied the results of his observations in democrazia nella religione e nella scienza : studi sull ' america ( 1901 ) . in 1882 he founded with emery the archives italiennes de biologie , in which journal most of his essays appeared . among his other works are :

= william froude =
william froude ( ; 28 november 1810 in devon – 4 may 1879 in simonstown , south africa ) was an english engineer , hydrodynamicist and naval architect . he was the first to formulate reliable laws for the resistance that water offers to ships ( such as the hull speed equation ) and for predicting their stability .


== biography ==

froude was born at dartington , devon , england , the son of robert froude , archdeacon of totnes and was educated at westminster school and oriel college , oxford , graduating with a first in mathematics in 1832 .
his first employment was as a surveyor on the south eastern railway which , in 1837 , led to brunel giving him responsibility for the construction of a section of the bristol and exeter railway . it was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track transition curves and introduced an
alternative design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at rewe and cowley bridge junction , near exeter . during this period he lived in cullompton and was vicar 's warden at st andrew 's church from 1842 to 1844 . he organised , and paid a large amount to the rebuilding of the chancel and other restoration work . he also offered to pay to restore the nave if local people would pay 10 % of the cost but this offer was refused . on completion of the bristol to exeter line in 1844 he left the town.at brunel 's invitation froude turned his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the institution of naval architects became influential in ship design . this led to a commission to identify the most efficient hull shape , which he was able to fulfil by reference to scale models : he established a formula ( now known as the froude number ) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls . he built a sequence of 3 , 6 and ( shown in the picture ) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws ; raven 's sharp prow followed the `` waveline `` theory of john scott russell , but swan 's blunter profile proved to offer lower resistance . his experiments were vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the admiralty and as a result the first ship test tank was built , at public expense , at his home in torquay . here he was able to combine mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still followed today.in 1877 , he was commissioned by the admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines . he invented and built the world 's first water brake dynamometer , sometimes known as the hydraulic dynamometer , which led to the formation of heenan & froude ltd in birmingham.while on holiday as an official guest of the royal navy he died in simonstown , south africa , where he was buried with full naval honours .
he was the brother of james anthony froude , a historian , and hurrell froude , writer and priest . william was married to catherine henrietta elizabeth holdsworth , daughter of the governor of dartmouth castle , mercantile magnate and member of parliament arthur howe holdsworth .

born in barbania , a comune near turin in the kingdom of piedmont-sardinia , drovetti later obtained the french nationality and joined the grande armée . as an official , during the french campaign in egypt ( 1798–99 ) he distinguished himself by saving the life of joachim murat , and later he became the french consul-general of egypt during both the empire ( until 1814 ) and the bourbon restoration , between 1820 and 1829 . he also earned wāli muhammad ali 's trust and had a role in some of the latter 's administrative reforms . in 1820 he was awarded the title of chevalier dans l'ordre de la legion d'honneur.during his stay in egypt , drovetti became a passionate and avid collector of egyptian antiquities . he engaged several agents and was particularly active in luxor ; shortly he gathered huge amounts of findings which he managed to sell in europe . his first collection was refused by france , but was acquired by king charles felix of sardinia in 1824 and carried to turin , where it became the first core of the future museo egizio . another collection was purchased by king charles x of france and is now stored at the louvre . a third one was acquired by karl richard lepsius in 1836 and carried in prussia in order of being accommodated in the egyptian museum of berlin . among the antiquities sold to the king of sardinia there was the invaluable turin royal canon , a papyrus bearing a list of several pharaohs which is datable to the reign of ramesses ii and which was found by drovetti at luxor in 1820 .
later in his life , drovetti lost his mind and was confined in a lunatic asylum at turin . he died there in march 5 , 1852 .


== legacy ==
while he contributed significantly to the creation of three of the largest egyptological collections in europe and substantially increased the european interest in ancient egypt , drovetti is also remembered for his ruthlessness towards other collectors and excavators . he was particularly hostile against henry salt , giovanni battista belzoni and jean-françois champollion : for example , during his excavations at luxor around 1818 and later , belzoni reported to have been harassed by two of drovetti 's agents , antonio lebolo and a certain rosignani ; drovetti also tried several times to hinder champollion 's expedition in egypt ( 1827–28 ) , likely to prevent a competitor in his affairs . drovetti and his agents were also deemed careless and unscrupulous in their conduct towards their discoveries , and it is believed that the fragmentary state of the turin royal canon is at least partially due to this behavior .


== in popular culture ==
drovetti was portrayed by joseph long in the 2005 bbc docudrama egypt .

== biography ==
prior to receiving his m.d . riddell found himself in marietta , ohio to study with dr. hildreth of marietta college . as there were not many opportunities for a paid lecturer or a trained botanist he put out 'advertisements in local newspapers ' publicizing that he would collect plants for sale . he eventually published , in the western republican , one of the first botanical collections made in ohio by a professional botanist . the specimens were donated to marietta college and the hildreth herbarium . the collection was not adequately preserved and has been destroyed but the lists themselves remain.he lectured in ogdensburg , new york , and then in philadelphia and cincinnati . from 1836 until his death in 1865 , he was professor of chemistry at the medical college of louisiana ( now tulane university ) in new orleans . while there , he invented the first practical microscope to enable binocular viewing of objects through a single objective lens . in 1850 , he also undertook one of the earliest and most extensive american microscopic investigations of cholera.riddell published a science fiction story giving an account of a fictional former student named orrin lindsay , who traveled to the moon and mars.following his botanical explorations of texas , he was appointed melter and refiner of the new orleans mint , a position confirmed by president john tyler following an internal mint dispute . he likewise was appointed postmaster of new orleans , which position he held even during the civil war despite confederate appointments intended to displace him.active in local and state politics , he seems to have claimed to have been elected governor of louisiana in november , 1863 and sworn in by a justice of the peace in january , 1864 . during this time the military governor george f. shepley was still in actual power . his governorship was rejected in the course of a congressional inquiry into a contested election in the house .

laspeyres is mainly known today for his 1871 development of the index number formula method for determining price increases , used for calculating the rate of inflation . a type of this calculation is known today as the laspeyres index . in addition to his accomplishments in price indices , laspeyres may be counted as one of the fathers of business administration as an academic-professional discipline in germany , and as one of the main unifiers of economics and statistics by “ developing ideas which are today by and large nationally and internationally reality : quantification and operationalization of economics ; expansion of official statistics ; cooperation of official statistics and economic research ; and integration of the economist and the statistician in one person . ” ( rinne 1983 ) in economics , laspeyres was to some extent a representative of the historical school and certainly of kathedersozialismus .
the surname laspeyres is of gascon origin ; his ancestors were huguenots who settled in berlin in the 17th century . how he pronounced his surname is uncertain , but likely as `` las-pay-ress `` .

jorge reinel ( c. 1502 – after 1572 ) born in lisbon was a portuguese cartographer and instructor in cartography , son of the well-known cartographer pedro reinel . in 1519 in seville he participated in the maps designed for the trip of his countryman ferdinand magellan , and his depiction of the maluku islands served as a basis for spanish claims to the islands . he had trained many pupils in the art of cartography such as portuguese diogo ribeiro .


== biography ==
son of expert portuguese cartographer pedro reinel , he went to spain after a fight with a priest named pero anes . there he participated in the preparations for the trip of his countryman ferdinand magellan and for this reason he was in seville in 1519 . it was there that his father came seeking for him to return to portugal , but jorge could not return before finishing a map and a globe that he had undertaken to do , and so pedro helped him .
the location of the maluku islands in these charts was the reason of the dispute between portugal and spain : reinel maps were used to support the claims of the crown of castile to the spice-producing molucca islands , claiming that the islands were located in their domains by the treaty of tordesillas . he has also produced maps of the west coast of africa , the north atlantic , the south atlantic . scholars think that reinel , after getting into trouble in lisbon in the early 16th century and fleeing to spain , made the first map of the world .
in portugal , jorge reinel served king john iii of portugal as a master of charts and needles ( compass ) , having been granted an annual pension of 10 reais starting in 1528 .

after the treaty of tilsit in 1807 , the kingdom of prussia lost about half of its territory , including all territory west of the elbe . this prompted hayne to return to berlin in 1808 . from 1811 he taught at the university of berlin as a lecturer in botany , and in 1814 he was appointed extraordinary professor . after many years of teaching , he was appointed professor of pharmaceutical botany in 1828 . in addition to his lecturing duties he led many botanical excursions . he was known for using precise terminology in his plant descriptions .

= pasquier quesnel =
pasquier quesnel ( 14 july 1634 – 2 december 1719 ) was a french jansenist theologian .


== life ==
he was born in paris , and , after graduating from the sorbonne with distinction in 1653 , he joined the french oratory in 1657 . there he soon became prominent ; he took a leading part in scholarly controversy , for example against joseph anthelmi.his jansenist sympathies led to his banishment from paris in 1681 , following the formulary controversy . he took refuge with the friendly cardinal coislin , bishop of orléans ; four years later , however , foreseeing that a fresh storm of persecution was about to burst , he fled to brussels , and took up his abode with antoine arnauld .
there he remained till 1703 , when he was arrested by order of the archbishop of mechelen . after three months imprisonment he made a highly dramatic escape , and settled at amsterdam , where he spent the remainder of his life . after antoine arnauld 's death in 1694 quesnel was generally regarded as the leader of the jansenist party ; and his réflexions morales sur le nouveau testament played almost as large a part in its literature as jansen 's augustinus itself .
as its title betokens , quesnel 's book was a devotional commentary on the new testament , wherein quesnel managed to explain the aims and ideals of the jansenist party better than any earlier writer had done ; and it accordingly became the chief object of jesuit attack . it appeared in many forms and under various titles , the original germ going back so far as 1668 ; the first complete edition was published in 1692 . the papal bull unigenitus , in which no fewer than 101 sentences from the réflexions morales were condemned as heretical , was obtained from clement xi on 8 september 1713 . quesnel died at amsterdam in 1719 .
unigenitus marked the end of catholic toleration of jansenist doctrine . the bull unigenitus , dated 8 september 1713 , was produced with the contribution of gregorio selleri , a lector at the college of saint thomas , the future pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas , angelicum , fostered the condemnation of jansenism by condemning 101 propositions from the réflexions morales of quesnel as heretical , and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of jansen .

= august kundt =
august adolf eduard eberhard kundt ( german pronunciation : [ ˈaʊɡʊst ˈkʊnt ] ; 18 november 1839 – 21 may 1894 ) was a german physicist .


== biography ==
kundt was born at schwerin in mecklenburg . he began his scientific studies at leipzig , but afterwards went to berlin university . at first he devoted himself to astronomy , but coming under the influence of h. g. magnus , he turned his attention to physics , and graduated in 1864 with a thesis on the depolarization of light.in 1867 he became privatdozent in berlin university , and in the following year was chosen professor of physics at the federal polytechnic institute in zurich , where he was the teacher of wilhelm conrad röntgen ; then , after a year or two at würzburg , he was called in 1872 to strasbourg , where he took a great part in the organization of the new university , and was largely concerned in the erection of the physical institute . finally in 1888 he went to berlin as successor to hermann von helmholtz in the chair of experimental physics and directorship of the berlin physical institute . he died after a protracted illness at israelsdorf , near lübeck , on 21 may 1894 .


== assessment ==
as an original worker , kundt was especially successful in the domains of sound and light . in 1866 , he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes , based on the fact that a finely divided powder , lycopodium for example , when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air , tends to collect in heaps at the nodes , the distance between which can thus be ascertained . an extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases . this experimental apparatus is called a kundt 's tube . in 1876 at strasbourg in collaboration with emil warburg , kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas . in light , kundt 's name is widely known for his inquiries in anomalous dispersion , not only in liquids and vapours , but even in metals , which he obtained in very thin films by means of a laborious process of electrolytic deposition upon platinized glass . he also carried out many experiments in magneto-optics , and succeeded in showing what faraday had failed to detect , the rotation under the influence of magnetic force of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.very interesting work was performed by kundt on plant physiology and chlorophyll light frequencies absorption ( kundt 's rule ) , centred on wavelengths of 6800 å . this work may or may not have been complementary to e. warburg work and theories . it was subsequently refined and expanded by r. houston and o. biermacher and others .

= eric lenneberg =
eric heinz lenneberg ( 19 september 1921 – 31 may 1975 ) was a linguist and neurologist who pioneered ideas on language acquisition and cognitive psychology , particularly in terms of the concept of innateness .
he was born in düsseldorf , germany . ethnically jewish , he left nazi germany because of rising nazi persecution . he initially fled to brazil with his family and then to the united states where he attended the university of chicago and harvard university . a professor of psychology and neurobiology , he taught at the harvard medical school , the university of michigan in ann arbor and cornell university and medical school .
lenneberg 's 1964 paper `` the capacity of language acquisition , `` originally published in 1960 , sets forth seminal arguments about the human-specific biological capacity for language , which were then being developed in his research and discussions with george a. miller , noam chomsky , and others at harvard and mit , and popularized by steven pinker in his book , the language instinct . he presents four arguments for biological innateness of psychological capacities , parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits :

universal appearance of a trait at a single time across a species . `` species typical `` traits .
universal appearance across time for a group . not just an artifact of cultural history . again , `` species typical `` diagnostic feature .
no learning of the trait is possible .
individual development of a trait rigidly follows a given schedule regardless of the particular experience of the organism.in his publication biological foundations of language he advanced the hypothesis of a critical period for language development ; a topic which remains controversial and the subject of debate . lenneberg 's biological approach to language was related to developments such as the motor theory of speech perception developed by alvin liberman and colleagues at haskins laboratories and also provided historical antecedents to issues now emerging in embodied philosophy and embodied cognition .
lenneberg reargued extensively against the psychological implications of the work of edward sapir and benjamin lee whorf , specifically in regards to the idea that language influences thought . lenneberg 's argument against this notion was that 'linguistic and non-linguistic events must be separately observed and described before they can be correlated . '


== affiliations ==
lenneberg was quite involved in the scientific community , as he was a member of phi beta kappa , sigma xi , the linguistic society of america , the american psychological association , the society for research in child development , and the american association for the advancement of science .


== education ==
he attended primary school in düsseldorf , germany until 1933 , when he moved to brazil . in 1949 , he received a b.a . from the university of chicago . lenneberg then went on to earn a ph.d. in psychology and linguistics from harvard in 1956 .

== works ==
the chicago-lambeth quadrilateral had its genesis in an 1870 essay by huntington . in the church idea , an essay toward unity huntington 's goal was to establish `` a basis on which approach may be by god 's blessing , made toward home reunion , `` i.e . , with the roman catholic and orthodox churches . the quadrilateral is a four-point articulation of anglican identity , often cited as encapsulating the fundamentals of the communion 's doctrine and as a reference-point for ecumenical discussion with other christian denominations . the four points are :

the holy scriptures , as containing all things necessary to salvation ;
the creeds ( specifically , the apostles ' and nicene creeds ) , as the sufficient statement of christian faith ;
the dominical sacraments of baptism and holy communion ;
the historic episcopate , locally adapted.the quadrilateral has had a significant impact on anglican identity since its passage by the lambeth conference . the resolution came at a time of rapid expansion of the anglican communion , primarily in the territories of the british empire . as such , it provided a basis for a shared ethos , one that became increasingly important as colonial churches influenced by british culture and values , evolved into national ones influenced by local norms .
huntington also wrote :

conditional immortality ( 1878 )
the book annexed : its critics and its prospects ( 1886 )
short history of the book of common prayer ( 1893 )
a national church ( 1898 )

== life and work ==
the research group which he headed at unc was regularly attended by harry upshaw , jack brehm , kurt back , and edward e. jones . he is best known for `` a social psychology of groups `` , co-authored by his long-time collaborator harold kelley .
the examination of social exchange led thibaut and kelley to develop social exchange theory , a process which was facilitated by thibaut spending a year at the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences where he had significant interaction with kenneth arrow .
the early variations of social exchange theory stem from alvin ward gouldner 's ( 1960 ) norm of reciprocity , which argues that people ought to return benefits given to them in a relationship . peter m. blau built on the work done by george c. homans in exchange and power in social life ( 1964 ) . later modifications to this theory focus attention on relational development and maintenance rules ( see murstein et al . ) .
thibaut 's later research was in the area of procedural justice , where he co-authored a book with legal expert laurens walker .

== biography ==
davidov was the son of a physician from courland governorate . his elder brother august davidov was a noted mathematician and educator , and his nephew alexei davidov also became cellist and composer and also a businessman .
in his youth davidov studied mathematics at moscow state university , and then pursued a career as a composer , studying with moritz hauptmann at the leipzig conservatory . he became a full-time cellist in 1850 while continuing to compose in his spare time . he later became head of the st petersburg conservatory . he had many students , including aleksandr verzhbilovich .
in 1870 count wilhorsky , a patron of the arts , presented davydov with a stradivarius cello constructed in 1712 . this cello , now known as the davidov stradivarius , was owned by jacqueline du pré until her death and is currently on loan to cellist yo-yo ma .
he intended to write an opera on the subject of mazeppa . viktor burenin wrote a libretto for this purpose in 1880 , but when davidov proved unable to find the time to compose , burenin offered the libretto to tchaikovsky .
although closely associated with tchaikovsky , karl davidov was not related to the davydov clan into which tchaikovsky 's sister alexandra married . davidov died in moscow on 26 february 1889 . anton arensky dedicated his first piano trio to davydov 's memory .

= george madeira =
george david madeira ( october 1836 – january 1922 ) was a mining engineer and mineralogist who founded the first astronomical observatory in california in the town of volcano .
madeira arrived with his family from illinois in volcano on august 30 , 1852 . they , like many others , had come in search of gold during the california gold rush . he had been interested in astronomy as a child , reporting to have observed a comet in february , 1843 . although his formal education had ended at age 15 , he continued to study mathematics from a neighbor , a methodist minister from british columbia named telerand .
in 1860 , he set up a crude observatory consisting of his telescope ( which he had delivered from san francisco ) , and a heavy canvas and oilcloth covering . on october 18 of that year , the sacramento daily union published a letter from him ( under a pseudonym ) regarding sunspot activity , the earliest recorded publication of astronomical research in california . on june 30 , 1861 , he observed a large and bright comet , which was later dubbed the great comet of 1861 ( unbeknownst to him , it had already been discovered by australian john tebbutt over a month earlier , but news of the discovery had not reached the northern hemisphere yet ) . the family left volcano for carson city , nevada in 1862 and madeira sold his telescope to josiah whitney of the california geological survey .
in addition to his recorded observations , madeira made another important contribution to astronomy . he was a paid lecturer even as a young man , taking his telescope around the state . after one such lecture in 1860 in san jose attended by james lick , he and lick spent the next few nights observing the skies at lick 's estate . at one point , madeira told lick , `` if i had your wealth , mr. lick , i 'd build the world 's largest telescope on top of that mountain , `` pointing out a spot where the present lick observatory sits . although he was not the only influence , he was probably the first to suggest to lick the idea of a large telescope .
madeira went on to a varied career as a mining geologist , mineralogist ( he was curator of the california mineral exhibit at the 1904 world 's fair in st. louis , missouri ) , journalist , prospector , and mining consultant . he never lost his interest in astronomy and he wrote many articles on aspects of astronomy for the newspapers he worked at . at one point , he applied for a position at lick observatory when it opened , but in this he was not successful .

miguel kast rist ( december 18 , 1948 - september 18 , 1983 ) was a german-born chilean economist of the chicago boys group . he was most known for his role in public policies , where he promoted a greater focus of resources toward the needy.upon getting his master in economics at university of chicago , miguel kast joined odeplan ( 1973 ) , the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973 . at odeplan , miguel kast focused most of his energies on creating the `` map of extreme poverty `` , which would become the cornerstone of chile 's social development programs . in 1978 he became the head of odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join odeplan and by sending them to the country 's outer regions to get insight into the real problems of chile .
in 1980 miguel kast became labor minister under the military dictatorship of augusto pinochet and in 1982 he became governor of the central bank of chile .
this was a complicated moment in chile 's economy ; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and chile 's big economic groups had liabilities with their own banks . as a central banker he worked to reduce the level of related loans ( loans made to the owners of the banks ) . he also created a mechanism called the `` portfolio sale `` through which the central bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks . by keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar , miguel kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars . however the central authority saw it otherwise and on june 13 , 1982 decided to devalue the peso . this brought a sharp loss of international reserves and miguel kast decided in august 1982 to completely free exchange rate thus further devaluing the peso and bringing a new intervention from the central authority . under this new threat of instability , miguel kast resigned from the central bank .
only few months after his resignation , in january 1983 , miguel kast learned he had bone cancer . he died on september 18 of the same year .
in recognition of miguel kast 's work , the atlas economic research foundation created an award named after him to recognise the latin american think tank which has made the most important contribution to help reduce poverty.two of his relatives are involved in politics too : his younger brother josé antonio , and one of his children , felipe .

later , he headed the scientific side of r14 , the division working on optical character recognition for postal mechanisation , which moved to the new bt research centre at martlesham in suffolk . his work on pattern recognition led to the development of an early postcode-reading machine .
he frequently lectured on pattern recognition using the concept of multi-dimensional space , and the 'caltrop ' , and would demonstrate the presence of feature-detection in the human visual system by means of a flash gun , the persistence of vision in the audience leading them to observe disintegration of a character fragment by fragment . 'doc ' coombs was notable for a facial 'tic ' , which gave him something of the appearance of the 'mad professor ' , and these days would probably be classed under tourette 's syndrome .

baron de blonay was for a time one of the closest confidants of the ioc 's legendary second president pierre de coubertin . when de coubertin joined the french army in 1916 de blonay became acting president of the ioc . a little bit earlier , when de coubertin nearly ran out of money and took a back seat , de blonay had been appointed to run an international olympic executive committee , in lieu of the president . however , it has been suggested that he somehow upset de coubertin by over-stretching the powers of this committee and it was this that may have caused him , surprisingly , not to have been chosen to succeed as the third ioc president in 1925 .

carlos thays ( august 20 , 1849 – january 31 , 1934 ) was a french-argentine landscape architect , and a student of french landscape architect édouard andré .


== biography ==
born jules charles thays in paris , france in 1849 , carlos thays arrived in argentina in 1889 , after he was recommended by jean alphand to argentine pioneer miguel crisol , who contracted thays to design sarmiento park in córdoba . during his time in córdoba thays became infatuated with the young country and decided to spend the rest of his life in argentina . after moving to buenos aires he was named the city 's director of parks & walkways in 1891 . this position gave him significant influence over the design of the city 's open spaces , and his legacy is still strongly felt in the city 's open spaces today .
major projects included tree planting along streets , remodeling and designing public plazas and walkways as well as designing completely new parks and expanding older ones . major parks and plazas that particularly show thays influence on buenos aires include the parks centenario , lezama , patricios , barrancas de belgrano and the plazas constitución , congreso , and mayo . thays ' french heritage is reflected in many of his designs , in so far that buenos aires ' parks and plazas are often compared to similar designs in paris .
one of thays ' largest undertakings was the parque tres de febrero , a sweeping area of open land covering several square kilometers filled with thousands of trees , flowers , many fountains , and monuments in the barrio of palermo .
a pet project of his was the buenos aires botanical garden , for which he petitioned the city government to set aside land ( almost 8 hectares ) , which he designed in sections to display plants organised by continent , with a large section devoted to the native plants of argentina , which were ignored in garden-making at the time . the garden has the first ginkgo biloba planted in argentina . completed in 1898 , it bears his name , the jardín botánico carlos thays de la ciudad autónoma de buenos aires . one greenhouse , was first erected at the paris exposition of 1889 and brought in sections from france to be reassembled , one of five in the garden . a brick house in the english gothic revival style , in which he lived during the construction and planting of the garden , now houses the herbarium and a small botanical library .

while thays worked primarily in buenos aires throughout the years he also worked on many civic projects in other areas of argentina , remodeling the parque sarmiento ) , córdoba , designing the parque urquiza in parana , entre rios , parque 9 de julio in san miguel de tucumán , the parque de la independencia in rosario , and the parque san martin in mendoza . thays also designed the grounds of the luxurious club hotel de la ventana , near sierra de la ventana in buenos aires province . work outside argentina included the urban planning of the residential neighborhood of carrasco , aid in the planning of the parque rodó , and the design of the plaza cagancha and plaza independencia in montevideo , uruguay.thays worked most extensively in buenos aires precisely at a period in the city 's history where it was growing extremely fast as a result of immigration , especially from spain and italy . it is often noted that had thays not insisted on high standards of design and frequent open spaces , many of the city 's current open spaces would probably not exist .
next to the perito francisco moreno and other prominent figures founded july 4 , 1912 boy scouts association of argentina .
thays died in buenos aires in 1934 .

he described blastocystis hominis and entamoeba dispar . the latter species helped to explain why most people who appeared to be infected with entamoeba histolytica were asymptomatic . however , because there are no morphological differences between the two species , his proposal was largely ignored for over 50 years before being proven correct using molecular techniques.the french academy of sciences awarded him the prix savigny for 1910 . a number of parasitic species bear his name , including plasmodium brumpti and xenocoeloma brumpti . also , a genus of phlebotomine sand flies , brumptomyia , and a species of corsican mosquito , culex brumpti , are named after him .
brumpt 's best known written work is précis de parasitologie , which was published in six editions between 1910 and 1949 . he was the author of many scientific papers , including several on the anopheles mosquito and its relationship to malaria . he was the president of the société zoologique de france in 1922 . with maurice neveu-lemaire and maurice langeron , he founded in 1923 the parasitological journal annales de parasitologie humaine et comparée , now continued as parasite .

nikolai semyonovich golovanov ( russian : никола́й семёнович голова́нов , nikoláy semyónovich golovánov ) ( [ o.s . 9 ] 21 january 1891 – 28 august 1953 ) , pau , was a soviet conductor and composer , who was married to the soprano antonina nezhdanova .
he conducted the premiere performances of a number of works , among them nikolai myaskovsky 's sixth symphony in may 1924.golovanov held some of the highest musical positions in the ussr , including an extensive association with the bolshoi opera . in her autobiography , galina vishnevskaya terms him the theater 's chief conductor , and tells of his dismissal from the bolshoi and his death - which she attributed to the humiliation of the experience of losing this position . it has been reported that golovanov 's firing was the result of stalin 's displeasure at golovanov 's having tried to use a jewish singer , mark reizen , in the title role of tsar boris godunov in his recording of mussorgsky 's opera . golovanov actually did record the opera with reizen as boris , but later remade reizen 's part with another boris , alexander pirogov .
golovanov 's recorded output was substantial and quite individual in interpretive approach . in his discography we find all but one of the liszt tone poems , the complete scriabin symphonies and piano concerto , tchaikovsky 's first and sixth symphonies , as well as shorter works , beethoven 's first symphony , violin concerto and triple concerto , rimsky-korsakov 's scheherazade and his operas sadko and christmas eve , mussorgsky 's boris godunov and pictures at an exhibition , rachmaninoff 's second and third symphonies , the opera aleko and other compositions , glazunov 's fifth , sixth and seventh symphonies , and scores by grieg , mozart and others . based upon the evidence of his recordings , golovanov 's characteristic performance mode was full-blooded and nearly vehement in tone , with a powerful , almost overloaded sense of sonority , and extreme flexibility in matters of tempo , phrasing and dynamics .
in addition to audio recordings by golovanov , there is extant visual representation of his conducting style . possibly during the second world war , evidently intended as a morale booster , there was produced a film of golovanov conducting a group called the ussr state symphony orchestra in a performance of the tchaikovsky `` 1812 overture . `` as was the practice in the ussr , the tsarist anthem was replaced in the score with the chorus `` glory , glory to you , holy russia ! `` from glinka 's `` a life for the tsar . `` the film does not feature synchronous sound , and concerns itself primarily with various soviet functionaries , military figures and orthodox priests ( ! ) in the audience ; however , the short segments of golovanov conducting show an energetic but physically spare conducting style , one seemingly at odds with the sometimes extreme nature of his interpretations .
golovanov was also a composer ; his works include the opera `` princess yurata `` , a symphony and other orchestral works as well as choral music .

johann conrad brunner ( 16 january 1653 – 2 october 1727 ) was a swiss anatomist , especially cited for his work on the pancreas and duodenum .


== life ==
brunner was born in diessenhofen , and studied medicine in schaffhausen , strasbourg , amsterdam , london and paris . at schaffhausen he studied under johann jakob wepfer ( 1620–1695 ) , who was also his father-in-law . he received his doctorate in 1672 from the university of strasbourg . beginning in 1686 he was a professor of anatomy and physiology at the university of heidelberg . in 1716 , brunner was appointed personal physician to charles iii philip the new elector of the palatinate . he received many accolades during his life including a knighthood with the title `` brunn von hammerstein `` . he died in 1727 in mannheim , germany .


== work ==
brunner is remembered for his experiments and studies of the pancreas and the internal secretions associated with that organ . in 1683 he removed the pancreas from a dog and noticed that the animal experienced extreme thirst and polyuria . despite his intuitive grasp of the connection between the pancreas and diabetes , he was unable to provide a theoretical link for the role of the pancreas in that disease . he published his findings on pancreatic research in a treatise titled experimenta nova circa pancreas . accedit diatribe de lympha & genuino pancreatis usu .
in 1687 he described tubuloalveolar glands in the submucous layer of the duodenum , which were later named brunner 's glands . two disorders associated with these glands are :

`` brunner 's gland hyperplasia `` : hypertrophy of brunner 's glands in the submucosal layer of the duodenum .
`` brunner 's gland adenoma `` : polyp-like tumours arising from brunner 's glands .

gibbs graduated from yale and johns hopkins in 1929 . he was offered a fellowship in neuropathology by stanley cobb , of harvard medical school . he studied epilepsy in the same laboratory as william g. lennox and erna leonhardt .
erna leonhardt was lennox 's technical co-worker and had come to boston as an immigrant from germany . [ 1 ] she married gibbs in 1930 and they formed a research team that would last a lifetime , publishing papers together over the next fifty-odd years .
the electroencephalograph was primitive in the early 1930s , having only one channel . in 1935 , gibbs asked albert grass ( an mit graduate ) to build a 3-channel eeg . grass built the machine in his father 's basement with the help of his brother . in the same year , erna and frederic gibbs travelled to europe to attend a conference and visit hans berger , the inventor of the eeg . [ 2 ] in 1944 , they moved to university of illinois school of medicine , and frederic gibbs was promoted to professor in the epilepsy clinic .
the gibbs published the book `` atlas of electroencephalography `` in 1941 , with a second edition in 1951 . their book valued the subjective and experienced eye of an electroencephalographer over objective mechanical or mathematical analysis . [ 3 ] frederic gibbs was jointly ( with william lennox ) awarded the albert lasker award for clinical medical research in 1951 .

manuel carlos prado y ugarteche ( april 21 , 1889 – august 15 , 1967 ) was a banker who served twice as president of peru . son of former president mariano ignacio prado , he was born in lima and served as the nation 's 50th ( 1939 - 1945 ) and 54th ( 1956 - 1962 ) president . his brother , leoncio prado gutiérrez , was a military hero who died in 1883 , six years before manuel prado was born .
as a young army officer , prado was a key player in the coup that overthrew peruvian president guillermo billinghurst in 1914 . he became president of the central reserve bank in 1934 .
manuel prado , a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family , reached the presidency of peru with the help of the left-wing alianza popular revolucionaria americana party . prado announced that `` one of the first acts of my government will be to declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties . ``
during prado 's second presidency ( 1956–1962 ) , the only significant proscribed party was the apra ( american popular revolutionary alliance ) , which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by president manuel odría . prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected congress a bill to legalize apra once again . the bill was later passed and the apra 's famed founder , víctor raúl haya de la torre , returned from foreign exile .
in foreign policy , prado – whose greatest pride was that as president in 1942 he made peru the first of the south american nations to break off relations with the axis powers– was expected to side firmly with the u.s . there is documentary evidence that shows that prado 's enthusiastic support of the deportation of peruvians of japanese descent to the united states during world war ii was motivated by a desire to rid peru of all of its japanese-descended residents—a charge which some historians have argued amounted to a campaign of ethnic cleansing .

fabrizio mordente ( salerno , 1532 – ca 1608 ) was an italian mathematician . he is best known for his invention of the `` proportional eight-pointed compass `` which has two arms with cursors that allow the solution of problems in measuring the circumference , area and angles of a circle . in 1567 he published a single sheet treatise in venice showing illustrations of his device .


== life and career ==
fabrizio mordente was born in salerno , italy , and studied at the università di napoli . after completing his studies at the age of 20 , he set out to see the world . he left naples in 1552 and visited crete , cyprus , egypt , palestine and mesopotamia . after reaching the persian gulf , he took a portuguese ship to india . he stayed in goa for three years and then continued his voyage around the cape of good hope , eventually arriving in lisbon . he went from there to paris and visited other european cities before returning to italy and visiting venice , florence and rome . during this trip he drafted the initial design for his compass.based on the success of his design , mordente took service in 1571 at the court of emperor maximilian ii in vienna . from 1578 he served in prague at the court of rudolph ii , to whom he dedicated an edition of anversa in 1584 . in prague , he also met michiel coignet and giordano bruno , who used the compass to refute aristotle 's hypothesis on the incommensurability of infinitesimals , thus confirming the existence of the `` minimum `` which was the basis of his atomic theory . bruno published the dialogues mordentius and de mordentii circino which praised mordente , but also presented criticisms that raised protests from the mathematician . mordente replied in 1586 and bruno responded with the satires idiota triumphans and de somnii interpretatione . after mordente gained support in the dispute from the french charles , duke of guise , bruno was forced to flee paris .
after this controversy , mordente took service with the duke of guise until his death . in 1591 mordente returned to italy and entered the service of alexander farnese , duke of parma , where he published his last mathematical treatise .

= pierre victor auger =
pierre victor auger ( 14 may 1899 – 25 december 1993 ) was a french physicist , born in paris . he worked in the fields of atomic physics , nuclear physics , and cosmic ray physics . he is famous for being one of the discoverers of the auger effect , named after him .


== early life ==
pierre 's father was chemistry professor victor auger . pierre auger was a student at the école normale supérieure in paris from 1919 to 1922 , the year when he passed the agrégation of physics . he then joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the faculté des sciences of the university of paris under the direction of jean perrin to work there on the photoelectric effect .


== career ==
in 1926 he obtained his doctorate in physics from the university of paris . in 1927 , he was named assistant to the faculté des sciences of paris and , at the same time , adjoint chief of service to l'institut de biologie physico-chimique . chief of work to faculty in 1934 and general secretary of the annual tables of the constants in 1936 , he was named university lecturer in physics to the faculty on the first of november 1937 . he was charged with , until 1940 , the course on the experimental bases of the quantum theory within the chair of theoretical physics and astrophysics . he was also adjoint director of the laboratory of physical chemistry . he then occupied the chair of quantum physics and relativity of the faculté des sciences of paris .
at the end of world war ii , he was named director of higher education from 1945 to 1948 , which permitted him to introduce the first chair of genetics at the sorbonne , conferred upon boris ephrussi .
the process where auger electrons are emitted from atoms is used in auger electron spectroscopy to study the elements on the surface of materials . this method was named after him , despite the fact that lise meitner discovered the process a few years before in 1922 .


== findings ==
in his work with cosmic rays , he found that the cosmic radiation events were coincident in time meaning that they were associated with a single event , an air shower . he estimated that the energy of the incoming particle that creates large air showers must be at least 1015 electronvolts ( ev ) = 106 particles of 108 ev ( critical energy in air ) and a factor of ten for energy loss from traversing the atmosphere .


== honors and achievements ==
he was european space research organisation ( esro ) first director general and one of the forefathers for the cern foundation.he was president of the centre international de calcul ( rome ) . from 1948 to 1959 , he directed at unesco the department of mathematical and natural sciences.he was elected a member of the académie des sciences in 1977 .
he hosted a broadcast of popularization of exacting science on friday evenings on the public radio station france culture from september 1969 to june 1986 , entitled les grandes avenues de la science moderne.the world 's largest cosmic ray detector , the pierre auger observatory , is named after him .
