ludwig borchardt ( october 5 , 1863 – august 12 , 1938 ) was a german egyptologist who was born in berlin . he is best known for finding a famous bust of nefertiti at amarna .


== life ==

also known as herbert , borchardt initially studied architecture and later egyptology under adolf erman . in 1895 he journeyed to cairo and produced , with gaston maspero , the catalogue of the egyptian museum ( catalogue général du musée du caire ) .his main focus was ancient egyptian architecture . he began excavations in amarna , where he discovered the workshop of the sculptor thutmose . amongst its contents was the famous bust of nefertiti , ( now in the neues museum in berlin ) . from 1902 until 1908 , he undertook extensive excavations of the pyramid of sahure , exploring the entire mortuary complex . he published his discoveries in a two-volume study das grabdenkmal des konigs sahure , `` the funerary monument of the king sahure `` , which is still considered the standard work on sahure 's complex.borchardt married emilie ( mimi ) cohen , one of the daughters of eduard cohen and ida kuhn . in 1903 , mimi received an inheritance from her grandfather abraham kuhn of 150,000 marks , a considerable fortune equal to 53.7 kilograms of gold , and spent most of it on buying a villa in cairo.in 1907 borchardt founded the german archaeological institute ( deutsches archäologische institut ) in cairo , and remained its director until 1928 . while based in cairo , he also directed the excavations in heliopolis and the noble tombs of the old kingdom in abu gorab . he died in zürich on august 12 , 1938 .
recently , controversy has arisen with the assertion that borchardt smuggled the bust of nefertiti out of egypt by reporting it as an artifact made of gypsum . however , the swiss art historian henri stierlin has claimed that the bust is a copy dating from 1912 .

== early life and education ==
hendrick was born in kirkby , in 1868 , into a family of musicians . his father , henry lewis hendrick , was a music teacher . he studied composition and music in glasgow and at the musica mathematica college in edinburgh where he studied under charles bain , with whom he was lifelong friends . in 1876 he became first in his class to obtain a first class in music . he then returned to scotland to attend the conservatorium of music in lisburn , where his father continued to instruct students . he then enrolled at the university of glasgow , where he was influenced by the experimental and the thinking of percy bysshe shelley and the st. john of the cross school of scots , which pioneered the teaching of classical music .


== career ==
the biographer john grey , who knew hendrick and his family well , recollects : `` that hendrick had a distinctive voice was recognised long before the word ever filtered out of his lips . his syllables [ were ] pitch sensitive , and his phrasing would suggest one pitch of the way to distinguish between the words of musical thought . even at this early stage , he understood what shelley , in his two earliest plays , meant by that word 'heart '' '.initially he was taught by lewis macfarlane . in 1911 hendrick took a university course in classical singing ( at that time called horn singing ) under george taylor and was an expert horn-singing student , until being offered an invitation to join the girton museum , the university of london 's geological research unit . although he was not a great amateur horn player , he acquired the skills needed for the task . he trained in the field under dr. charles bain in the summers of 1906 and 1909 . at girton hendrick was first to build a life-size model of sir thomas herriot 's geological epigraph for his son , the geologist james herriot . the grave marker at girton also reads `` l.h . dreyfuss `` .

in 1912 hendrick became the curator of the geological society of london . he was also active in the `` corps for the protection of mammals and birds `` , the public advisory council for the forest reserve , and was made an honorary fellow of the royal geological society of london in 1910.hendrick retired from the geological society in 1915 , having made an `` earnest effort to give to science the basic measures of science as a distinct science `` . in 1917 hendrick returned to girton , where he continued to work in the museum until his retirement in 1920 . he taught zoology to the boys at girton . he served on the geological society 's committee on entomology in 1932-1935 and on the geological research committee in 1937-1940 . hendrick lived for a time at mount head , a popular recreation .
hendrick and his wife clara moved to the english countryside in 1919 and lived at irmin nambour in athlone , where he dedicated his life to the protection of public birds . in 1937 his work was recognised by the wildlife trust of great britain.he died at girton , in his native gartown , on 19 october 1943 .

oleksandr konstantinovich preobrazhensky ( russian : николай андре́й андрович новной , ; 20 october 1902 – 15 april 1987 ) was a soviet geologist .


== biography ==
preobrazhensky was born on 20 october 1902 in besansky , ukraine , into a family of prominent men in the banking industry . he attended besansky gymnasium ( russian : пергелогич кунса ) , where he was a student of vladimir sedevik . his father eduard preobrazhensky was the leading banker and an influential member of the soviet elite . another son , oleg preobrazhensky was also a leading figure in the banking industry , and , like his father , was a patriarch in the besansky community . at besansky , oleksandr spent his early years getting a normal education . his second year he went to besansky polytechnic institute to study philosophy . when preobrazhensky graduated from besansky , he chose to continue his education at an extremely elite departmental institution , the department of geology of the department of metallurgy . at that time , geology was a sub-specialty , which made it almost impossible to find an excellent candidate for that particular field . moreover , there was a significant degree of skepticism among western scientific societies . even the relatively conservative american geologist robert louis stevenson had not accepted the accepted field of geology . nonetheless , his experience and professional interests in the subject were quite well known within the u.s.a. as a result , preobrazhensky was recommended to the director of the metallurgy department , alexander n. baker . in 1944 , the government of the soviet union gave preobrazhensky the rank of major general and promoted him to major general . in 1945 , he became a vice-president of the ussr academy of sciences .
preobrazhensky left besansky for leningrad in 1949 , just before the soviet government was launched into full democracy . he arrived in leningrad at the height of the summer soviet working week , in the midst of the great patriotic war , and on a busy time-frame . preobrazhensky had spent several months as a soviet deputy foreign minister at the united nations . during this period , he worked closely with the first soviet geologist of geological sciences , alexander landov . through this foundation of knowledge , which lasted for a number of years , he produced several major contributions in the field of paleontology and stratigraphy . he was particularly known for his groundbreaking `` geological survey of the ussr `` , which covered many areas of the soviet geology . he was awarded a presidential commendation for his pioneering work . from 1950 until 1960 he was director of the metallurgy department of the state geodetic service . in 1959 , the geological institute of the ussr awarded him the royal geographical society 's j.d . benson gold medal , as it is considered to be the most prestigious academic award awarded by the u.s. geological survey .
from 1964 until his death in 1987 , preobrazhensky was the head of the geological survey of the ussr . he was one of the first representatives of geology in the united states . between 1963 and 1972 , he was the director of the geological survey of the ussr . he was often seen lecturing in engineering and technology courses in the united states , and on various other occasions in europe.he was also an important conservationist . the life-size figurine of preobrazhensky was dedicated to the summer labor day commemorations . it was placed in the plouform museum of the leningrad state university .

== early life and education ==
jaffa was born into a jewish family to bethe and roy . he was educated at a yeshiva , hebrew university , and then studied at the hebrew university of jerusalem under the supervision of leopold kronecker , a german mathematician . in 1936 , jaffa was awarded a phd in mathematics , at the age of 19 , following a lecture by john von neumann . later that year , he married doris nessa ramzan , a mathematics phd student . the ramzanes later moved to the united states .

in 1936 , jaffa moved to montreal , canada , where he studied at the university of montreal under professor alexis van rooyen . in 1938 , at the age of 20 , jaffa was a member of a team led by van rooyen and giuseppe tosi in montreal , quebec , canada . this team was led by leonard j. kaptchuk , who taught at the university of arizona in tucson . in 1941 , van rooyen and jaffa joined the max planck institute for theoretical physics in hamburg , germany , where the research focused on electron and proton collisions in metals . in 1944 , with the help of richard feynman , john von neumann , fermi and jaffa proposed a unified approach to what is now called high-energy physics . they set out to measure the energy at the sub-photon level in the earliest theoretical particles . this was done using a method called the feynman–jaffa-poisson experiment ( fjp ) , also called the field field planck experiment . their calculations predicted the theoretical lowest energies , that is , the lowest energy states of the smallest known elementary particles ( the letters f , w and z ) , using the external frame of reference for the planck measurement.their results were important in the field of high energy physics , as it was believed that they supported the atomic model of nuclear fission . at that time , they also proposed that c=n=0 . in this , they were followed by other groups , including max planck , who formulated a fission model in 1961 . other groups with their efforts on this and other high-energy problems included the bohr group , the geiger–loeffler group and the liouville group . in 1945 , at the age of 29 , jaffa , along with eugene wigner , max born , and andrei sakharov were inducted into the national academy of sciences . in the same year , jaffa moved to , and helped to lead the preparation of , the geiger-loeffler-radcliffe–bell curve . this work is related to the prediction of the feynman–jaffa field in 1947 . these early calculations are still cited in today 's semiconductor technology , such as cmos and laser junction technologies . jaffa was president of the american physical society from 1942 to 1943.in 1948 , jaffa became the mathematics department chair at the university of california , berkeley , where he was instrumental in developing the two-dimensional electronic instrument ( vel , early electronic code computer ) , known as the virvan . in 1953 , he was named head of the institute 's special projects division , which was the youngest department in the university 's history .


== later life and death ==
in 1966 , at the age of 63 , jaffa died at berkeley from cancer , which he had caught a few months earlier . he was survived by his daughter , ruth , and his son , jonathan jaffa . he is buried in cypress , california , along with his doctoral student , arthur p. batchelder .

in 1939 hollaender published research showing that the mutations of spores of the ringworm fungus occurred in the same spectrum as the absorption spectrum of nucleic acids indicating that nucleic acids form the building blocks of genes . a young esther m. zimmer , who worked with dr. hollaender at the u. s. public health service ( bethesda , md ) , published with dr. hollaender and milislav demerec in this very early field of x-ray- and uv-induced mutations . later on , esther m. zimmer ( now esther lederberg ) became one of the most influential founders of bacterial and bacteriophage ( lambda ) genetics . later on , hollaender worked at oak ridge national laboratories with m. laurance morse , who himself later went on to collaborate with esther lederberg .
his research was not appreciated for its discovery at the time , and later scientists reports were necessary before science accepted the role of nucleic acids as the genetic material . historians of science now realize his early discovery , and his fermi award recognized this discovery.in 1981 hollaender established the council for research planning in biological sciences , and was its president at the time of his death from a pulmonary embolism in 1986 . the us national academy of sciences gives the alexander hollaender award in biophysics every three years in his honor .

in die religion ( kantner verlag , 1888 ) , hertz drew a comparison between the pelagian doctrines of thomism and mysticism , arguing that although they were inspired by faith , their `` dogmatic grounds `` had `` deeper intellectual underpinnings `` , such as the being of god in christ.in die religion ( wien , 1894 ) , the philosophic focus of the work was on thomism and ethics .
in die religion ( leipzig , 1898 ) , , hertz attempted to suggest a teleology . he argued that theology as a discipline can begin from `` as deistic an internal sense of individuality and its generative theme `` as `` the reflection and propagation of an indivisible ontological or philosophic state `` .in die religion ( wien , 1900 ) , he defended an ontological argument for prescience . according to this claim , when we know a thing , the knowledge gives us knowledge of god , the positing of which originates in prior knowledge .

= james six =
james six frs ( 1731 – 25 august 1793 ) was a british scientist born in canterbury . he is noted for his invention , in 1780 , of six 's thermometer , commonly known as the maximum- minimum thermometer . this device is still in common use today and widely sold in garden centres .


== life ==
six was from a family of refugees from the continent who had settled in england in the reign of queen elizabeth i , and who had worked as silk weavers for generations . james six himself had trained in the family business , but by his time this was in decline because of cheap imported silks from india and persia .
he became interested in natural philosophy , and devoted himself to astronomy and meteorology . in 1782 the royal society of london published an account of the thermometer that six had invented two years earlier . he became a fellow of the royal society in 1792 , his election was the result of this and other papers he had published on meteorology .
in 1783 he performed a number of thermometrical measurements on canterbury cathedral in conjunction with sir john cullum , who wrote about them for philosophical transactions in “ account of extraordinary frost , 23 june 1783 ” , ( philosophical transactions , lxxiv ( 1784 ) ) .
six wrote about his invention in his book , the construction and use of a thermometer for showing the extremes of temperature in the atmosphere , during the observer 's absence , together with experiments and variations of local heat ; and other meteorological observations . this was published posthumously in london , in 1794 , a year after he died .
james six died on 25 august 1793 at the age of sixty-two . his wife mary died on 19 march 1801 and they are buried together in a vault in westgate church , canterbury .

william joseph oswald ( july 6 , 1919 – december 8 , 2005 ) was an american educator , scientist , and engineer who spent his entire academic career at the university of california , berkeley in the departments of civil and environmental engineering and public health . he made foundational contributions to the fields of wastewater treatment and applied phycology , or as he called it , `` algology `` . throughout a career spanning more than five decades , oswald was the primary academic advisor to more than two dozen doctoral students , sat on more than 100 additional masters and doctoral thesis committees , and taught seminal courses in applied algology .


== early life , military service , and education ==
oswald was born in king city , california in 1919 . he grew up on a ranch in that area , where the arid climate stoked his interest in water supplies , wastewater treatment , and water use . in world war ii , he served in the army air forces and was responsible for water safety at one of the d-day invasion camps . oswald remained in the army in europe after the war , working in a hospital where he cared for patients suffering from waterborne ailments and met his lifelong wife , an american nurse . returning home to california , he obtained a degree in civil engineering from the university of california , berkeley in 1950 on the g.i . bill . he then continued his studies and was awarded an m.s . ( 1951 ) and ph.d. ( 1957 ) in sanitary engineering , biology and public health . oswald joined the faculty of the university the same year and went on to become a full professor in 1970 . he remained in the position his entire career , staying on as an emeritus professor after his retirement .


== career ==
oswald studied the role of algae in wastewater treatment as a student , winning recognition from the american society of civil engineers for his early work . he continued investigating the use of microalgae in sanitation throughout his career , developing strategies for combining engineered algae ponds to obtain specific water treatment goals . he developed the `` high rate pond system `` of shallow , mixed raceway ponds to maximize algae productivity . this design is still in use today , responsible for over 90 % of the world 's commercial microalgae production . his work led to the development of the `` advanced integrated wastewater pond system `` , in which wastewater flows through a series of ponds , starting with deeper `` facultative `` ponds , then high rate ponds , and finally maturation ponds . the research undertaken by oswald and his students and collaborators provided the foundations for much of modern microalgae wastewater treatment technology . wastewater treatment plants based on his designs operate throughout the world today.with broader implications in energy and nutrient cycles , oswald ’ s work often crossed over into related fields such as waste energy recovery , biofuels , animal feeds , and waste nutrient reuse . the air force ’ s interest in waste and nutrient recycling for long term space missions led to oswald ’ s development of the algatron–a device that would grow microalgae on astronaut waste , treating water and also producing oxygen and food.an archive of oswald 's work is maintained by former student and long time collaborator tryg lundquist , now a professor of environmental engineering at cal poly , san luis obispo .


== awards and honors ==
oswald was recognized throughout his career . he received the harrison prescott eddy medal in 1953 from the water pollution control federation ( now known as the water environment federation ) for describing photosynthetic oxygenation . the american society of civil engineers awarded him both the rudolf hering medal and the james croes medal in 1957 for work describing the fixation of nutrients and capture of solar energy by microalgae and the arthur m. wellington award in 1966 for various investigations of life support systems for extended space travel . in 2005 he was awarded the lifetime achievement prize of the international society for applied phycology and in 2006 he was nominated for the stockholm water prize .

in 1880 , after finishing his studies in mathematics , physics and medicine , he became an assistant to physiologist friedrich goltz ( 1834-1902 ) at the university of strasbourg . in 1900 he succeeded goltz as chair of physiology at strasbourg , a position he maintained until 1918 .
ewald is best remembered for his research of the vestibular system of the inner ear , which largely involved experiments performed on the semicircular canal system of pigeons . from these studies the so-called `` ewald laws `` are derived , which deal with the effects of endolymph motion on body , head and eye movements and also on the phenomena of excitation-inhibition asymmetries in the vestibular system .
ewald 's first law : `` the axis of nystagmus parallels the anatomic axis of the semicircular canal that generated it `` .
ewald 's second law : `` ampullopetal endolymphatic flow produces a stronger response than ampullofugal flow in the horizontal canal `` .
ewald 's third law : `` ampullofugal flow produces a stronger response than ampullpetal flow in the vertical canals ( anterior and posterior semicircular canals ) .in 1892 he was given an award by the paris academy of sciences for his monograph `` physiologische untersuchungen über das endorgan des nervus octavus `` .

friedrich adolph wilhelm diesterweg ( 29 october 1790 – 7 july 1866 ) was a german educator , thinker , and progressive liberal politician , who campaigned for the secularization of schools . he is said to be precursory to the reform of pedagogy .


== biography ==

educated at herborn and tübingen universities 1808-1811 , diesterweg began teaching in 1811 . he taught at mannheim and at worms for about two years , and then moved to the model school in frankfurt am main . later he became rector of the latin school of elberfeld . in 1820 , he was appointed director of the new teacher 's seminary at mörs where he put in practice the methods of pestalozzi . in 1832 , he was summoned to berlin to direct the new state-schools seminary in that city . here he proved himself a strong supporter of nonsectarian religious teaching . in 1846 , he established the pestalozzi institution at pankow , and the pestalozzi societies for the support of teachers ’ widows and orphans . because of his disagreement with the authorities regarding important phases of higher education he was in constant friction and resigned from the seminary in 1847 . in 1850 , he received a government pension . thereafter , he continued to vigorously advocate his educational ideas through the medium of periodicals . in 1858 , he was elected to the chamber of deputies as member for the city of berlin , and voted with the liberal opposition .


== philosophy ==
diesterweg thought criticalness and responsibility were important in teaching , and sought to reform social , economic and moral aspects of education publishing the influential pädagogisch wollen und sollen . he based his program on what was named the `` basic principles of the struggle for life `` that he saw in the catholicism/protestantism conflict . he thought there were several 'oppositions ' ( distinct choices ) that were available in the conflict which could be reduced to a single `` authority or freedom , catholicism or protestantism `` .

in his effort to reform schooling diesterweg wanted to remove political and religious influence in the teaching itself and instead involve more of a social factor . he believed in the availability of education : `` first educate men , before worrying about their professional training or class , [ because ] the proletarian and the peasant should both be educated to become human beings `` ; he also believed that through education the poor could be helped . he wanted professionalization of state teachers and fought for the relative autonomy of schools ; he also had an influence on the teachers of that time through his newspaper rheinisch blätter .


== works ==
diesterweg was a voluminous writer on educational subjects , and was the author of various school text-books . he authored 50 books and published about 400 papers ; he has been credited with originated the phrase 'learn to do by doing ' by one source .
in 1851 , he founded the pädagogisches jahrbuch ( yearbook of pedagogy ) in berlin . among his publications were :

wegweiser zur bildung für deutsche lehrer ( guide for the instruction of german teachers ; 2 vols . , 1834 ; 6th ed . , 1 vol . , 1890 )

the term netizen is a portmanteau of the words internet and citizen , as in a `` citizen of the net `` or `` net citizen . `` it describes a person actively involved in online communities or the internet in general.the term commonly also implies an interest and active engagement in improving the internet , making it an intellectual and a social resource , or its surrounding political structures , especially in regard to open access , net neutrality and free speech . the term was widely adopted in the mid-1990s as a way to describe those who inhabit the new geography of the internet . internet pioneer and author michael f. hauben is credited with coining and popularizing the term .


== quotations from michael and ronda hauben ==
hauben describes the distinction to internet users in general by saying :


== in china ==

in chinese , the terms wǎngmín ( 网民 , literally `` net-people `` ) and wǎngyǒu ( 网友 , literally `` net-friend `` ) are commonly used terms meaning `` internet users `` , and the english word netizen is used by mainland china-based english language media to translate both terms , resulting in the frequent appearance of that english word in media reporting about china , far more frequently than the use of the word in other contexts .


== the netizen prize ==

the international nonprofit organisation reporters without borders awards an annual netizen prize in recognition to an internet user , blogger , cyber-dissident , or group who has helped to promote freedom of expression on the internet . the organisation uses the term when describing the political repression of cyber-dissidents such as legal consequences of blogging in politically repressive environments .

edwin cannan ( 3 february 1861 , funchal , madeira – 8 april 1935 , bournemouth ) , the son of david cannan and artist jane cannan , was a british economist and historian of economic thought . he was a professor at the london school of economics from 1895 to 1926 .
as a partisan of jevonianism , edwin cannan is perhaps best known for his logical dissection and destruction of classical theory in his famous 1894 tract a history of the theories of production and distribution . although cannan had personal and professional difficulties with alfred marshall , he was still `` marshall 's man `` at the lse from 1895 to 1926 . during that time , particularly during his long stretch as chairman after 1907 , edwin cannan shepherded the lse away from its roots in fabian socialism into tentative marshallianism . this period was only to last , however , until his protégé , lionel robbins , took over with his more `` continental `` ideas .
though cannan , in his early years as an economist , was a critic of classical economics and an ally of interventionists , he moved sharply to the side of classical liberalism in the early 20th century . he favored a simplicity , clarity , and common sense in the exposition of economics . according to geoffrey m. hodgson , cannan `` emphasised the institutional foundation of economic systems `` .

in 1918 , dr. cooke suggested a mechanism of action for allergen injections as a `` desensitization or hyposensitization , `` analogous to tolerance achieved in experimental anaphylaxis induced in animals . this concept suggested that the injections of an increasing amount of allergen or antigen slowly neutralized those antibodies responsible for the allergic reaction .

giovanni maria lancisi ( 26 october 1654 – 20 january 1720 ) was an italian physician , epidemiologist and anatomist who made a correlation between the presence of mosquitoes and the prevalence of malaria . he was also known for his studies about cardiovascular diseases , and is remembered in the eponymous lancisi 's sign .


== biography ==
giovanni maria lancisi ( latin name : johannes maria lancisius ) was educated at the collegio romano and the university of rome , where he qualified in medicine aged 18 . he was physician to popes innocent xi , clement xi and innocent xii . he was given the lost anatomical plates of bartolomeo eustachius by pope clement xi ; these were made in 1562 and had been forgotten in the vatican library . lancisi edited and published them in 1714 as the tabulae anatomicae . he studied epidemiology , describing malaria and influenza epidemics . he published de noxiis paludum effluviis ( on the noxious effluvia of marshes ) in 1717 , in which he recognized that mosquito-infested swamps are the breeding ground for malaria and recommended drainage of these areas to prevent it . he also published extensively on cardiology , describing vegetations on heart valves , cardiac syphilis , aneurysms and the classification of heart disease . his landmark de motu cordis et aneurysmatibus was published posthumously in 1728.early in the 18th century , lancisi had protested the medieval approaches to containing rinderpest in cattle by stating that `` it is better to kill all sick and suspect animals , instead of allowing the disease to spread in order to have enough time and the honour to discover a specific treatment that is often searched for without any success `` ( mantovani and zanetti , 1993 ) . lancisi who made the first breakthrough in the control of rinderpest ( lancisi , 1715 ) , a procedure that was later adopted by thomas bates ( bates , 1718 ) .
however , lancisi also erred , as he disputed the work of giovanni cosimo bonomo ( 1663-1696 ) , his contemporary , who had correctly identified the cause of scabies as a parasite . lancisi however felt scabies was of humoral origin . because of lancisi ’ s powerful position and , because previous scientists like galileo galilei had fallen into disgrace , bonomo was silenced and his discovery was forgotten until the modern era .


== brain & soul inquiries ==
lancisi described the corpus callosum as the `` seat of the soul , which imagines , deliberates and judges . `` his dissertatio physiognomica provided the supporting argument in 1713 . he opposed alternative locations of the soul as hypothesized by others , such as the centrum ovale , by andreas vesalius , and the pineal gland , by rené descartes . he hypothesized that the longitudinal striae ( later named in his honor as the `` striae lancisi `` or `` nerves of lancisi `` ) were the conduit between the anterior location of the soul , and the posterior location of sensory organ functions , both within the corpus callosum .

louis berthoud ( 6 february 1790 – 29 october 1854 ) was a french philologist and philosopher .


== life ==
berthoud was born at la sarne , in the nîmes . his father was a ‘ gold-smith ’ ; his mother , marguerite berthoud , was a mathematician . he was educated in the tuileries , at the end of which his book was translated into english . in his youth he loved political economy , both in the framework of individualism and empiricism , and became an amateur economist . in 1793 , when the revolution of 1789 was still just beginning , he headed the committee for public credit , which published a pamphlet entitled “ economics and political economy . ” in addition to the influence of this publication , he was a member of the constituent assembly , which established the council of state in 1789 . in june 1789 he worked with jacob de graaff on a book on education for children entitled “ etudes physiologiques sur l ’ éducation générale . ” this work is still in print and has been translated into various languages . he went on to write what is known as the berthoud-leverist ’ – the view that the experience of childhood is a leading factor in the development of reason .
in 1803 berthoud became a member of the american philosophical society , and was promoted to full member in 1807 . he was awarded the jean de heverie medal by the british academy in 1824 . his expositions on philosophy and economics form the second and third volumes of his three-volume treatise on the subject . one of his pupils was the painter frederick strahan . he was elected to the french academy in 1816 and served for one term as rector of the faculty of philosophy at paris . in 1823 he was elected to the académie française , and was made a member the following year . in 1833 he was the first member of the english academy of sciences . his final publication was des études de l ’ l ’ école d'econometrique sur l ’ a du cantique du politique et l ’ a du pédagogie , and of his history of the french intellectual life.he died on 29 october 1854 in paris , leaving behind a wife and five children .

ernst carl gerlach stueckelberg ( baptised as johann melchior ernst karl gerlach stückelberg , full name after 1911 : baron ernst carl gerlach stueckelberg von breidenbach zu breidenstein und melsbach ; 1 february 1905 – 4 september 1984 ) was a swiss mathematician and physicist , regarded as one of the most eminent physicists of the 20th century . despite making key advances in theoretical physics , including the exchange particle model of fundamental forces , causal s-matrix theory , and the renormalization group , his idiosyncratic style and publication in minor journals led to his work being unrecognized until the mid-1990s .


== early life ==
born into a semi-aristocratic family in basel in 1905 , stueckelberg 's father was a lawyer , and his paternal grandfather a distinguished swiss artist . a highly gifted school student , stueckelberg initially began a physics degree at the university of basel in 1923 .


== career ==
while still a student , stueckelberg was invited by the distinguished quantum theorist arnold sommerfeld , to attend his lectures at the university of munich . he went on to gain a ph.d. on cathode physics in 1927 . later that year he went to princeton university , becoming an assistant professor in 1930 .
he returned to switzerland in 1932 , working first at the university of basel before switching the following year to the university of zurich . in 1934 he moved again to the university of geneva , which together with the university of lausanne became his principal bases for the rest of his career .
stueckelberg 's sojourn in zurich led to contact with leading quantum theorists wolfgang pauli and gregor wentzel , which in turn led him to focus on the emerging theory of elementary particles .
in 1934 he devised a fully lorentz-covariant perturbation theory for quantum fields . the approach proposed by stueckelberg was very powerful , but was not adopted by others at the time , and has now been all but forgotten . however , besides being explicitly covariant , stueckelberg 's methods avoid vacuum bubbles.stueckelberg developed the vector boson exchange model as the theoretical explanation of the strong nuclear force in 1935 . discussions with pauli led stueckelberg to drop the idea , however . it was rediscovered by hideki yukawa , who won a nobel prize for his work in 1949 — the first of several nobel prizes awarded for work which stueckelberg contributed to , without recognition.in 1938 stueckelberg recognized that massive electrodynamics contains a hidden scalar , and formulated an affine version of what would become known as the abelian higgs mechanism . he also proposed the law of conservation of baryon number.the evolution parameter theory he presented in 1941 and 1942 is the basis for recent work in relativistic dynamics .
in 1941 he proposed the interpretation of the positron as a positive energy electron traveling backward in time.in 1943 he came up with a renormalization program to attack the problems of infinities in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , but his paper was rejected by the physical review.in 1952 he proved the principle of semi-detailed balance for kinetics without microscopic reversibility.in 1953 he and the mathematician andré petermann discovered the renormalization group.in 1976 he was awarded the max planck medal.his phd students included marcel guénin .

= ingeborg beling =
ingeborg beling was a german ethologist from the early 20th century who worked in the field of chronobiology . she studied at the university of munich under the direction of karl von frisch and is known for her research on the time sense of honey bees .
in her research , in 1929 , she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day , day after day . this contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees ’ 24-hour biological clock . because of this achievement , she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists . beyond honeybees , much of beling ’ s work involved studying behaviors of wasps , fly pupae , etc . finally , she also did some research in pest control .


== bee-feeding experiment ( 1929 ) ==
beling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper , titled `` über das zeitgedächtnis der bienen `` ( “ on the time memory of bees ” ) published in the journal of comparative physiology , that the early observations of forel , v. buttel-reepen and dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees , termed zeitgedächtnis , or time memory . in her pioneer experiments , beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish , which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day ( for example , between 4 and 6 pm ) . during the testing phase , the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded . she found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time , even when the sugar water was removed . specifically , beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning . further more , she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day , and even for multiple times a day . however , beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours , but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested . these results were still present when beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity , temperature , light and radiation .


== contributions to chronobiology ==
beling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time . she found that this time memory is both rigorous ( the bees consistently show up at the expected time ) and flexible ( the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day , even two or three times a day ) . beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours . this 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous , helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day . the bees ' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day , the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response . beling ’ s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments .


== related terms ==
much of the early work in chronobiology was done in germany , so publications were largely written in german . some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today . the father of chronobiology , colin pittendrigh , critiqued these terms , saying that researchers in munich have trouble letting go of these terms . he argues that ‘ training ’ and ‘ memory ’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior .


== related chronobiologists ==
beling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees . her work grew from the observations of previous scientists ( forel , buttel-reepen , von frisch ) and helped inspire further experimentation ( wahl , renner ) . standing on the shoulders of these researchers , pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology .

= theodor meynert =
theodor hermann meynert ( 15 june 1833 – 31 may 1892 ) was a german-austrian psychiatrist , neuropathologist and anatomist born in dresden . meynert believed that disturbances in brain development could be a predisposition for psychiatric illness and that certain psychoses are reversible .
in 1861 he earned his medical doctorate , and in 1875 became director of the psychiatric clinic associated with the university of vienna . some of his better known students in vienna were josef breuer , sigmund freud , who in 1883 worked at meynert 's psychiatric clinic , and julius wagner-jauregg , who introduced fever treatment for syphilis . meynert later distanced himself from freud because of the latter 's involvement with practices such as hypnosis . meynert also ridiculed freud 's idea of male hysteria ; though some authors believe this to be due to his own hidden suffering of the illness , prompting a reconciliation with freud near to his death . other famous students of meynert 's were russian neuropsychiatrist sergei korsakoff ( 1854–1900 ) , german neuropathologist carl wernicke ( 1848–1905 ) and swiss neuroanatomist auguste-henri forel ( 1848–1931 ) . meynert 's work was an important influence in the career of german neuropathologist paul flechsig ( 1847–1929 ) .


== brain research ==
meynert 's work was largely focused on brain anatomy , pathology and histology , including the mapping of its intricate pathways and topography . he made many contributions involving the study of the cellular architecture of the brain and is often considered to be the founder of cerebral cortex cytoarchitectonics .
meynert developed theories in regards to correlations between neuroanatomical and mental processes . he conceptualized that a coupling between one mental association and its temporal successor as a literal contact between cortical nerve cells linked to one other by nerve fibers , and a series of cortical associations could therefore be construed as being a `` train of thought `` . he also theorized that ideas and memories are to be envisioned as being attached to specific cortical cells .

in regards to mental illness , meynert conceptualized that a conflict existed between the cerebral cortex and the sub-cortical regions as the primary cause for abnormal function of cerebral components . also he formulated that a causal connection existed between cerebral pathologies and psychoses due to a lack of `` cerebral nutrition `` related to vasomotor functionality . meynert 's aim was to establish psychiatry as an exact science based on anatomy . in his 1884 textbook psychiatrie . klinik der erkrankungen des vorderhirns , meynert forewords with the statement : `` the reader will find no other definition of 'psychiatry ' in this book but the one given on the title page : clinical treatise on diseases of the forebrain . the historical term for psychiatry , i.e . , 'treatment of the soul , ' implies more than we can accomplish , and transcends the bounds of accurate scientific investigation . ``


== anatomical terms ==
he has several anatomical structures named after him , including the basal optic nucleus of meynert , the substantia innominata of meynert and `` meynert cells `` , which are solitary pyramidal cells located in the cerebral cortex near the calcarine fissure . in 1869 meynert described the dorsal tegmental decussation of the left and right tectospinal and tectobulbar tracts , located in the mesencephalon ( midbrain ) . this was to become known as `` meynert 's decussation `` or as `` fountain decussation `` .

he studied botany at the university of strasbourg with pierre-marie-alexis millardet ( 1838-1902 ) , and at the university of halle under anton de bary ( 1831-1888 ) . he earned his doctorate in 1874 , and later became an assistant to julius von sachs ( 1832-1897 ) at the university of würzburg . he was appointed an associate professor at the university of strasbourg , and after just one year , he attained the chair of botany at the university of jena in 1881 . here , he also served as director of the botanical garden .
during the winter of 1889-1890 , he took a scientific expedition to ceylon and java , and in 1894 travelled to mexico . two of his better-known students were hans adolf eduard driesch ( 1867-1941 ) and hans kniep ( 1881-1930 ) .


== botanical research ==
stahl is remembered for his pioneer experiments in the field of ecophysiology , as well as research involving the developmental history of lichens . he was able to induce the synthesis of the lichen endocarpon pusillum from spores and algal material , including formation of apothecia , and thus he made a strong experimental case for the hypothesis by simon schwendener ( 1829-1919 ) that lichens are twin fungal-algal organisms.other contributions by stahl included studies concerning the influence of light on plants — he described the anatomy of sun and shade leaves ; the effects of moisture and dryness on the formation of leaves , and the role of stomata in xerophytes and mesophytes . he conducted important research on the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and tree roots , and also worked on plant defense against snail and slug herbivory and a plethora of other botanical and ecological questions .

the following year , olabide published his translation into the basque of the medieval spiritual classic , imitation of christ by thomas à kempis , with the title of kisto'ren antz-bidea . his goal had become the publishing of translations across the entire range of the sciences , so as to advance the use of the language .
olabide , however , then made the decision to embark on a translation of the bible . the new testament took him ten years ; it was published in 1931 in bilbao . after the expulsion of the jesuits in the course of the spanish civil war , he took shelter at the franciscan sanctuary of arantzazu in oñati , where he devoted himself to the translation of the old testament . by chance , he was living in the city of guernica on 26 april 1937 when the german luftwaffe conducted its attack on the city . he was able to save his manuscripts from his residence before it was destroyed by fire and escaped to the nearby town of kanala , where he was given refuge in the rectory of the town . he then left spain and settled in toulouse , france , where he died as the result of an accident on the streets of the city.the translation on which olabide had been working at the town of his death was completed by a fellow jesuit , patxi etxeberria , who was brought back from missionary service in taiwan for this effort . it was published in 1958 .

george young ( 15 july 1777 – 8 may 1848 ) was a scottish divine , scholar and flood geologist .


== biography ==
george young was born in kirknewton south-west of edinburgh to john young and his wife jean . george was born without a left hand and this situation led his parents to educate him for the ministry.at the university of edinburgh he distinguished himself in mathematics and natural philosophy . he was a favorite student of professor john playfair who was , at that time , becoming the great promoter of james hutton 's uniformitarian geology . after receiving high honors upon completion of his degree in 1796 , he studied theology under dr george lawson at selkirk for five years , receiving at the end of this period a licence to preach from the presbytery of glasgow . in 1806 he became the pastor of the cliff street chapel in whitby where he served for 42 years . he obtained an m.a . degree from the university of edinburgh in 1819 . in 1826 he married margaret hunter . though married for 20 years they had no children .
young could read and write hebrew , greek , latin , french , and italian with some acquaintance with arabic , chaldean and syriac , and he developed his own shorthand , which is still undecipherable . he helped establish whitby museum as the first secretary and a founding member of the whitby literary and philosophical society . he procured fossil and mineral collections for the yorkshire philosophical society .
young wrote twenty-two books on many topics : inter alia , the history of whitby ; the great solar eclipse of 1836 ; an acclaimed biography of captain james cook ; the downfall of napoleon ; and , a catalog of hardy garden plants .
with john bird as artist he wrote a geological survey of the yorkshire coast in 1822 published in whitby . this book remains in print in facsimile . a second edition ( 1828 ) was printed and published in the north of england , edinburgh , and london . the second edition contains seventeen plates : numbers one to fifteen , and number seventeen , are on one page , and number sixteen is a two-page spread . the plates are hand-coloured with watercolour : brush-strokes are clearly visible . the effect is exquisite and may reflect young 's passion for geology , and bird 's art.the title was followed by scriptural geology in 1838 .
george young was immersed in fossil collecting and selling . he helped preserve preserving the yorkshire philosophical society and museum . he promoted fossil collecting saying , `` the researches of the geologist are far from being unworthy of the christian , or the philosopher : for , while they enlarge the bounds of our knowledge , and present a wide field for intellectual employment and innocent pleasure , they may serve to conduct us to the glorious being . `` r.j. cleevely stated that young `` questioned many of the facts concerning fossils , sedimentation and geological time ” of the yorkshire coast , such as the facts that the strata had been deposited by water , and that the horizontally deposited strata had become tilted by some violent force . young did not object to these facts , but to interpretations of them by contemporary geologists.on 8 may 1848 , two years after the death of his wife , george young died of influenza at the age of 71 years .

she was the first woman to take part in what became known as the `` demarcation `` of the three `` races `` of man . her work with joseph elvin shapiro made the previously one-sided nature of this `` division `` untenable . she published one of the first laws of physics in 1916 , giving a mathematical basis for the ionosphere and mesosphere . in 1918 , she proposed that the electrically charged particles responsible for aurora borealis must also be responsible for precipitation . her work was received with cautious enthusiasm in britain . in january 1919 , turner was arrested by the home office for contempt of court . as a consequence of this and later 'investigations ' , turner was arrested for having taken part in the `` league of nations `` 's conference at hanoi , along with the editors of the evening standard , the daily telegraph and the saturday mirror . this led to her being acquitted of contempt in 1924 . turner was also censured by the british press for her alleged involvement in the creation of a `` war school `` at edinburgh for black soldiers , likely using them as guinea pigs in development of machine gun sights and communication equipment .

maximilien chaudoir , or maximilien , baron de chaudoir , ( 12 september 1816 , ivnitsa , near zhitomir – 6 may 1881 , amélie-les-bains ) was a russian entomologist . he was a specialist in coleoptera and in particular the carabidae . his cicindelidae are conserved by the muséum national d'histoire naturelle in paris . his carabidae were acquired by charles oberthür ( 1845-1924 ) , then given to the same museum . he wrote mémoire sur la famille des carabiques , 6 volumes commencing 1848 .


== life and work ==
chaudoir was born in ivnitza , about 30 kilometres from jitomir , ukraine . the family may come from a line of french protestant emigrants who fled in 1685 or from belgium . the subsequent roots have been traced to antoine de chaudoire from poland whose son worked in the court of stanislas-auguste poniatowski until his abdication in 1795 after which he moved to bavaria where he received the hereditary title of baron from maximilien joseph ii in 1814 . his son stanislav ( 1790-1858 ) married aglae d'erggelet and maximilien was their only son . stanislav was a wealthy collector who donated his books and collectibles to the hermitage museum . maximilien was raised by his aunt as his mother died after his birth . jean wavre , a private tutor introduced him to natural history and insects . he began collecting carabid beetles in 1826 . he was sent to study law at tartu ( dorpat ) , although not interested in law , he knew that j.f . eschscholtz taught zoology there . unfortunately for him , eschscholtz died a few weeks before he joined the university , and chaudoir began to work on his collections at the museum . he was encouraged by count gustave de mannerheim and in 1834 he travelled around germany and met louis chevrolat in hamburg . he became a member of the entomological society of france in 1834 . he moved to kiev and then joined the societe imperiale des naturlistes de moscou in 1837 . in 1845 chaudoir visited crimea and became interested in the caucasus region . in 1847 he became a member of the entomologische verein , stettin . in 1848 he bought the faldermann collection followed by another collection of himalayan beetles from captain boys in 1850 and still later gory 's collection in 1852.he married elisabeth-augusta bockshanine on february 28 , 1856 . they had a daughter and a son . his daughter marie however died in 1879 at the age of 22 from tuberculosis . chaudoir died from a stroke on 6 may 1881 and was buried next to his daughter in their family vault at amelie-bains-palalda . his wife died in 1896 at jitomir and their son died without issue in 1919 . before his death he let his collection be available to rene oberthür through his friend charles oberthür . this collection eventually went to the muséum national d'histoire naturelle in paris .

franz von langlais ( 26 january 1635 – 21 april 1714 ) , the protestant theologian , was born in sibley , near the rhine , and went into the service of the protestant reformed church from 1654 to 1671 .


== life ==
he was the son of stephan von langlais , a teacher at the reformed gymnasium in sibley , and his wife , maria gotthilf von langlais . his father , like his mother , was a freethinker . his paternal grandfather , the priest pietro langlais , was a radical theologian and preacher in neuen artin .
at the age of six he was converted to the views of luther . he obtained a preliminary university education in sibley , and in 1655 undertook a course in theology with samuel koldenberg , whereupon he was ordained in 1658 . his degree of doctor of divinity from the university , in august 1662 , was probably due largely to his advocacy of the reformed doctrines of justification by faith , free choice , and justification by faith alone , as opposed to the calvinistic doctrines and dogmatics .


== ecclesiastical career ==
he was for some years professor of philosophy in neuen artin , and in 1662 took up the rectorate of duisburg . his theology had greatly improved , and he afterwards delivered the episcopal college sermon at the palace of gotha . he was also indefatigable in the organization of churches . in 1672 he was appointed professor of theology at the imperial university of bucharest , and a minister of the church of romania at bucharest , from which he retired in 1694 .


== works ==
his major works are the work de ibitur rectis doctrinae ( erlangen , 1694 ) , on the construction of the creed of justification , which was to become , in the course of its operations , the text of such protestant treatises as utrius melanchthon and the works of christoph schlegel .

where ε is the depth of the potential well , σ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero , r is the distance between the particles , and rm is the distance at which the potential reaches its minimum . at rm , the potential function has the value −ε . the distances are related as rm = 21/6σ ≈ 1.122σ . these parameters can be fitted to reproduce experimental data or accurate quantum chemistry calculations . due to its computational simplicity , the lennard-jones potential is used extensively in computer simulations even though more accurate potentials exist .


== explanation ==
the r−12 term , which is the repulsive term , describes pauli repulsion at short ranges due to overlapping electron orbitals , and the r−6 term , which is the attractive long-range term , describes attraction at long ranges ( van der waals force , or dispersion force ) .
differentiating the l-j potential with respect to r gives an expression for the net inter-molecular force between 2 molecules . this inter-molecular force may be attractive or repulsive , depending on the value of r. when r is very small , the molecules repel each other .
whereas the functional form of the attractive term has a clear physical justification , the repulsive term has no theoretical justification . it is used because it approximates the pauli repulsion well and is more convenient due to the relative computing efficiency of calculating r12 as the square of r6 .
the l-j potential is a relatively good approximation . due to its simplicity , it is often used to describe the properties of gases and to model dispersion and overlap interactions in molecular models . it is especially accurate for noble gas atoms and is a good approximation at long and short distances for neutral atoms and molecules .
the lowest-energy arrangement of an infinite number of atoms described by a lennard-jones potential is a hexagonal close-packing . on raising temperature , the lowest-free-energy arrangement becomes cubic close packing , and then liquid . under pressure , the lowest-energy structure switches between cubic and hexagonal close packing . real materials include body-centered cubic structures also.the lennard-jones ( 12,6 ) potential was improved by the buckingham potential ( exp-6 ) later proposed by richard buckingham , incorporating an extra parameter and the repulsive part is replaced by an exponential function :

=== networked thinking ===
vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking , a combination of cybernetic and systemic ideas and complexity . central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects , leading to emergent behavior of the system as a whole . these networks can be described by using protocols , mathematical networks , computer software , so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations , including positive and negative feedback loops . simulations of systemic networks can help to decide the long-term effects of singular measures .


=== the sensitivity model ===
vester 's sensitivity model combines these ideas , and has been used since the 1980s in studies by ford , unesco and other organizations .

robert c. woodhouse ( july 6 , 1859 – october 9 , 1944 ) was an american biologist known for his studies of fungi , plant diseases and pollination . he was a professor of botany and later director of the college of agricultural sciences in milwaukee , wisconsin .


== biography ==
woodhouse was born in 1859 to maria and hamilton woodhouse , who ran a funeral parlor . his father worked as a plumber , and his mother moved away with him to live with his family after the death of his father . he earned his bachelor 's degree from wisconsin wesleyan college , and his ph.d. in physiology from the university of wisconsin in 1908 . in 1909 , he married caroline poncelet , who was born in mexico . they moved to chicago , illinois in 1910 , where they lived for the next eight years . they would remain there for the rest of his life .


== career ==
after graduating from wisconsin wesleyan college , woodhouse went to philadelphia , pennsylvania , where he worked in zoology and biology , eventually becoming a staff research botanist and resident botanist at the university of pennsylvania . in 1916 , he was promoted to assistant professor of biology at the college , where he later became a full professor in 1919 .
in his career , woodhouse identified many plant diseases that had important role in aiding the livestock industry , and helped create a biorepository of wheat fields . during world war i , he participated in the great lakes research project , and helped develop an experimental mill and a chemical fertilizer in minnesota . from 1925 , woodhouse served as head of the department of botany at the university of wisconsin , madison , where he took over as chair from 1926 to 1938 .


== scientific achievements ==
during the first half of the 20th century , woodhouse 's work on phytotaxonomy laid the groundwork for a new approach for understanding phytotaxonomy in the western united states . woodhouse was well known for his unorthodox approach to phytotaxonomy that involved asking the questions `` what is life ? `` rather than `` what is happening ? '' . he also pursued questions like : `` is it related to the flowering times ? `` and `` what is some characteristic morphological characteristic in fungi ? `` after studying plants for decades , his work in the field of phytotaxonomy soon caught the attention of botanists around the world . he began publishing papers in an international scientific journal , american journal of botany , in 1920 , and published a series of five papers , as well as a series of articles in the proceedings of the royal society of london . he also published several papers on chemical plants . many of his published works include the first description of boulengeria mimosa . this moss , discovered in 1980 , is often referred to as `` the coleopteran of the genus woodhouse 's plants. ``
woodhouse was a pioneer of the field of flora ecology , along with aron feinberg , henry stockton-blatt and al c. milliken , and is also credited with creating the microbial fungi taxonomy . he coined the term `` microbial floras `` in 1948 , when he described the macroflora of various woody vascular plants as the coleopteran system and studied the malacological communities and feeding habits of the fungus .


== honors and awards ==
in 1924 , he received the charles babbage medal of the royal society of london .

berthold hatschek ( 3 april 1854 – 18 january 1941 ) was an austrian zoologist remembered for embryological and morphological studies of invertebrates .
he studied zoology in vienna under carl claus ( 1835-1899 ) , and in leipzig with rudolf leuckart ( 1822-1898 ) . he gained his doctorate at the university of leipzig with a dissertation titled beiträge zur entwicklungsgeschichte der lepidopteren . hatschek was deeply influenced by the works of ernst haeckel ( 1834-1919 ) .
in 1885 he was appointed professor of zoology at charles university in prague , and from 1896 was a professor and director of the second zoological institute at the university of vienna . hatschek suffered from severe depression , which greatly affected his work in the latter stages of his life.hatschek is remembered for the so-called `` trochophore theory `` , in which he explains the trochophore to be the larval form of a hypothetical organism- the `` trochozoon `` ( which in adult form corresponded to a trochophore-like rotifer , and was the suggested common ancestor of almost all bilateral , metazoan lifeforms ) .in 1888 he split frey and leuckart 's coelenterata into three phyla : spongiaria , cnidaria and ctenophora . from his research of amphioxus , the anatomical terms- `` hatschek 's pit `` and `` hatschek 's nephridium `` are derived .

= enrico barone =
enrico barone ( italian : [ baˈroːne ] ; 22 december 1859 , naples , kingdom of the two sicilies – 14 may 1924 , rome , italy ) was a soldier , military historian , and an economist .


== biography ==
barone studied the classics and mathematics before becoming an army officer . he taught military history for eight years from 1894 at the officers ' training school . there he wrote a series of influential historical military works . in these he employed a method of successive approximations to which his study in economics had introduced him . in 1902 , he became head of the historical office of the general staff . he resigned his commission in 1906 .
from 1894 he collaborated with maffeo pantaleoni and vilfredo pareto in the giornale degli economisti .


== impact ==
he was the first to state conditions under which a competitive market would be pareto efficient . he introduced variable factor proportions into neoclassical economics , contributing to the marginal-productivity theory of factor-income distribution . he extended conditions of general equilibrium in walrasian theory , suggesting the feasibility of trial-and-error movement to market equilibrium . he pioneered the economic theory of index numbers . his contributions were made without use of utility or even indifference curves .

barone has been described as a `` founder of the pure theory of a socialist economy . `` in 1908 , he presented a mathematical model for a socialist economy under which certain relations , later identified with shadow prices , must be satisfied for `` maximum collective welfare . `` the latter corresponds to least-cost-price of production from pareto efficiency reached in competitive equilibrium . he stressed that such a result could not be arrived at a priori but only by experimentation on a large scale with great demands on data collection , even assuming unchanging productive conditions . in this , he suggested that movement toward economic efficiency in a socialist economy was not inconceivable , outlining two types of socialism : a centralized and decentralized model . for such regimes , whatever the distribution rule for output and income adopted by the ministry of production , the same economic categories would reappear for prices , salaries , interest , rent , profits , saving , etc . , though perhaps with different names . his analysis , and the austrian economists ' responses , fueled discussion of the economic calculation problem and market socialism in the 1930s . his method also anticipated abram bergson 's seminal formulation of a social welfare function three decades later .

= dirk-jules dermet =
dirk-jules dermet ( also dirk jules dermett , 1888–1962 ) was a belgian-canadian mathematician , a prominent exponent of the euclidean-geometric theory , and the author of many algebraic and mathematical papers .


== life ==
dermet was born in brefeld , where his father , paul dermet , was pastor . his parents wanted him to attend the st. petersburg conservatory of music , so he studied music theory and composition under pierre rolland , but he preferred to pursue mathematics . his professor , vincenzo valchek , helped recruit him as a mathematician and professor of pure and applied mathematics . he earned his ph.d. in 1913 from johns hopkins university , where he was a fellow of the national academy of sciences . while working at johns hopkins , he assisted marcel fougère with his work on quaternions , and worked with alexander c. maurer . he was also member of the apm le comptes rendus compositionse et mathematique de france . he received the gold medal of the mathematical society of edinburgh and the first membership in the le comptes rendus compositionse . he was appointed co-secretary for the mathematical institute of the royal norwegian academy of sciences in 1944 , and his proposers were dietrich swank and lise skovgaard .


== works ==
dermet studied theorems of the norm and that are relativized to a variety of symmetric forms , and generalized principal and sum of ordinary differential equations on quaternions.he is sometimes cited as being the `` father of the euclidean calculus `` ( a variation of algebraic geometry , where euclidean geometry is a certain number of absolute terms , a starting point for all subsequent topics ) .


=== euclidean geometry ===
dermet formulated the principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives . according to haack , dermet was motivated by `` his desire to understand not only the fixed-point planes of a plane without surface or volume , but what is tangentially symmetric in a plane with both `` . his principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives allows for generalization of the differential equations of maxwell 's equations . according to d. g. smith , the mathematical proofs of these equations allow for universal extension of all mathematical theory to a third dimension .
dermet defined the `` lassen `` triangle by extending the euclidean rules to these three special case triangles . this triangle is the third most common triangle that contains a circle .


=== first-order functional analysis ===
dermet devised and extended earlier work on functional analysis , for which he is often called `` founder of functional analysis `` . it provides the foundation for the applicability of mathematical methods in functional analysis , a priority he dedicated to his collaborators leon balabanov and silvio nardi in 1931 . dermet established the basis for an understanding of the notion of linear algebra . many mathematicians in his time believed that algebraic structure is linear if and only if the basic rules governing differential equations are observed . dermet 's work demonstrates that this is false . this work was widely known at the time and proved in several papers before dermet 's death in 1962 .

william thurston addison ( 27 february 1828 – 5 february 1900 ) was an english catholic priest , sociologist and writer , often credited with originating the concepts of `` modern woman `` and `` newly modern `` .


== biography ==
addison was the son of samuel addison ( 1748–1834 ) , a cloth manufacturer , and elizabeth ( née ashton ) , daughter of the merchant benjamin ashton . in 1839 , his elder brother was elected local vicar ; a year later , a brother-in-law became vicar ; in 1842 , william moved to naples , italy , where he was vicar of pavia from 1848 until 1856 , when he was sent by the curia to rome . while there , addison wrote his first books , which advocated conversion from roman catholicism to the anglican communion ( now a separate religion ) .

addison 's interest in reforming catholicism was at the height of its renaissance in italy in the early 1840s . his denunciation of roman catholicism as `` the filth and sloth of rome `` caused the bishop of turin , massimo varese , to rebuke him , and addison 's plea for `` a definite and independent religious creed `` caused him to be included in the first of several accademia dei lincei revocati in 1844.in the following years he became an advocate of anglicanism ; his assertion that his own views were socially liberal was ridiculed , and with the conversion of the wealthy vezzano family , addison became `` dean of the civic chapel in turin , which , with its ecclesiastical privileges , makes him among the foremost authorities on modern italian literature. ``
he was a fierce opponent of the order 's separation from rome , and his idea of `` radical independence `` ( also used in english with the title `` radical protestantism `` ) , due to his opposition to rome 's ecclesiastical structures and its tendency to centralize power , led many roman catholics to point to him as the prime supporter of their views . but it was not always so . he was a critic of his brother james addison 's realism , also known as non-religious liberals , who held to what he called `` a quasi-devotional `` spiritual dimension .

he is sometimes referred to as the father of modern feminism , and is best known as the editor of feminism and modernity , and feminist religious figure kate millett , who wrote poetry from addison 's perspective . in contemporary english-language `` feminist writers `` he is sometimes called `` addison-gilmore `` , and perhaps `` gottlieb johnson `` .

== early life ==
james maitland was born on 29 march 1848 , his father was sir alexander ramsay-gibson-maitland of clifton hall , and his mother was thomasina maitland ( née hunt ) , and two brothers william and keith . sir anthony was a descendant of the earl of lauderdale ; however , it was through his father 's marriage to susan ramsay that he inherited the ramsay title and lands , as all other male descendants were deceased . sir anthony became the 3rd baronet of barnton , sauchie and bannockburn.james was educated at st andrews university before leaving to attend the royal military college at sandhurst ; however , after joining the army and becoming a captain in the highland borderers , he left after one year . he married fanny white , daughter of sir thomas woollaston white , 2nd baronet of tuxford and wallingwells in 1869 , near nottingham , and they moved to craigend in 1873 . james and fanny had two daughters .


== howietoun fishery ==
howietoun fishery was established in 1873 , maitland had previously been experimenting in another site ; however , the site was prone to flooding which meant that maitland and a team of men had to try and recapture the escaped swiss trout . howietoun was an ideal spot as it had a water supply from lake coulter and a steady supply of spring water also.maitland believed that fish could be raised in a similar way as farm animals , in that animal husbandry could also be successful when applied to a fishery . maitland 's approach to experimentation was a scientific one ; he would only change one variable during an experiment and then would hypothesise how the outcome had happened . this meant that he was able to work out that breeding young stock of fish gave a result of weak offspring ; instead , he realised older stock must be used to gain strong offspring . he worked out that the female fish must be stripped of their eggs and male milt collected in october ; he then worked on hatching boxes for the live ova . after the fry hatched , then they were transferred to rearing boxes before being transferred to plank ponds . maitland was meticulous in writing up his experiments ; this means that every change that he made in the diet , transport and selective breeding of the fish was documented . there are even pictures with measurements of the instruments maitland was inventing to make rearing fish easier.maitland also experimented on the diet of the trout and salmon at the fishery ; he worked out that horse spleen when ingested by trout caused blindness and nutritional cataracts . he worked on several options before concluding that the best option for feeding trout and salmon was horsemeat , shellfish and eggs.one of his most important experiments was finding ways to transport large quantities of live ova , at the time live ova were sent in crammed packages and when they arrived most did not survive , maitland took three attempts to work out how to insulate the cargo to stop fluctuations in temperature . successful shipments were then sent to wellington , dunedin and otago in the specially designed shipment boxes that maitland had designed himself .


=== awards ===
the work of maitland at howietoun fishery meant that he was awarded several diplomas in fish culture and two gold medals in 1883 and 1885 , at the international fisheries exhibitions , edinburgh .


== death and legacy ==
maitland died on 9 november 1897 , his daughter mary steel-maitland and her husband arthur steel-maitland took over the running of howietoun . howietoun fishery was then amalgamated into the northern fisheries company in 1914 before the maitland family sold it in 1969 . it became a part of the university of stirling aquaculture institute in 1979.the majority of brown trout re-stocking in scotland is achieved through the stock of howietoun fishery .

= howard penman =
howard latimer penman ( 1909-1984 ) was a british meteorologist . he formulated penman ’ s formula which is used worldwide by meteorologists and agricultural scientists to assess evaporation rates in different setups ( lakes and ponds , lawns , cropped fields ) and locations in the world . with john monteith he formulated the penman–monteith equation which is used to calculate evapotranspiration and the need for crop irrigation . penman was a distinguished rothamsted research scientist and government advisor , and a well-known local figure in harpenden .


== early life ==
howard penman was born in county durham and studied at durham university where he graduated in physics in 1930 . while working for the british cotton research association in manchester he worked on his thesis for his ph.d. , which was awarded by durham university in 1938 . bored by the work on cotton dyes he applied in 1937 for a post in the soil physics department at rothamsted research , headed by bernard keen , for a salary of £320 per annum . he became interested in the records of the drain gauges , and their relationship with rainfall , and from these was able to estimate the rate at which water evaporated from bare soil . from these beginnings some of his major contributions would follow . when war broke out he was recruited by the admiralty and worked on the sound output of ships and submarines in connection with the development of acoustic mines . in 1944 he was recalled to rothamsted to work on the physics of wet soil in preparation for the land campaign , where the progress of military vehicles would be vital .


== career ==
after the war he continued work on water-related topics , including irrigation needs worldwide , and seasonal water balances for each catchment area in britain . r.k. schofield succeeded bernard keen in 1947 , but in 1954 schofield became head of the chemistry department and penman was appointed head of the separate physics department . several members of his staff were involved in meteorological projects in africa , and scientists came to be trained before taking posts in nigeria , kenya and uganda and elsewhere , working on the needs of tropical crops . in 1961 he served as president of the royal meteorological society , and he was elected fellow of the royal society in 1965 . he served on many academic and government bodies , and travelled widely , advising on reservoir projects and water needs , and was awarded the o.b.e . he retired from rothamsted in 1974 , but continued to take an interest in scientific and international issues until his death in 1984 .


== writings ==
besides his work penman also used to write humorous and satirical sketches . as a person he had a keen intellect and questioning temperament , but a fine sense of humour which showed itself in many ways , such as at the christmas pantomimes at rothamsted where he wrote some of the satirical sketches .


== contribution ==
with his wife nan he was very much involved with the united nations association and the need for international cooperation to solve the long term problems of peace and development . john monteith in his royal society obituary article wrote : “ by showing how classical physics can be used to solve environmental problems , howard penman made a unique contribution to agricultural meteorology and hydrology . his finest memorial is the formula which bears his name . ”

udo perl ( 10 december 1875 , kiel – 24 september 1951 , frankfurt am main ) was a german physicist and inventor . he made important contributions in the field of electrical engineering , optics , and magnetism . his invention of the valve valve , which eliminated the need for valves and other complicated mechanical operations in electricity production , led to the industrial application of mechanical valve operating systems .


== biography ==
perl 's mother died when he was three years old , after which his father returned to germany and was sent to study at the university of kiel . he studied engineering at the newly created technische hochschule in hamburg , during which he designed an early motor vehicle , and then for the remainder of his academic career studied mechanical engineering at the university of heidelberg . he returned to kiel in 1911 to study engineering . after gaining his ph.d. in 1920 , he worked at the deutsche physikalische gesellschaft ( dpg ) in berlin , becoming a privatdozent in 1926 . there he was part of an electronic experiment-group , where he formulated the principle of the perihelion flow ( which he independently demonstrated in 1916 ) , which allowed the dynamic regulation of transformers to be used for control . from 1928 to 1932 , perl was also professor of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering at kiel .
in 1925 perl received his ph.d. from kiel , but was kept from it by prohibition legislation in germany . instead , he was placed in a theresienstadt internment camp , for eight months during which he worked on digital circuits for siemens in leipzig . in 1928 he went to work at the deutsche physikalische gesellschaft ( dpg ) in berlin as a privatdozent , and remained there until 1949 . there he was involved in research into transmission electron microscopes , infrared detection and control systems , and radar .


== work in germany ==
on 27 march 1939 , at the opening of the second world war , perl was drafted into the allied armed forces . he was interned in sachsenhausen , germany . on 8 may , the nazis arrested him and stripped him of all his possessions , including his car , and sent him to a camp in ravensbrück , where he remained for three months before being sent to the nazi concentration camp of jömno for six months . after being liberated by the soviets on 5 june 1941 , he then transferred to the rhine-eisenach military hospital where he was interned until the end of world war ii .
perl 's nuclear research career took off from there . in the late 1950s he developed an early apparatus for magnetically levitating a tablet using spark flux , using an aluminium stick to force the structure to bend , the same kind of technique that had been used in experimenting with magnetism in diamonds.later work on magnetrons started in germany , by wilhelm hsieh . perl played a key role in applying magnetrons to ferroelectric circuitry , but with a very small yield . perl proposed a method that used large , silent , and static sparks to generate complex magnetic fields , such as magnetic fields around a solid source . he demonstrated this at a theoretical level in 1958 in the paper `` a prototype magnetic superhydrophobe `` , which he presented at the european physical society meeting in leipzig . he also worked on using magnetic fields to generate light with superconductors .


== later life and legacy ==
perl died on 24 september 1951 , at the age of 75 , in frankfurt am main .

== biography ==
kulik was born in lemberg , which was part of the austrian empire , and is now lviv located in ukraine .


== kulik 's factor tables ==
in 1825 , kulik mentioned a table of factors up to 30 million , but this table does no longer seem to exist . it is also not clear if it had really been completed .
from about 1825 until 1863 kulik produced a factor table of numbers up to 100330200 ( except for numbers divisible by 2 , 3 , or 5 ) . this table basically had the same format than the table to 30 million and it is therefore most likely that the work on the `` magnus canon divisorum `` spanned from the mid-1820s to kulik 's death , at which time the tables were still unfinished . these tables fill eight volumes totaling 4212 pages , and are kept in the archives of the academy of sciences in vienna . volume ii of the 8-volume set has been lost .

william morris leiserson ( 1883–1957 ) was a notable labor relations scholar and mediator .
leiserson , perhaps the twentieth century 's most influential labor mediator during the rise of labor unions and collective bargaining in the united states , was a professor , state and federal government administrator , mediator , arbitrator , and a member of president franklin d. roosevelt ’ s `` brain trust `` which developed and wrote legislation such as the railway labor act of 1934 .


== biography ==
born in 1883 , in reval , tsarist russia ( in an area later to become the nation of estonia ) , william morris leiserson came to the united states at the age of seven with his mother and two brothers . as a student at the university of wisconsin , he studied under professor john r. commons , whose life and work inspired leiserson to pursue the fields of economics and labor relations . after graduation , he continued at columbia university where he earned his ph.d. under henry rogers seager in 1911 .
leiserson then began a distinguished career as a research scholar , professor and public administrator that was marked by four decades of high level service in an era of profound economic , political and cultural change . shortly after receiving his ph.d. he returned to wisconsin where he originated the state employment service . returning to academia , he held professorships at the university of toledo and antioch college . his u.s. government service included chief of the labor administration division of the united states department of labor , secretary of the national labor board of the national recovery administration ( nra ) and member of the national labor relations board ( nlrb ) . the nlrb was the administrative arm of the wagner act , seminal legislation that guaranteed the right of workers to bargain collectively .
leiserson 's favorite government position was chairman of the national mediation board . this organization became the u.s. government 's administrative arm for implementing the railway labor act , which leiserson was instrumental in writing for the u.s. congress . the act later was amended to include the airline industry . this , also seminal , legislation provided thorough , and effective procedures ( carefully not requiring lawyers ) for solving labor-management disputes among transportation workers and industries providing essential services to the u.s. economy . to this day the legislation provides a prototype for resolving disputes that involve essential services .
most of the foregoing positions were appointments by president franklin d. roosevelt , during the great depression of the 1930s and world war ii . after leaving government service , he retired and returned to research and teaching at johns hopkins university . leiserson died in 1957 at the age of 74.while he devoted much scholarly and research effort to increasing the government 's awareness of the status and needs of the wage earner , leiserson understood well the role of the mediator and the art of balancing the interests of labor and management in industrial disputes . leiserson was awarded the honorary degree of doctor of laws by oberlin college , june 24 , 1947 .

= samuel kinsey =
samuel kinsey ( 25 may 1832 – 8 june 1883 ) was a christian minister and leader of the reactionary wing of the german baptist brethren that became the old german baptist brethren .


== early life ==
samuel kinsey was born in covington , ohio on 25 may 1832 to joel kinsey and elizabeth brumbaugh . on 23 april 1852 , he married barbara nead , daughter of peter nead , and together they had thirteen children . he joined the brethren as a member in 1853 . kinsey was economically successful , and was at various times a carpenter , a farmer , proprietor of a general store , owner of a tree nursery , and publisher . the place where he lived became known as the town of kinsey station . he was a deacon and was elected in 1870 as a recognized minister of lower stillwater brethren congregation in randolph township near dayton , ohio .


== old order leadership ==
between 1851 and 1865 , brethren periodicals began to be published under progressive editors henry kurtz , james quinter , and henry holsinger . at the same time , kinsey 's father-in-law , peter nead , was the primary leader for the reactionary wing of the brethren , known as old order brethren . out of this group emerged a new periodical , the vindicator , with kinsey as editor . it was first published on 1 march 1870 as an eight-page monthly , composed of scriptural interpretations , exhortations to piety , and news on church affairs . one of its goals was to counter the influence of progressive brethren periodicals.a major controversy among the brethren arose over the authority of tradition and the role of the church in establishing a church order or ordnung , known as the `` order of the brethren `` . in the vindicator , kinsey rejected that the church had any authority to change or adapt the order . this view sharply contrasted with other brethren at the time . the group that became the church of the brethren revered tradition and supported the role of the church in discerning an ordnung , but held this order to be changeable . meanwhile , the faction that became the brethren church rejected the need for a unified church order or agreement on practices not explicitly defined in christian scripture and sought to eliminate some brethren traditions which they felt lacked support from the scriptures.in around 1874 , kinsey handed over control of his business interests to others in order to devote himself to the service of the church . he was a hymn writer . in 1878 , kinsey was one of four men appointed and financially supported by the southern ohio district of the brethren to engage in missionary work in kentucky . this work was largely unsuccessful.a significant part of kinsey 's ministry was also his ongoing publishing . the vindicator was expanded to 32 pages per issue . his work was not well received ; kinsey was reprimanded by the 1881 brethren annual conference for encouraging dissension and criticizing church authorities . the old german baptist brethren split at this conference , with nead and kinsey as their primary leaders . the proliferation of unauthorized and uncontrolled periodicals has been claimed as a major cause of the division . in 1882 , at their first meeting , the old german baptist brethren recognized the vindicator as their official publication . kinsey was also ordained as an elder in 1882 .


== death and legacy ==
kinsey died on 8 june 1883 . he was succeeded as editor by joseph i . cover . the vindicator set a precedent of conservative periodicals that was followed by mennonite george r. brunk 's sword and trumpet . kinsey has continued to be influential in the old german baptist brethren . the vindicator continues to be published for the old german baptist brethren as of 2008 .

== football ==

koch was a pioneer in introducing ball games as part of physical education in german schools . he was influenced by the ideas of thomas arnold respectively thomas hughes ' novel tom brown 's school days . in 1874 koch and his colleague august hermann organized what is believed to be the first-ever football match in germany , between pupils from their school martino-katharineum . however , according to other sources , earlier games of football might have taken place in other german cities , possibly between members of the dresden english football club.in 1875 , koch published the first german version of the rules of football , although koch 's version of the game still closely resembled rugby football . the new game was quickly adopted by other schools in braunschweig and spread to other cities during the late 1870s , including hanover , bremen , hamburg , and göttingen.in 1876 , a newspaper in hamburg wrote that koch had learned about football during a trip to england . this is likely false , as there are no sources that indicate that he had visited england before 1895 . koch did speak english , however , as he had been taught from a young age by his father , an english teacher .

= franz hauser =
franz xaver hauser ( 12 january 1794 in krasowitz , today krasovice , part of kondrac , ( benešov district ) , czech republic – 14 august 1870 in freiburg im breisgau ) was a singer , voice teacher , and music manuscript collector .
at his father 's insistence , he first studied medicine , but he then studied singing with johann wenzel tomaschek and composition with oboist josef triebensee .
he made his stage debut in 1817 in prague as sarastro in mozart 's magic flute . he found great success at the opera theaters in vienna , leipzig , and berlin . he retired from the stage in 1838 and taught singing in vienna . in 1846 he was appointed as director of the newly established conservatory in munich ( now the hochschule für musik und theater münchen ) , serving as its director until 1864 . he retired in 1865 to karlsruhe and two years later to freiburg im breisgau .
contemporary critics considered hauser cold as an actor but approved of his pure voice . he was known for his interpretation of weber and as figaro ( both rossini 's and mozart 's ) , bertram , william tell , and spohr 's faust .
hauser had many students including jenny lind and henriette sontag . he wrote a popular singing manual , gesanglehre für lehrer und lernende ( leipzig , 1866 ) ( freely available through google books ) . as a composer , he was known for his songs . his correspondence with composer moritz hauptmann was published in two volumes in 1871 .
hauser 's greatest significance today is as a collector of musical manuscripts –most notably of the composer johann sebastian bach- assembling the greatest 19th century collection of that composer 's manuscripts . he was a consultant for the bach-gesellschaft edition and prepared a thematic catalogue of bach 's works . most of hauser 's bach manuscripts ( including 19 cantatas , the accompanied sonatas for violin , and the english suites for keyboard ) were acquired by the berlin royal library in 1904 . others were destroyed in 1945 . parts of his collection are also in the darmstadt landesbibliothek and the harvard university loeb music library .
his son , moritz hauser ( 1827–1857 ) , became a theater director in königsberg and a minor composer .

== life ==

reinhold mannheim was born in berlin in 1892 . he began his early ornithological studies in gießen , where his father owned a shop . after graduating in 1900 he worked in a leather factory . after leaving the factory in 1904 , he did his zoological research , briefly doing field work in germany . in 1906 he moved to heidelberg as an assistant to the zoologist and collector carl schultze . this position allowed him to tour europe , south america , australia and new zealand .
in 1919 he was appointed head of the ornithological section at the landsdämmerungs-gesellschaft ( landmarks scientific office ) , a post he held for 20 years . during this period , he also made numerous scientific discoveries , and started the bird collection in heidelberg . in 1921 he collected more than 400 new birds and collected close to 1,000 g. mannheim believed that ornithological knowledge could be promoted through service , with the collector being held in high regard . however , because there were very few male collectors in the united states , the former mayor of heidelberg , adolf wilke , called mannheim 's efforts `` a real mother 's milk `` .after four years , the work was abandoned because there was not enough of a demand for ornithological specimens . he retired from this job in 1925 and he became a teacher , self-employed and at the same time a keen amateur ornithologist . he died in heidelberg .

giovanni battista ( or giambattista ) brocchi ( 18 february 1772 – 25 september 1826 ) was an italian naturalist , mineralogist and geologist .


== biography ==
he was born in bassano del grappa , italy , and studied jurisprudence at the university of padova , but his attention was turned to mineralogy and botany . in 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in the new lyceum of brescia ; but he more especially devoted himself to geological researches in the adjacent districts . the fruits of these labors appeared in different publications , particularly in his trattato mineralogico e chimico sulle miniere di ferro del dipartimento del mella ( 1808 ) a treatise on the iron mines of the mella traditional region . these researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in the recently established kingdom of italy , and enabled him to extend his investigations over a great part of the country.in 1811 brocchi produced a valuable essay entitled memoria mineralogica sulla valle di fassa in tirolo ; but his most important work is the conchiologia fossile subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli apennini , e sul suolo adiacente ( 2 vols . , milan , 1814 ) , containing accurate details of the structure of the apennine range , and an account of the fossils of the italian tertiary strata compared with existing species . these subjects were further illustrated by his geognostic map , and his catalogo ragionato di una raccolta di rocce , disposto con ordine geografico , per servire alla geognosia dell ' italia ( milan , 1817 ) . his work dello stato fisico del suolo di rome ( 1820 ) , with its accompanying map , is likewise noteworthy . in it he corrected the erroneous views of scipione breislak , who conceived that rome occupies the site of a volcano , to which he ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills . brocchi pointed out that these materials were derived either from monte albano , an extinct volcano , twelve miles from the city , or from the monti cimini , still farther to the
north.in 1814 brocchi presented the thesis that species , like individuals , age and eventually die out , - an idea that later influenced charles darwin.several papers by him , on mineralogical subjects , appeared in the biblioteca italiana from 1816 to 1823 . in the latter year , brocchi sailed for egypt , in order to explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources . every facility was granted by mehemet ali , who in 1825 appointed him one of a commission to examine the territory of the recently conquered kingdom of sennar ; but brocchi , unfortunately for science , fell a victim to the climate , and died at khartoum.much of his writings and collections are now housed in the museo civico di bassano .

`` `` in an interesting display of his scientific creativity , dr. makarovich also showed off the extreme individualism and freedom he enjoyed in his life .... just when we thought he could remain a morose scientist in the milieu of rampant totalitarianism and the great purge , he turned from statistics and time constraints to large scale speculation on a broad variety of topics . these included the hitherto unreported development of the pumlin-like organism from the balakiella on lake baikal and its possible links with the molluscs and gastropods that inhabited the deposits . the books of the ukrainian scientists that had disappeared in 1942 became the subject of very early 'new research on the geological histories of the tatar republics . this was accompanied by a move from primitive mud crabs to hitherto undiscovered species of fish , e.g . the bafalikid amphibians . moreover the development of the scientific and technological world of air conditioning changed the lives of many in the soviet union. ``

arthur c. miller ( september 6 , 1911 – november 15 , 1984 ) was a canadian physicist who was widely considered a pioneer of the study of condensed matter physics . miller is best known for his discovery of a basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium , which he named in his honor , although miller was also a notable theoretical physicist .


== biography ==
born in hamilton , ontario , miller attended the university of toronto with lloyd boron , and later earned a b.a . degree in physics with a minor in mathematics from the university of toronto in 1941 .
in 1942 , miller received a f.r.s . degree in physics from the university of british columbia , as well as a fellowship of the toronto academy . in 1953 , he was awarded an m.s . degree from the university of minnesota , and in 1955 received a ph.d. from the university of toronto . in 1958 , he returned to the university of toronto , where he was a member of the b.s . department , a laboratory assistant , and an instructor in physics . from 1959 to 1965 , miller was a professor of physics , co-chair of the physics department , and an assistant to the chancellor , harold m. schonberg , whose efforts resulted in the establishment of the department of physics . miller returned to his position at the university of toronto in 1971 as professor of physics , as the department grew . he was also on the editorial boards of physics today , the proceedings of the royal society of canada , and the canadian journal of physics . in 1973 , he was elected to the royal society of canada .
in the late 1960s and early 1970s , he investigated the properties of hydromelites and gaseous ices by experiments in liquid helium . miller published many papers on theoretical physics and topics in condensed matter physics , including the theory of the condensation of liquid helium , the infrared spectroscopy of helium , the crystallographic properties of plasmas , and the theory of shock-absorption at atomic resolution .


== work ==
in 1943 , miller obtained his first research results on compressible gases by studying the interactions of droplets of helium between two metals , among them chloride and zinc . at that time , the ices of water were highly compressible , although in 1912 miller discovered a superfluidity limit of about one . miller 's work on this limit and other phenomena became known as miller 's law . miller named his discovery of the limit as a collaboration with hans bethe , who became miller 's colleague at the university . in 1946 , he became assistant professor of the department of physics at the university of toronto , but went on to become professor emeritus in 1976 . miller authored an elementary textbook on condensed matter physics .


== other notable accomplishments ==
miller is perhaps best known for his 1943 discovery of the basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium . that law states that a liquid will not condense as it becomes denser and colder , a characteristic known as the miller 's law of elasticity . miller obtained this result by observing the interaction of the air and the liquid helium . he came to believe that this boundary must be large enough for the maximum dissipation of heat , which he called the miller 's law . in that 1970s paper , he considered an `` experimental remedy `` for the thermal convection and conduction of liquid helium : compressible metals will compress as they get colder , thus stopping the flow of convection . to obtain this result , miller used x-ray diffraction to isolate the metal-helium boundary in helium .


== nationality ==
he is canadian of dutch , english , welsh , scottish , and gaelic ancestry .

== early life and career ==
gaffky 's parents were the shipping agent georg friedrich wilhelm gaffky , and emma schumacher . his medical studies at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin were completed in 1873 after an interruption by the franco-prussian war in 1870 . his dissertation postulated a relationship between lead poisoning and kidney disease . he worked as an assistant at the berlin charité hospital and passed the state medical exams in 1875 . he then worked as an army surgeon .
gaffky worked as an assistant to robert koch in berlin . under koch 's leadership , gaffky and others developed bacteriological protocols and achieved progress in identifying causes of infectious diseases .


== principal discoveries ==
following karl joseph eberth 's description of a bacillus suspected as the cause of typhus , and koch 's independent work on the same organism , gaffky dedicated years to improving culture methods to isolate the bacillus . he was able to produce cultures in gelatin and other hosts .
in 1884 , gaffky published results reporting that he had isolated the eberthella or gaffky-eberth bacillus in 26 of 28 cases of typhoid.gaffky was later part of an expedition to egypt in which koch identified transmission methods of cholera . he became a government advisor during the 1892 cholera outbreak in hamburg . he led an investigation of the 1897 outbreak of bubonic plague in india .
gaffky served as director of the berlin institute for infectious diseases from 1904–1913 .

= sverre petterssen =
sverre petterssen ( 19 february 1898 – 31 december 1974 ) was a norwegian meteorologist , prominent in the field of weather analysis and forecasting .


== early life ==
born in norway into a humble family , he paid for his higher education by working at the telegraph office , and a nursery provided by the armed forces that he joined as a recruit . he studied in bergen where he met tor bergeron during a lecture , and was so impressed by his analysis of a 1922 storm that he joined the bergen school of meteorology in 1923 .
in the late 1920s he worked at the geophysical institute in tromsø , northern norway .


== career ==
after school , he remained a weather officer in the norwegian air force until 1939 . he went to the us in 1935 , lecturing on norwegian meteorological theories to the us navy and caltech . in 1939 , he was hired by mit as head of the meteorology department , and wrote two important books there : weather analysis and forecasting ( 1940 ) and introduction to meteorology ( 1941 ) .
with the invasion of norway , petterssen returned to europe and offered his services in england to the met office , on loan from the norwegian air force . during world war ii , he served as a weather forecaster for bombing raids and special operations .
he is most remembered for his work in what has been called the most significant weather forecast in history , the d-day forecast , where he contributed significantly to the postponement of d-day by one day . three groups of meteorologists gave advice to general dwight eisenhower , and d-day was originally planned for 5 june 1944 . but he got big trouble with academically untrained competitors , especially from the united states , who believed that the weather was repeated – and had found a weather recurring pattern in the 20s that they felt was positive . and general dwight d. eisenhower was relying on his men .
`` pettersen , which was not always as diplomatic , made it clear that this was nonsense and quasi science but eisenhower was convinced , and the invasion would take place on 5 june . but at the morning meeting on 4 june pettersen presented a weather map showing a storm on 5 june . to strong protests from the american quasi-meteorologist , d-day was postponed.the german war fleet was laid in port : they thought it could not get any invasion because of the storm .
but the norwegian meteorologist knew his meteorology : his analysis showed a 36-hour gap between two storms the morning of 6 june – just enough to make the giant attack with more than 100,000 soldiers , planes , paratroopers and boats . `` the forecast provided by sverre petterssen caused eisenhower to decide at 0430 on 4 june to postpone d-day to 6 june . initially it was proposed to postpone the operation to 19 june .

on 19 june the worst storm to date in the century struck the english channel . if d-day had been launched on 5 june as originally planned , the allied casualties would probably have been much higher , and even higher if launched on 19 june .


== aftermath ==
in retrospect , americans claimed – including in movies – it was their meteorologists heroes who saved the situation , and only in 1974 , shortly before his death , sverre pettersen came with his version – documenting a violent quarrel .
the american meteorological historian james fleming also honored pettersen in a report 30 years later – in 2004 .

== life ==
broucke was born on a farm in furnes , belgium . he studied at the catholic university of leuven , earning bachelor 's and master 's degrees in mathematics in 1955 and 1957 respectively , under the mentorship of georges lemaître . after completing his military service he worked for the oil industry while earning a second master 's degree , in operations research , from the university of brussels in 1960.he returned to leuven for his doctoral work , on the three-body problem , which he completed in 1962 . at this time he moved to california to work at the jet propulsion laboratory ; while there , he also took adjunct positions at west coast university , the university of southern california , and the university of california , los angeles ( ucla ) . his position at ucla became a regular-rank associate professorship in 1969.in 1975 , broucke moved to the university of texas at austin as an associate professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics . at austin , he helped found the texas institute for computational mechanics in 1976 .


== contributions ==
in the three-body problem , broucke 's doctoral research involved pioneering use of computer simulations to classify stable and unstable orbits . he investigated what happens to this classification for earth–moon–satellite systems in the limit as the ratio of earth to moon mass approaches zero ; his conjecture about this limiting behavior , `` broucke 's principle `` , was finally proven correct in 1981 by lawrence perko . as part of this work , he also developed symbolic computation methods for handling poisson series.later , he studied the anisotropic kepler problem , a mathematical model of the motion of an electron trapped in a potential well . as he showed , this system is not purely chaotic : it has periodic orbits as well . he also studied the use of gravity assist in finding efficient flight plans for space probes .

charles latif hyder ( april 18 , 1930 – june 8 , 2004 ) , known in the ussr as `` dr haider , `` was an american astrophysicist and dissident from albuquerque , new mexico .


== biography ==
hyder was born in albuquerque , new mexico in 1930 . after graduating from albuquerque high school , he served in the united states air force during the korean war.hyder attended the university of new mexico , graduating with bachelor 's ( 1958 ) and master 's ( 1960 ) degrees in physics . in 1964 , he received a doctorate in astrophysics from the university of colorado . through the 1970s and 1980s , he was involved in various scientific activities in the field of solar physics , publishing more than 50 works , and was also involved in nasa 's solar maximum mission satellite .
hyder was married twice and had four children .


== activism ==
hyder was most noted for his strong anti-nuclear stance , as well as for hunger strikes which he used to advocate his causes . he began a supposed 218-day hunger strike on september 23 , 1986 near the white house in washington , demanding that ronald reagan stop the arms race and eliminate the use of nuclear weapons.in the soviet union , hyder was a regular participant on the broadcast program vremya ( 'time ' ) . a commemorative medal was minted in his honor . mikhail gorbachev wrote a letter to him , and when the hunger strike ended , soviet punk rock band nol ( 'zero ' ) composed a satirical song entitled `` доктор хайдер `` ( `` dr. haider `` ) , with its refrain meaning `` dr. haider has started to eat again ! ``


== controversy ==
in the usa , hyder 's hunger strike did not attract much attention . furthermore , the astrophysicist was not always present at the white house . the russian gosteleradio ( government broadcasting ) correspondent in washington , vladimir dunaev , introduced and explained the scientist 's story to the russian audience . dunaev 's son later revealed that to make the hunger strike look continuous , dunaev would shoot five stories in succession every day , asking dr. hyder to change into different suits and ties .
according to dunaev , hyder was advised by doctors to diet , as his weight openly threatened his health . during the hunger strike he lost almost half of his weight of 300 pounds . it was later revealed that hyder drank fruit juice and took vitamins during the hunger strike . according to the most skeptical physicians , he fasted only in the daytime .
after the end of the hunger strike , hyder ran for president . he also subsequently accused the ussr of environmental pollution , after which russian news agencies stopped reporting about him in the ussr . in 1999 , he published the book `` human survival on a plutonium-contaminated planet , `` again trying to fast in order to fight against the storage of nuclear waste ( waste isolation pilot plant ) .

william henry dallinger frs ( 5 july 1839 – 7 november 1909 ) was a british minister in the wesleyan methodist church . he was also an accomplished scientist , being the first to study the complete lifecycle of unicellular organisms under the microscope and studying the adaptation of such organisms to temperature.he made numerous contributions to microscopy , and was president of the quekett microscopical club from 1889 to 1892 . dallinger was awarded three honorary doctorates , the ll.d . from victoria college , toronto in 1884 , the d.sc . from dublin in 1892 , and the d.l.c . from durham in 1896 .
dallinger was married to emma ion goldsmith ( 1842-1910 ) . they had one child , son percy gough ( 1867-1930 ) .


== research into darwin 's theories ==
dallinger was one of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment . in the late 19th century , he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years ( 1880–1886 ) . dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °f up to 158 °f . the early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °f , and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °f . the organisms dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment , on the other hand , were perfectly fine at 158 °f . however , these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °f . dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for darwinian adaptation in his incubator , and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment . unfortunately , dallinger 's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886 , and dallinger could not continue this line of research .
dallinger was an early supporter of darwinism . he accepted natural selection and considered creationism to be `` absolutely untenable `` . he believed there was no conflict between religion and science and there was no reason to try and reconcile the book of genesis with geology .

randall-maciver was educated at the queens college , oxford . he graduated in 1896 with a first class degree . he began his professional archaeological career in 1898 working for flinders petrie in egypt , uncovering the mortuary temple of senwosret iii at abydos . in 1906 he was appointed as curator of the egyptian section at the penn museum , university of pennsylvania , taking charge of the collection following sara yorke stevenson 's resignation in 1905.with funding from eckley b. coxe jr. , randall-maciver initiated research into the relationship between egypt and nubia , uncovering some of the earliest evidence of ancient nubian culture , dating back to 3100bce . between 1905 and 1906 randall-maciver conducted the first detailed study of great zimbabwe . the absence of any artefacts of non-african origin led him to conclude that the structure was built by local people . earlier scholars had speculated that the structure had been built by arab or phoenician traders . between 1907 and 1910 he excavated the site of karanog , a former provincial capital of the kingdom of kush .
randall-maciver left penn museum in 1911 following a disagreement with new museum director george byron gordon , becoming librarian of the american geographical society . in 1914 he left the ags to work as a british intelligence officer in the first world war . in 1921 he moved to italy to study etruscan archaeology . he remained in italy during world war ii , assisting the allied forces monuments , fine arts , and archives program , the famous `` monuments men `` , to preserve historical monuments and cultural property.randall-maciver died in new york city on 30 april 1945 .

= galileo ferraris =
galileo ferraris ( 31 october 1847 – 7 february 1897 ) was an italian physicist and electrical engineer , one of the pioneers of ac power system and an inventor of the three-phase induction motor . many newspapers touted that his work on the induction motor and power transmission systems were some of the greatest inventions of all ages . he published an extensive and complete monograph on the experimental results obtained with open-circuit transformers of the type designed by the power engineers lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs .


== biography ==
born at livorno vercellese ( kingdom of sardinia ) , ferraris gained a master 's degree in engineering and became an assistant of technical physics near the regal italian industrial museum . ferraris independently researched the rotary magnetic field in 1885 . ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors . the research and his studies resulted in the development of an alternator , which may be thought of as an alternating-current motor operating in reverse , so as to convert mechanical ( rotating ) power into electric power ( as alternating current ) .
on 11 march 1888 , ferraris published his research in a paper to the royal academy of sciences in turin ( two months later nikola tesla gained u.s. patent 381,968 , application filed october 12 , 1887 . serial number 252,132 ) . these alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts , and depended on rotating magnetic field for their operation . the resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance . the invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification , as is the power transformer . these inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances . polyphase power enabled the use of water-power ( via hydroelectric generating plants in large dams ) in remote places , thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity , which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done . this versatility sparked the growth of power-transmission network grids on continents around the globe .
in 1889 , ferraris worked at the italian industrial institution , a school of electrical engineering ( the first school of this kind in italy , subsequently incorporated in the politecnico di torino ) . in 1896 , ferraris joined the italian electrotechnical association and became the first national president of the organization .
galileo ferraris did not confine his research interests to electricity . he also researched the fundamental properties of dioptric instruments and made elementary representation of the theory and its applications . his work contains a detailed description of the geometric dioptrics for uncentered systems . he provided a greater generality as previously found in the telescopic system treatments , with less emphasis on applications .
in the second main sections , the results obtained are applied to optical instruments . the magnification , field of view , and the brightness of the instrument were dealt with in great detail . the field denned as the author of the cone opening angle , the tip of the first main points of the lens , and its base formed by the parts of the object in view , will possess the same brightness . the eye is not treated .


== memorials ==
the city of turin honored the contributions that ferraris made to science . a general committee proposed an addition to the royal industrial museum of turin with a permanent monument commemorating his scientific and industrial achievements . additionally , an avenue was named in honor of ferraris .

= leonard dubkin =
leonard dubkin ( 1905-1972 ) was an american author and naturalist from chicago .
he is known for his books and newspaper columns on the subject of wildlife found in urban locations .


== early life ==
leonard dubkin was born in 1905 in odessa , ukraine ( then russia . ) he came to the united states with his parents in 1907 . the oldest of seven with a chronically ill father , his family relied on jewish charity organizations . in the eighth grade , leonard dropped out of school to work and take care of his family . by the age of 12 he was taking meticulous notes on the life histories of butterflies and moths . he took an interest in nature from an early age and frequently contributed to the children 's pages of the chicago tribune . the social worker jane addams took an interest in him and gave him his first typewriter . this paved his way to a career in journalism.in 1934 he married actress muriel schwartz and created a local talent directory for radio and stage actors . this successful business allowed him to write his novels , review books for the new york times , and correspond with other nature writers such as rachel carson and edwin way teale .
often featured in his books and columns is his daughter pauline yearwood , herself a successful journalist and the managing editor for the chicago jewish news .


== career ==
dubkin had difficulty committing to the topics assigned by editors in favor of observing nature . en route to cover a plane crash at midway airport , he stopped to observe a cricket singing in a field . by the time he got to the scene of the accident , all the survivors had been taken away . he missed another story by exploring a church tower where pigeons went to nest or die . on a pivotal case in which he was sent to interview a murder suspect , he became distracted by squirrels nesting in the walls of the suspect 's home . upon returning to the office without a scoop , he was fired .
in the following period of unemployment and occasional dispiriting office jobs , he took to observing nature closely instead of looking for work . among the creatures he observed in chicago were ballooning spiders , bats , crickets , polyphemus moths and cecropia moths.he eventually found work as an amateur naturalist , writing about his subject in a newspaper column with lerner newspapers and in his own books .
he authored six books , now out of print , about the natural history of chicago , arguing for the preservation of secret places , small parks , and urban wildlife . he wrote a column called `` the birds and bees `` in the lerner newspapers , published between 1950 and 1972 . during this time there was little to no nature writing taking place in chicago - conservation efforts focused on larger suburban spaces , such as forest preserves .
he became a champion of everyday wildlife and promoted the idea that wildlife worth observing was not necessarily exotic.a city park in chicago is named for him , dubkin park , where he often ate lunch while working for the lerner newspapers . the park has a community garden , many species of native and non-native plants , and a blank wall along the metra tracks . before she died in 2016 , his daughter planted a peony in his memory at the park . it is still there .

between 1973 and 1978 , bernal was a senior fellow in canada at the laval university , specializing in the human brain . in his personal literature , bernal quotes henry hill ( who would later become a professor of psychology at the university of toronto ) . hill later wrote that bernal , `` the overwhelming leader of neuroscience , deserves credit for turning the “ arms of psychology to a serious problem in latin america ” `` .
bernal is best known for his research on hallucinatory phenomena in visual cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders . his work with h.m. senn ( associate professor of psychology at dalhousie university ) is especially cited in a 2008 book titled “ the brain and the soul : personalized neurology for neuroscientists and patients ” . it consists of numerous presentations of neurophysiological images and experiments that demonstrate a brain involvement in pathological conditions . in his writings and interviews , he acknowledges that `` misdiagnoses may be more prevalent than the general population realizes , `` and that these abnormalities are `` actually relatively rare , and in the context of normal cognitive processes will probably not cause functional problems. ``


== early life and education ==
he was born in muñoz , spain , the son of carlos and bessida bernal . he received his undergraduate degree at laval university and phd at the university of cambridge , where he met his wife ann a . ( amanda ) lindholm . together they had two daughters , ann yochi ( 1988 ) and olivia christina ( 1996 ) .
he first met and befriended l. j. bernal , a graduate student at the university of toronto ( in the 1940s ) who was deeply fascinated by neuroscience at the time , but subsequently left canada after seeing yochi and olivia in medical school . bernal helped them gain their master 's and doctoral degrees .


== career ==
in 1952 , bernal moved to canada , first to guelph and then to the university of toronto . he and linda lortieri ( of la trobe university ) established the center for neuropsychology at the university of toronto . he was asked by university of toronto president dick mellencamp to design the undergraduate program , and this started a long collaboration with other graduate students and faculty .
he was the author of 13 books ( along with lortieri ) on neuroscience and had a lengthy correspondence with anthropologist frances woolf . he also edited and collaborated with yochi . he studied neurological disorders in infants with louise bird at the university of toronto medical college.the definitive biography of l. j. bernal , the quantum brain , was published by gallica press in 1983 . he died of an overdose of opiates in september 2006 in san luis obispo , california . his daughter ( olivia christina bernal ) and granddaughter ( lauren p. bernal ) are canadian . his only daughter , anna ( ruth paul ) also worked as an ethnographer .

churinsky and other logicians called for the admission of types of rational numbers into analytic mathematics . specifically , they regarded them to have generalizations in the following way : the higher rational numbers have in general a unit of place in space . the units of place of these rational numbers , now called quotients , can thus be analyzed with the method of differential equations of general linear variables . in that way , they had proved the universal extension of the equation of linear variables in general.by making an application of the theorem `` if a normal polynomial has two rational numbers { 2 , 1 , ... , ... } , then there is a unit of place in space containing a polynomial whose units of place are both 2 and 1 `` , churinsky formulated the singular integral method of a rational number .

= thomas garrett =
thomas garrett frse fls ( 30 april 1812 – 22 february 1880 ) was a british geologist and petrologist . he wrote many scientific papers on alpine ores and minerals , and wrote for a period of time as a mineralogist . he spent much of his life at the great seat , edinburgh , becoming one of the most important exponents of the fossil record .


== early life and education ==
garrett was born on 30 april 1812 in islington , london . he was educated at hulme grammar school , and haverford college , oxford , where he achieved an a-grade in his final examination in natural philosophy . he began studying geology at the university of edinburgh , gaining a b.a . in 1838 , followed by a b.d . in 1841 .


== career ==
he was a professor of geology at the royal college of surgeons of england from 1847 to 1849 , and was a member of the geological and mining society of london for five years ( 1848–60 ) . he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1852 , and wrote 1853 and 1854 monographs on the subject of geology . he was the first geologist to suggest that continental drift had led to the appearance of fossils in north america , which suggested the presence of multi-plate magmas . he did a preliminary analysis of evidence for the holocene , and later published his conclusions in the 1854 book fossil lands , and some of the in-depth conclusions of fossil geology in the philosophical magazine , discussing the impact of a wetter climate on fossils . in 1856 , he revised and updated the classic geology textbook by thomas f. jessop , and also helped to refine the detailed geological descriptions of caves , huts and war graves in the spitsbergen and ardennes regions .
he lectured widely in europe and north america on his discoveries , especially the alcyone goldfields , and also gave talks on the history of the carboniferous mountains in europe . in 1857 , he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh , receiving his doctorate in the same year . he returned to england to take up the chair of geology at the university of edinburgh , succeeding sir thomas busby , in 1867 , having been made frs in 1845 , and became professor of geology in 1870 , and curator of the geological museum and geological collection in 1875 .
the geological survey of scotland , which he had founded in 1846 , became one of the major interests of the south-east scottish association , led by alexander campbell , in the mid-1850s . in the later part of the nineteenth century , he devoted himself to the study of gold and silver in scotland , particularly the canary islands and the islands of antigua , french guiana , curaçao , guyana , the maldives and the andaman islands .
he died on 22 february 1880 , at his house in the villambourg estate in queen 's lynn , gloucestershire .


== legacy ==
during garrett 's lifetime and especially after his death , many theories about the history of the world were popularly put forward , but a comprehensive list is omitted from the authors'obituary . these include :

the age of the earth was estimated to be over 300 million years .
there are solid sources of trace fossils , and geological times are not normally thought to be much greater than the age of the earth .
the fossil record of the earth is found in many regions throughout the world , yet in many places it is incomplete or unreliable .
the world today is overpopulated with minerals , and yet there is a lack of suitable sites for these minerals .
the fossils are in africa , southeast asia , asia minor , america , canada and australia , and the palearctic.garrett , like many leading british geologists and mineralogists of his generation , believed the gold of the australian and african coastlines may be trace fossils .

andré garrigue ( 18 december 1848 in nice – 16 january 1923 in nice ) was a french composer , conductor and music educator . he is remembered for his compositions as orpheus , goetia and hyperion .


== biography ==
garrigue was born in nice and studied at the paris conservatoire under rené lalande . at the age of 22 , he became an assistant to rené lalande . he was promoted to permanent professor in 1864 at the age of 27 . in the beginning of the 1870s , his name became associated with the gregorian chant style . garrigue published his first opera orpheus ( 1872 ) and his second ballet hyperion ( 1873 ) . together with jean lille , garrigue was the first to write the incidental music for ballet pyromante . his most significant work is the choral work orpheus ( `` the nightingale `` ) , and his other choral works include the cantatas glyphis and ionichae . among his major works are cantatas les gards de lyre , guarner ( `` lords of the light `` ) , and les destinees ( `` the dome `` ) . he died at the age of seventy-two . his cantatas , les dernières colors pour sainte marion , aristides et ida , ou elegies du carnaval , were particularly important in the introduction of the french opera genre to germany and italy .


== works ==
he composed many sacred works , which include orations for mass and for church . he also composed shorter songs for church and children 's choir . his cantatas are based on the legend of orpheus . the cantatas were generally written in a style of full length improvisation . they include scherzo cantatas , two dramatic cantatas and a overture . all of the musical works are variations of lacertes'mestre mure , or the sea song orpheus . the overture `` hyperion `` is perhaps the most famous of his overtures , being often sung at the end of st mark 's day parades , but the overture contains several elements which have become familiar : a mixture of folk and christian elements , later transformed by an overture written in 1967 by another composer , beethoven .

== career ==
in his early career , k.m . merety studied the radio waves produced by the cern-scale accelerator , radioactivity in the hydrogen dome ( the first time a working interferometer was used on such a large scale ) . during the summer vacations of 1908 , he made arrangements to use a portable zeppelin to carry out research near naples . he also returned to work as a spectrometer , experimenter , and radio relay operator , and with the university of naples in 1910 . with his father-in-law , he studied spectroscopy with friedrich nernst , with the assistance of e. newton , and physics with c. t. mehlbeck and a. kastner . in 1911 he became an associate professor , and in 1913 an assistant professor of physics and an assistant professor of theoretical physics . from 1918 to 1930 he was an assistant professor , and in 1933 became full professor . he held these positions until 1944 . he co-founded the ritter institut für naturwissenschaften und physik , and served on its editorial board until 1947 . from 1939 to 1946 , he was the director of the research institute of nuclear research .
in 1929 he demonstrated that a nucleon in a strongly ionized vacuum exists as a positron , the proton , which he identified as two protons linked by an elementary transition in his model . this was a paradigm of his later work on charged particles and the high-energy x-rays . in 1940 , he demonstrated the existence of an electron gap between two positively charged electron-positron pairs . in 1949 he carried out an experiment to determine the mass of the electron-positron pair corresponding to the proton-electron transition , which he called the positron-electron transition . by combining the features of both approaches , he developed a method for studying the mass of positron-electron pairs , which became known as the merety-einstein transition ratio . in 1954 he discovered an electron gap between an electron and a muon , known as the merety-dworkin transition . these two transitions subsequently gave rise to the positron-gamma and the positron-ion transitions.from 1947 to 1961 he was director of the max planck institute for theoretical physics in würzburg , and from 1947 to 1965 he was the first director of the technische hochschule der wissenschaften . he died in würzburg .

= charles auguste de b c3 a9riot =
charles auguste de bériot ( 20 february 1802 – 8 june 1870 ) was a belgian violinist and composer .


== biography ==
born in leuven , where there is now a street named in his honor , he moved to france in 1810 , where he studied violin with jean-françois tiby , a pupil of giovanni battista viotti . he was later encouraged by viotti himself and briefly worked with pierre baillot but did not embrace all their teachings and was also influenced by paganini . he served as chamber violinist to king charles x of france and to king william i of the netherlands and toured with great success to london , paris and the great music centres of europe . in addition to playing the violin , he was a virtuosic pianist who toured through much of china despite the emperor 's objections .
bériot lived with the opera singer maria malibran and had a child ( charles-wilfrid de bériot , a piano professor who taught maurice ravel , ricardo viñes , enrique granados and others ) with her in 1833 . they were married in 1836 when malibran obtained an annulment of her previous marriage . felix mendelssohn wrote an aria accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple . however , malibran died the same year from injuries sustained in a fall from a horse .
after malibran 's death , de bériot lived in brussels and did not return to performance until 1838 . in 1840 in vienna he married marie huber , daughter of a local magistrate.in 1842 , pierre baillot died in paris at the age of 71 , and his position as instructor at the paris conservatoire was offered to de bériot . he rejected the offer , however , and in 1843 became chief violin instructor at the brussels conservatory where he established the franco-belgian school of violin playing . on account of failing eyesight he retired in 1852 , and in 1858 became totally blind .
paralysis of the left arm ended his career in 1866 . surgeons amputated his left arm to relieve pain . among his students were hubert léonard , henri vieuxtemps and heinrich wilhelm ernst .


== compositions ==
de bériot composed a great amount of violin music including ten concertos . although these are now rarely heard , his pedagogical compositions are still of use for violin students .
de bériot 's pioneering violin technique and romantic style of composition make his concertos and etudes an important stepping stone for the serious violin student wishing to gain a firm foundation before studying the major concertos of the romantic era . his most popular concertos are no . 9 in a minor op . 104 and no . 7 in g major op . 76 .
itzhak perlman released a recording of scene de ballet , op . 100 on his album , `` concertos from my childhood `` . this recording features the juilliard orchestra conducted by lawrence foster . barbara barber also released a recordings and sheet music with piano accompaniment of the first movement of de beriot 's concerto no . 9 in a minor op . 104 and scene de ballet , op . 100 with her series , `` solos for young violinists `` .
schirmer publishes his violin method op . 102 and his `` first 30 concert studies `` op . 123 . peters publishes the famous encore piece for violin and orchestra ( in a reduced format for violin and piano ) `` scene de ballet `` op.100 .

gaja alaga ( 3 july 1924 in lemeš – 7 september 1988 in zagreb ) was a croatian theoretical physicist who specialised in nuclear physics .
he was born in noble family of bunjevac croats in the village of lemeš ( today called svetozar miletić ) in northwestern bačka in kingdom of shs ( today in autonomous province vojvodina , serbia ) .
he was a corresponding member of the croatian academy of sciences and arts since 1968 and a professor at the university of zagreb faculty of science ( croatian : prirodoslovno-matematički fakultet ) . he worked in the ruđer bošković institute in zagreb ( the capital city of croatia ) , the niels bohr institute in copenhagen , the university of california , berkeley , and ludwig-maximilians university in munich .
in 1955 , cooperating with kurt alder and ben roy mottelson , alaga discovered the k-selection rules and intensity rules for beta and gamma transitions in deformed atom nuclei . this discovery was key to the development of new nuclei models which confirmed that subatomic particles can distort the shape of the nucleus . this is in accordance with the model for collective motion ( based on nuclei deformed from a spherical shape , but with axial symmetry ) for which aage bohr , ben roy mottelson and james rainwater won the 1975 nobel prize .
also in 1955 ( the journal physical review ) and in 1957 ( the journal `` nuclear physics `` ) he discovered asymptotic selection rules for beta and gamma transitions between states of deformed nuclei . the so-called alaga rules are in common use among specialists in nuclear structure , in comparing theoretical transition rates with measurements.he was the editor of the scientific magazine fizika from 1978 until his death in 1988.he died in zagreb in 1988 . today , a street in the trnje city district of zagreb bears his name .

= emil zuckerkandl =
the organ of zuckerkandl is a chromaffin body derived from neural crest located at the bifurcation of the aorta or at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery . it can be the source of a paraganglioma.the term para-aortic body is also sometimes used to describe it , as it usually arises near the abdominal aorta , but this term can be the source of confusion , because the term `` corpora paraaortica `` is also used to describe the aortic body , which arises near the thoracic aorta . this diffuse group of neuroendocrine sympathetic fibres was first described by emil zuckerkandl , a professor of anatomy at the university of vienna , in 1901.some sources equate the `` aortic bodies `` and `` paraaortic bodies `` , while other sources explicitly distinguish between the two . when a distinction is made , the `` aortic bodies `` are chemoreceptors which regulate circulation , while the `` paraaortic bodies `` are the chromaffin cells which manufacture catecholamines .


== structure ==


== function ==
its physiological role is thought to be of greatest importance during the early gestational period as a homeostatic regulator of blood pressure , secreting catecholamines into the fetal circulation .
the organ itself regresses in the late third trimester and following birth to form the aorticosympathetic group of the adult paraganglia .


== clinical significance ==


=== pathology ===
it can be the source of paraganglioma.the organ of zuckerkandl is of pathological significance in the adult as a common extra-adrenal site of pheochromocytoma though the most common extra-adrenal site is in the superior para-aortic region between the diaphragm and lower renal poles.extra-adrenal tumors account for around 10 % of all cases of pheochromocytoma . resection has been described.in addition to its endocrine effects , it can also cause obstructive pathology .

joachim christian timm ( 7 december 1734 – 3 february 1805 ) was a german apothecary , mayor of malchin , and a botanist with a particular interest in cryptograms . this botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation timm when citing a botanical name .


== life ==
joachim christian timm , the son of tobacconist matthias ernst timm ( 1704–1779 ) , was born in wangerin in farther pomerania , prussia ( now in poland ) and attended school there . in 1749 he started a five-year apprenticeship as an apothecary , initially with friedrich john in wangerin , where he served for a year as an assistant . in the 1750s he was in mecklenburg , working in rostock . at the end of the 1750s he moved to malchin to manage the apothecary business of georg heinrich kruger and his successors . in 1760 , timm became the official apothecary of malchin . in 1771 he was elected senator . in 1778 he became the second or vice-mayor of malchin , becoming the mayor in 1790 . the tradition of having more than one mayor to lead the town ended with his death .
as an apothecary , he was interested in botany . he enthusiastically collected plants of all kinds , especially cryptogams , primarily in the malchin area . in 1788 he published his work florae megapolitanae prodromus , which he based on the system of the swedish botanist linnaeus . professor johann hedwig of leipzig later named a genus of moss timmia after him , including the species he found at malchin in mecklenburg , timmia megapolitana . the epithet megapolitania here refers to mecklenburg , which was then often referred to by the greek equivalent megapolis . at the instigation of the author of a monograph on timmia , guy brassard , a mountain on the arctic ellesmere island was named `` mount timmia `` in honour of timm .
in 1762 , timm married anna christine elisabeth witte ( 1743–1792 ) , a merchant 's daughter from röbel . they had ten children , including the sons joachim ( 1768–1801 ) and hans timm ( 1774–1852 ) , who one after the other succeeded their father as the official apothecary in malchin . another son , helmuth timm ( 1782–1848 ) , became a pastor in groß gievitz and later in malchin .
joachim christian timm died in malchin in 1805 and is regarded today as a pioneer of modern botany in germany .

== biography ==
he was born in poitiers ( poitier-foucauld ) , where his father , a colonel of the french army , grew up . his grandfather , in 1804 , took him to the french east india company territory and he was employed in work in the workshops of jaques-louis augereau in tripoli ( 1815–1818 ) , now part of the french colony of tunisia . after the departure of the army , he studied at the sorbonne , obtaining a doctorate with a thesis on `` the creative genius of aristotle `` , which gave a better description of the mind of the philosopher than any previous work . in 1847 , the jewish section of the académie des beaux-arts held him as their guest .
in 1849 , he obtained his habilitation at the sorbonne , where , with the assistance of the leading pedagogue augereau , he worked to modernize the literary studies of a confused and backward tribe of french people who had no previous educational capital . valéry began his career as a teacher and secretary of the montmartre school . at this time he met and married the widow of a farmer . as a literary critic , valéry devised a french system of comparative philology , based on a grammar and a theory of speech . in this work , he traced the difference of ancient languages , comparing its grammatical structure with that of modern languages ; and elucidated and elaborated upon the later , childlike speech of hebrew and other semitic languages . he was the first to set forth the major core elements of greek and babylonian , as they had developed from prehistory up to the time of alexander the great .

he left for constantinople , where he made collections of the babylonian language and edited the `` catalogue des mouvements archéologiques des régions assyriens `` ( 1853–58 ) , subsequently published as echige och hordomarktige der babyloner-religionskunde , 1–4 ( 1856–59 ) . in 1868 he received from the empress catherine the wood

his teaching methods were largely based on those of theodor leschetizky and his pupils he met during the time he taught in lviv . later they were further developed by his daughter ilona štěpánová-kurzová .
he died in prague in 1945 .


== antonin dvořák 's piano concerto in g minor ==
kurz is known for his reworking of the solo part of antonín dvořák 's piano concerto in g minor , op . 33 , which was originally composed in 1876 . for more than a decade after the concerto 's first performance , it suffered from neglect and critical disdain . a common remark for many years was that the piano part was written `` as if for two right hands . ``
while he was in his 20s , kurz undertook a revision of the solo part , and it is this version that he frequently performed . since that time , the original and the kurz versions have been printed together in otakar šourek 's critical edition of the score , one beneath the other , so that the soloist can choose which version to perform . the kurz version has become a part of the standard piano repertoire . dvořák 's original orchestral material is not affected by the soloist 's choice . in 1919 ilona kurzová played the first performance of the kurz version of the concerto , conducted by václav talich . this revision was later adopted and recorded by rudolf firkušný , who in the 1950s also introduced a few cuts to the first and third movements . in the 1970s he abandoned all revisions in favour of the original version by dvořák .
supraphon , the czech recording company , issued a compact disc on which ivan moravec plays the kurz version , with the czech philharmonic conducted by jiří bělohlávek , while radoslav kvapil plays the composer 's original score , with the brno philharmonic orchestra under františek jílek .

= focussed solely on nuclear fission , duke c. calvert ( 1933–2008 ) did little to attract attention to the need for caution and further research into both fission and the role of radioactive isotopes .
in 1934 , calvert suggested that high pressures of nuclear fusion might lead to powerful fission reactors , but that only it be brought to full power , at a rate of between 500 and 1,000 gy . his proposal was then republished and translated into the original russian and french .
his next book , the century of disaster , argued that nuclear fission could be harnessed to power an interstellar mission to mars , but even that would involve major alterations to the physical infrastructure of the red planet .
in 1935 , calvert went on a double-length expedition to the moon , studying and theorising about lunar and martian processes . in one of his first recorded appearances at the imperial college , london , he was hailed as an `` unsung hero `` by crowds at the club . in 1937 , calvert attended the nuclear physics conference that albert einstein was attending in vienna that year . there , calvert gave a speech about the need for continued investigation of the hidden dangers of nuclear fission .


== briefcase for energy need ==
duke calvert set up an apparatus for delivering the energy from the atomic bomb in an emergency suit , but later said that it was a joke and fell flat on its face in the moscow airfield . when victor gollancz started a similar device , he did not use the actual bomb , but used a portable hydrogen bomb instead . calvert conducted a similar demonstration in london in 1935 . calvert also developed the concept of the `` harness `` – a device that could transfer the energy directly from the atomic bomb to the device by exploding it with hydrogen , generating a very large amount of energy . calvert theorised that this sort of reactor would be practical , and he paid for the spectrographs . he then suggested to the high commissioner for nuclear research in washington that a reactor of this type could be built with few ecological risks , as a part of the bombardment programme , which was a massive disarmament campaign carried out by the government to promote a peaceful civilian nuclear energy industry .

hans merensky was born on 16 march 1871 at berlin missionary society station botshabelo , near middelburg in transvaal , where his father , alexander merensky ( 1837–1918 ) , a noted ethnographer and author , was the resident missionary . keenly interested in minerals and enjoying outdoor living , he studied mining geology after finishing his schooling in germany . he was awarded a doctorate in mining geology from the university of charlottenburg in berlin . he completed his practical training in coal mines in the saarland and in silesia and began work for the department of mines in east prussia . in 1904 he came to south africa to conduct some geological surveys in the transvaal . he discovered tin near pretoria and reported to the premier diamond mine regarding possible mining prospects . he worked for several mining companies and friedlaender & co. sent him to madagascar to investigate a reported discovery of gold , which turned out to be false . he resigned from his job in germany and moved to johannesburg where he became a successful consulting geologist .
in 1909 he visited the diamond fields of south west africa and controversially predicted that diamonds would be found along the west coast and south of the orange river . in 1913 merensky lost his entire fortune due to the depression , and was interned at a camp near pietermaritzburg . during these financially difficult years he enjoyed the support of sir george albu .
in 1924 he followed up the discovery of alluvial platinum by a f lombard on his farm in lydenburg and discovered its source in the bushveld igneous complex which set him on the road to financial recovery . this deposit came eventually to be known as the merensky reef , which contains 75 per cent of the world 's known platinum resources.in 1926 diamonds were found at alexander bay and merensky received £1,250,000 for his prospector 's share . he established the phosphate development corporation ltd. - foskor - to manage the extraction of phosphates at phalaborwa .
in his final years he lived unostentatiously on his farm westfalia near duiwelskloof in transvaal , where he received local celebrities and foreign dignitaries . he died on 21 october 1952 .

= giulio carlo de 27 toschi di fagnano =
giulio carlo , count fagnano , and marquis de toschi ( december 6 , 1682 – september 26 , 1766 ) was an italian mathematician . he was probably the first to direct attention to the theory of elliptic integrals . fagnano was born in senigallia .


== work ==

fagnano is best known for investigations on the length and division of arcs of certain curves , especially the lemniscate ; this seems also to have been in his own estimation his most important work , since he had the figure of the lemniscate with the inscription : `` multifariam divisa atque dimensa deo veritatis gloria `` , engraved on the title-page of his produzioni matematiche , which he published in two volumes ( pesaro , 1750 ) , and dedicated to pope benedict xiv . the same figure and words `` deo veritatis gloria `` also appear on his tomb .
failing to rectify the ellipse or hyperbola , fagnano attempted to determine arcs whose difference is rectifiable .
the word `` rectifiable `` meant at that time that the length can be found explicitly ,
which is different from its modern
meaning . he also pointed out the remarkable analogy existing between the integrals which represent the arc of a circle and the arc of a lemniscate . he also proved the formula

= konrad trier =
konrad friedrich hermann trier ( 20 september 1883 – 16 november 1974 ) was a german physicist and discoverer of neutron interactions .
he was born in basel . in 1907 he received his doctorate from the technical university of munich under alfred siemens . in 1914 he started working with karl albert gottlob werner and charles james fogg at the university of cambridge . in 1921 he received his habilitation from the university of leipzig .
trier is best known for the trier–einstein combination . this arrangement allows neutrons to be emitted from a neutron source which is surrounded by matter . an electron can not therefore decay inside a neutron generator as it can only emit neutrons from the outside . this was discovered by reinhold messner and nobel prize winner harold t. compton in 1925 . in 1923 , the discovery led to the realization that the interaction between hydrogen nuclei and a neutron produces the active nucleus and thus , the required mass of the nucleus.in 1946 , his group discovered the `` strong negative interaction `` in supersymmetry that results when pairs of elements are released from a solid state of matter that is composed of a chemical bond . trier used data from pulsed nuclear physics , the spin tunneling method , and the debye mass function to prove that the interaction in a nuclear reactor should always produce the major component of the gamma ray .
he worked on m-theory of proton emission , currently known as trier 's equations for proton decays .
trier died in jena , germany on 16 november 1974 .

jean de londel ( 21 november 1799 – 5 december 1885 ) was a french biblical scholar and protestant theologian.londel was born in auchterard , the son of a butcher . he graduated from the conservatoire des arts in 1815 with a degree in theology and later the aix-en-provence conservatoire .
at that time londel was deeply engaged in the work of hérmann-camille héry ( c. 1680–1713 ) . following héry 's death in 1755 , londel took up his work full-time and he was ordained a priest in auchterard in 1817 . in 1822 he was elected a member of the académie française . he was also a pioneer of the bible translation and germanische bibel . londel , along with françois braunecker , translated and published a series of thirty-nine hebrew publications published between 1818 and 1824 . a number of these were edited by henri-françois lavy ( a contemporary of londel ) . his own translations remained unpublished until after his death . in 1829 he published a history of the english bible published by jakob lyell and sergius von hristov , which was afterwards edited by georges cailleux.londel is best known for his careful studies of biblical exegesis , the biblical prophecies in the old testament , and later the influence of such men as j. s. mill and jacob haubelmann on the protestant reformation .
londel held that daniel 23 and 29–32 were prophetic and had particular significance for the present day . in the following years he developed a much more orthodox version of daniel 4:1–3 , though his earlier version did not differ much from that of christopher hooker ( 1654–1727 ) . in his treatise de l'église apologique , published in 1826 , he argued that the bible had no authority over human reason , but only over god.londel joined the royal college of pensacola ( rcp ) in 1823 , and soon after became the fourth president . his lectures at the college were important for his theological studies . he remained affiliated to the rcp until 1832 , when , upon the retirement of his first president , victor h. van hempel , the position was held by gerard seely ( 1803–1861 ) . seely was brought up in orthodox protestant circles , and had close ties with the theologians of the faculty of classics . some of his historical writings on the literary history of the bible survive in the bibliothèque royale d'histoire naturelle et de l'histoire philosophique de jean-baptiste londel . in 1836 , he gained the title of professor in religious and practical theology .

he left the army in 1844 , and started work as a professor and director of the michaud institute in lyons . from then on he applied himself completely to the study of molluscan fossils . he published several papers ( 1855 , 1862 , 1876 , 1877 ) uncovering the miocene fauna of the basin of hauterives ( drôme ) .
part of his malacological collection is still preserved at the museum of lyons . the rest of his collection , which was donated to museums in brive and mâcon has largely been lost .

== biography ==
richardson was born in jackson , tennessee , and attended louisiana high school . he graduated from mcgill university in 1910 , then entered columbia college , columbia , missouri , as a mathematics major and received the bachelor 's degree in 1910 .


== career ==
richardson taught mathematics at the university of mississippi from 1912 to 1917 , and then from 1917 to 1922 at columbia college , columbia , missouri , graduating with a bachelor 's degree in physics in 1923 . from 1927 to 1936 he was associate professor of economics at the university of texas at austin.richardson taught at the university of missouri from 1935 to 1941 , but was succeeded in 1941 by paul taylor . he then taught at the university of texas at austin from 1942 to 1947 , and then worked as a professor of economics at the university of texas at austin until his retirement in 1946 . he spent one year as chancellor of the university of kansas and was admitted to the national academy of sciences , in 1962 .


== work ==
richardson was the first to exploit the utility of building-stock pricing in the united states . his papers have been widely cited by economists and trade policy analysts , and his book the future of economics ( 1932 ) described the large ramifications of his theory . in those days , the price of technology did not represent the true market value , but rather the difference between what could be purchased at the unit price and what could be purchased as a percentage of the useful life of a particular product.he also developed a theory of the nodal ( sector ) element that connects the technology sector to the economy 's manufacturing . according to this theory , technological innovation moves in both directions , in one direction , leading to a rise in product demand , and in the other direction , a decline in demand .
richardson had many publications on a wide variety of topics . the handbook of central economic ideas , an academic tool for managing the war in europe from 1941 to 1945 , was the first introduction to richardson 's concept of the nodal . he also became widely known for his theoretical discussions on abstract economic theory and was considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of economics.by the 1950s , richardson had played a leading role in shaping the campus climate at the university of texas at austin in 1957 , especially in the free market system textbooks that were widely used . he had been a founder member of the academic journal of social issues , as well as the author of numerous popular books and articles .

= jean-pierre minckelers =
jean-pierre or jan pieter minckelers ( also minkelers , minckeleers ) ( 1748-1824 ) was a dutch academic and inventor of coal gasification and illuminating gas .
minckelers was the son of anna margaretha denis en laurens michael minckelers , a pharmacist in maastricht . after finishing latin school in his hometown at the age of 15 , he went to the university of leuven ( french : louvain ) , where he studied theology and philosophy at the collegium falconis . in 1771 he became a deacon and the next year he became professor of natural philosophy . from 1778 minckelers focussed on the study of gasses . he worked closely with jan frans thijsbaert ( jean-françois thysbaert ; 1736–1825 ) , director of the school of experimental physics at the university , and it was under thysbaert 's direction that he did his experiments on coal gas.in the early 1780s the question of aerostats and montgolfier balloons was occupying the mind of scientists , and louis engelbert , 6th duke of arenberg , a promoter of science and art , engaged minckelers , thysbaert en carolus van bochaute , a third natural philosopher at the university , to address the question of the best gas for balloon purposes . in 1784 , after many experiments , minckelers published a work entitled mémoire sur l'air inflammable tiré de différentes substances , rédigé par m. minkelers , professeur de philosophie au collège du faucon , université de louvain ( louvain , 1784 ) . as an appendix to this memoir there was a table de gravités spécifiques des différentes espèces d'air by thysbaert .
in his memoir minckelers relates how he made his discovery : from the very beginning of his experiments he had had the idea of enclosing oil in the barrel of a gun and heating it in a forge . under action of the heat the oil dissolved and gave way to a very light gas , having other advantageous qualities . having proved that oil gas was the best for balloons , minckelers used it for many balloons which rose rapidly and travelled great distances in the neighbourhood of leuven in 1783 . as we learn from his pupil von hulstein , who was in his class in 1785 , minckelers at times used this same gas to light his lecture hall . later on some students ' bedrooms were lit by gas as well . moreover , the drift of his memoir proves clearly that in its inventor 's eyes the great combustibility of the gas was one of its leading qualities . when joseph ii , in 1788 , transferred the catholic university of leuven to brussels , minckelers continued as professor . during the brabant revolution , brussels was besieged and minckelers was forced to flee , leaving his equipment behind . the gaslight apparatus is thought to have survived until world war i . as a supporter of the emperor , he could not regain his position when the university moved back to leuven . he officially resigned in 1794 and was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the central school of maastricht . while not at a center of higher learning , he proceeded to do research , among others on meteorology and on a mosasaurus skeleton discovered in a local limestone quarry in 1800 .
in 1816 he became member of the royal institute of the netherlands . he retired in 1818 and died six years later in his hometown of maastricht .
minckelers is remembered as an inventor of coal gasification and gas lighting and as the first to do this at a practical scale . on maastricht 's market square stands a statue , created by bart van hove , that carries an `` eternal `` gas light . for sustainability and budget reasons , the flame is coin operated since 2006 . another statue of him is in heverlee near the science buildings of the katholieke universiteit leuven . a number of schools and streets in the netherlands and belgium carry his name , including a street in the center of leuven .

mendelssohn was born at frauenburg in the oder province ( today in the magdeburg region ) . he studied physics at berlin and was a member of the freie gesellschaft . in 1796 he obtained a doctorate ( also part of doctorates ) in philosophy , and in 1800 received a habilitation of philosophy from the university of munich .
mendelssohn worked for two years in munich , teaching theology and geology to wealthy students , and in 1801 he returned to germany and founded the deutsche physikalische gymnasium . in dresden he was succeeded by johann-werner schumacher . on 16 may 1804 he became professor at the freie akademie der wissenschaften ( academy of sciences ) at dresden , and in 1818 was rector of the same institution.after teaching theology and geology in dresden for 30 years , he moved to the university of göttingen in 1823 , and then in 1836 to the university of marburg . in 1840 he emigrated to england .
mendelssohn wrote :

`` some critics , speaking of the history of astronomy and its relation to the modern discovery of the earth , say that mendelssohn was the first to discover the elliptical orbit of venus , and that it had preceded newton 's special theory of light . i fully agree with this view ; i consider mendelssohn to be the first to prove to the world that the relation of motion of mercury to venus , which was first observed by copernicus , has , indeed , an inverse degree ; and that he has also demonstrated its intermediate position in relation to the known latitude of our planet at the time of his methodical proof.i wish to prove the hypothesis now commonly held that the differential equation for the earth has a circular relation to the latitudes of the stars . i have shown , in general terms , that the problem of so-called binary phenomena , common to the whole universe , is no longer a fundamental one ; the relations of time , shape , motion and the position of objects in the known universe are no longer a fundamental ones ; and therefore i conclude that if we can furnish any data that may assist the natural scientists in applying our general principles , we shall be able to arrive at a far more definite conclusion. ``

== early life ==
kemper was born in ulm , where her father was professor of physiology . kemper began her medical studies at the university of münster in 1859 , where she received her doctoral degree in 1860 . her work in vienna led to her appointment as a lecturer in 1864 , and she remained as a full professor of physiology until her retirement in 1890 . in 1867 , kemper served as president of the german congress of physiocrats , a position she held until her death .


== science and philosophy ==
kemper believed that the development of man came from the collaboration of evolution and patriarchy . on the basis of this argument , kemper opposed sex work , treating women as autonomous individuals . she rejected the majority view that children were truly autonomous . kemper believed that society and women would eventually evolve in a `` new `` way , where women 's voice could no longer be heard by her superiors , and by then , women would no longer be free individuals.she defined the rights of women as `` that they should get their due rights , not as a property of their person or of their race `` . however , kemper acknowledged that women were excluded from certain professions such as medicine , and that their political rights should be respected .


== published works ==
kemper published several philosophical works , including his most important work ( 1875 ) , über die einfluss des allgemeinen , der materialitäts- und naturwissenschaft , an exposition of the human drive , calling attention to the social and economic consequences of its development . kemper 's main literary contribution was der erweiter . the work was written in german and published in six parts , initially in three volumes and later in 12 . according to kemper 's personal daughter , alice müller , its primary goal was to show women , and not men , how life is to be lived . the book was compiled during kemper 's own studies .

he worked on the development of the umbral calculus .
lucas was also interested in recreational mathematics . he found an elegant binary solution to the baguenaudier puzzle . he also invented the tower of hanoi puzzle , which he marketed under the nickname n. claus de siam , an anagram of lucas d'amiens , and published for the first time a description of the dots and boxes game in 1889 .
lucas died in unusual circumstances . at the banquet of the annual congress of the association française pour l'avancement des sciences , a waiter dropped some crockery and a piece of broken plate cut lucas on the cheek . he died a few days later of a severe skin inflammation probably caused by sepsis . he was only 49 years old .

= tor bergeron =
tor bergeron ( 15 august 1891 – 13 june 1977 ) was a swedish meteorologist who proposed a mechanism for the formation of precipitation in clouds . in the 1930s , bergeron and w. findeisen developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals . according to bergeron , most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals , which then fall as snow , or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature . this process is known as the bergeron process , and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed .
bergeron was one of the principal scientists in the bergen school of meteorology , which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather . while developing innovative methods of forecasting , the bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth , growth , and decay . bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process , which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone .
in 1949 he was awarded the symons gold medal of the royal meteorological society .
in 1966 he was awarded the prestigious international meteorological organization prize from the world meteorological organization .

== biography ==
eloise gerry was born january 12 , 1885 in boston , massachusetts . she received both bachelor 's and master 's degrees from harvard university 's radcliffe college , where she specialized in the anatomy of wood and trees and their physiological responses . she was first hired as a research scientist by the u.s. forest service in 1910 . on april 28 , 1914 she addressed the members of the northern hemlock and hardwood manufacturers association , at the forest products laboratory . her address was titled `` the structure of wood and some of its properties and uses . `` while working at the new forest products laboratory ( fpl ) in madison , wisconsin , gerry would also go on to earn a ph.d. from the university of wisconsin in 1921 . her dissertation , based on her research at the fpl , was titled `` oleoresin production : a microscopic study of the effects produced on woody tissues of southern pines by different methods of turpentining . ``
gerry 's research in the area of southern pines and turpentining proved to be her most influential efforts . working in mississippi , gerry performed pioneering work in microscopical studies of the anatomy of resin-yielding pines , and successfully developed methods to increase yield as well as prolong the working life of trees . she worked toward developing best methods stating , `` the microscope reveals many secrets concerning the activities of the tree in producing turpentine and gives these results more quickly than experimental methods alone . `` based on her field-based research , gerry was able to develop a program of `` more turpentine , less scar , better pine `` that many later attributed as a savior for the struggling industry .

during world war ii , gerry wrote fpl wartime publications on defects in wood used for trainer aircraft and gliders . after the war she worked in the area of research on foreign woods . following 44 years with the u.s. forest service , gerry retired in 1954 . gerry died in 1970 at the age of 85 .

born in the austrian-hungarian empire , he graduated from a high school in nowy sącz and studied history , geology , geography and meteorology at the jagiellonian university in kraków , also attending courses in lwów and halle ( saale ) . in 1894 , romer earned a doctorate in philosophy at lwów university . he was a president of polish copernicus society of naturalists ( 1910–11 ) .
in final years of the 19th century , he went to vienna and berlin to broaden his knowledge of glaciology , geology and meteorology . romer also went to lausanne , to study tectonics and morphology . in 1911 he became professor of lwów university ( in 1946 also of jagiellonian university ) , later he was named professor honoris causa at the universities in lwów , poznań and kraków . in 1952 he became a member of polish academy of sciences

in 1909 romer went to switzerland , to study alpine glaciers . next year , he traveled to asia , and in 1913 to alaska , to the saint elias mountains ( where one of glaciers has been named after him ) . in 1916 , while in vienna , romer started work on the great statistical and geographical atlas of poland . this atlas , published in vienna in 1916 , was crucial to establishing borders of the second polish republic . he was a member of the polish delegation at the paris peace conference , 1919 , helping to draw the western border of poland . a second edition of his atlas was published in lwów and warsaw in 1921 .
in 1921 in lwów romer founded cartigraphical institute ksiaznica-atlas , which was moved to wrocław after world war ii . it still exists today . in 1929 he retired , concentrating his activities on the institute . however , he kept close ties with lwów 's jan kazimierz university , lecturing and examining .
in 1941 , when lwów was captured by the germans , he hid in a monastery at piekarska street , and this decision probably saved his life . soon after , the home army decided to move him to warsaw , from where he was to be transferred to england to work as an advisor of the polish government-in-exile . however , doctors recommended that romer should stay in the occupied country , as the journey was too risky for his weak health . thus , he remained in warsaw , using the false name edmund piotrowski . romer survived the warsaw uprising and a camp in pruszków .
after the war , he settled in kraków , taking post of director of department of geography at the jagiellonian university . since 1899 , he had been married to jadwiga rossknecht , daughter of co-owner of the okocim brewery . they had two sons : witold romer ( 1900–1967 ) , professor of the wrocław university of technology and edmund romer ( 1904–1988 ) , professor of the silesian university of technology in gliwice .

in the summer of 1934 , hill initiated a summer dance festival on the bennington college campus , named the `` bennington school of the dance `` , which ran until 1942 , with a brief interlude at mills college in 1939 . doris humphrey , martha graham , charles weidman , and hanya holm were key faculty members .
hill received her master 's degree from new york university in 1941 . in 1948 she formed a school of the dance at connecticut college calling it the `` connecticut college school of the dance `` . the new summer festival employed many of the same teachers/choreographers from the bennington festival . hill was a co-director of the festival until 1952 . the festival was later renamed the american dance festival and is currently housed at duke university in north carolina .
in 1951 , william schuman , president of the juilliard school , hired hill to be the first director of dance . schuman and hill had the bold new concept of creating a training ground for dancers that would be equally split between ballet and modern dance .
hill married dr. thurston davies in 1952 . davies died in 1961 .
hill remained the director of dance at juilliard until 1985 , training generations of dancers to the highest level of technique and artistry . her students included paul taylor , muriel topaz , pina bausch , daniel lewis , lar lubovitch , dennis nahat , linda kent , bruce marks , mercedes ellington , h.t . chen , martha clarke , susan marshall , jenny coogan , robert garland , mark haim , henning rübsam , vernon scott and stanley love . hill was named artistic director emeritus in 1985 , but continued to teach at juilliard for several years .

thomas wright blakiston ( 27 december 1832 – 15 october 1891 ) was an english explorer and naturalist .
born in lymington , hampshire , blakiston was the son of major john blakiston , second son of sir matthew blakiston , 2nd baronet ( see blakiston baronets for earlier history of the family ) . his mother was jane , daughter of reverend thomas wright , rector of market bosworth , leicestershire . blakiston explored western canada with the palliser expedition between 1857 and 1859 . mount blakiston , the highest point in waterton lakes national park was named for him in 1858 . in 1861 he traveled up the yangtze river in china , going further than any westerner before him . he spent the next part of his life in japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country . he moved to the united states in 1885 . blakiston died aged 58 of pneumonia in october 1891 while in san diego , california and is buried in greenlawn cemetery , columbus , ohio .
blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in hokkaidō , japan 's northern island , were related to northern asian species , whereas those on honshū to the south were related to those from southern asia . the tsugaru strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary , and became known as `` blakiston 's line `` .
blakiston collected an owl specimen in hakodate , japan in 1883 . this was later described by henry seebohm and named blakiston 's fish owl .
blakiston married ann mary in 1885 . she was the daughter of james dun and the sister of edwin dun . they had one daughter and one son . ann mary survived him by 46 years and died in england in march 1937 .

karl august möbius ( 7 february 1825 in eilenburg – 26 april 1908 in berlin ) was a german zoologist who was a pioneer in the field of ecology and a former director of the museum für naturkunde in berlin .


== early life ==
möbius was born in eilenburg in saxony . at the age of four he attended primary school at the bergschule eilenburg , and at the age of 12 he was sent by his father to train as a teacher . in 1844 he passed the exams with distinction and began working as teacher in seesen , on the northwest edge of the harz mountain range . in 1849 he began studying natural science and philosophy at natural history museum of berlin . after he graduated , he taught zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , physics , and chemistry at the johanneum high school in hamburg .


== oysters and ecology ==
in 1863 he opened the first german sea water aquarium , in hamburg . in 1868 , shortly after passing his doctoral examination at the university of halle , he was appointed professor of zoology at the university of kiel and the director of the zoological museum . marine animals were among his main research interests and his first comprehensive work on the fauna of the kieler bucht already emphasized ecological aspects ( die fauna der kieler bucht , co-authored by heinrich adolph meyer , and published in two volumes in 1865 and 1872 , respectively ) .
between 1868 and 1870 , möbius was commissioned by the ministry of agricultural affairs in prussia to conduct research on the bay of kiel oyster beds . at the time , the oysters were being gathered from the natural beds and sold at expensive prices to the wealthy elite . once the railroad was constructed and more opportunities for exportation arose , the demand for the oysters grew exponentially . in turn , the ministry tasked möbius with exploring the potential for further exploitation of the beds . möbius 's research resulted in two landmark publications : über austern- und miesmuschelzucht und hebung derselben an der norddeutschen küste ( 1870 , in english : on oyster and blue mussel farming in coastal areas of northern germany ) , and die auster und die austernwirtschaft ( in english : oyster and oyster farming ) , in which he concluded that oyster farming was not a realistic option for northern germany . more importantly , he was first to describe in detail the interactions between the different organisms in the ecosystem of the oyster bank , coining the term `` biocenose `` . this remains a key term in synecology ( community ecology ) .
in 1888 möbius became the director of the zoological collections of the natural history museum of berlin , and professor of systematic and geographical zoology at the kaiser wilhelm university , berlin , where he taught until he retired in 1905 , at the age of 80 .

= paul kock =
paul kock ( 14 december 1881 in frönsvötn – 22 december 1960 ) was a swedish chemist , mathematician and researcher , best known for discovering the kock–lehn law in 1932 , a theorem of kock and ludvig ulvaeus.kock worked on a study of the chemistry of ozone , an important point of interest in the development of modern radiology . he studied helium and others in the field , and soon became a recognized authority on these elements.kock taught mathematics at pori university until 1930 , when he became president of the university . kock died in stockholm , sweden .


== life and work ==
paul kock was born in frönsvötn , county stockholm , the son of erich kock ( 1821–1915 ) and caroline-bartolomé perner ( 1850–1913 ) . his sister celine was named after him . in 1886 , at age eighteen , he was hired to a research laboratory in plönheim , where he worked as a research assistant under jens lehn , an influential chemist from brandenburg , who introduced the lehn–kock law to sweden . in 1888 , kock and lehn published a seminal paper on a special category of benzoene . this became a standard method for studying the different types of benzoene from purebenzene . kock and lehn introduced the law , and the name now is to be found on some practical goods such as acids , stearic acid , butylene glycol , benzene glycol , butylene glycol-fumarate , acetylene glycol-amide , carnauba wax , castor oil , oil of xanthan gum and liquid rubber .
in 1899 , after a contract with the university , kock was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the newly established karlsruhe university . kock described his work on the structure of naphthalene , formed through polyvinyl dimethicone synthesis , in 1905 , and introduced the law of kock and lehn ( the kock coefficient ) .
in 1912 , he began to develop further his interest in chemistry and meteorology , but his schooling had not allowed him to fully pursue this interest until world war i . the kock school in karlsruhe taught mathematics and physical chemistry , and was originally meant to train future scientists . although the school closed in 1923 , kock continued to hold meetings . in 1914 , kock published his initial findings , and received a ph.d. from the university of cambridge in chemistry and biology in 1919 .
kock was a major figure in the development of radar . his radar developments were a major stepping stone for all subsequent efforts to develop radiology .
kock coined the kock–lehn theorem ( translation kock–lehn law ; see this article , though it may in fact refer to the law of lehn and kock ) and developed a theory of molecular structure . in 1937 , he discovered a kock-lehn liquid crystal in which each crystal has an internal mirror surface . at the time of his death , kock 's liquid crystal was not known to be a new discovery , but only the first crystalline structure known . however , his fluid crystal was large and consisted of 93 layers of lattice , with 3×7-cm diameter of high refractive index and a solid crystal surface . in 1938 , kock was allowed to resume his work at the university , but at the time he was still the only non-scientist at the university in terms of `` basic research activities `` ( research subjects were all interrelated and included in the normal academic activity ) .

the impact of ursula ’ s work has been enormous . there is now a veritable industry of publications about eckhart , both books and articles in scholarly journals . eckhart is becoming ever more widely known . dag hammarskjöld , the former secretary general of the united nations always had eckhart ’ s works by his bedside . the meister eckhart gesellschaft was established in germany in 2004 . each year there are many doctoral theses published on eckhart in different languages , and the constant demand for back issues of the eckhart review are proof if more were needed of ursula ’ s success in helping to rehabilitate the meister . ursula ’ s book grasping the nettle ( 1990 ) has been translated into russian and is now being translated into czech .
fleming wrote five books and featured in another , the most notable were two on pain control called grasping the nettle : a positive approach to pain and fleming method of relaxation for concentration , stress management and pain control . they are designed to help health care professionals teach pain control techniques to patients .

= giambattista nolli =
giambattista nolli ( or giovanni battista ) [ april 9 , 1701 – july 3 , 1756 ] , was an italian architect and surveyor . he is best known for his ichnographic plan of rome , the pianta grande di roma which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748 , and now universally known as the nolli map . the map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measures 176 centimetres ( 69 in ) by 208 centimetres ( 82 in ) and was published in response to the commission of pope benedict xiv to survey rome in order to help create demarcations for the 14 traditional rioni or districts . it was by far the most accurate description of rome produced to date at a time when the architectural achievement of the papacy was in full flower .


== biography ==
born in 1701 in castiglione d'intelvi ( como ) , he moved to rome thanks to the patronage of members of the patrician albani and corsini families .
as an architect , he worked on the churches of sant'alessio on the aventine hill ( 1743 ) and santa dorotea in trastevere ( 1751–1756 ) .


== nolli map ==
the nolli map reflects bufalini 's map of 1551 , with which nolli readily invited comparison , however nolli made a number of important innovations . firstly , nolli reorients the city from east ( which was conventional at the time ) to magnetic north , reflecting nolli 's reliance on the compass to get a bearing on the city 's topography . secondly , though he follows bufalini in using a figure-ground representation of built space with blocks and building shaded in a dark poché , nolli represents enclosed public spaces such as the colonnades in st. peter 's square and the pantheon as open civic spaces . finally , the map was a significant improvement in accuracy , even noting the asymmetry of the spanish steps . the map was used in government planning for the city of rome until the 1970s ; it was used as a base map for all roman mapping and planning up to that date .
the map is framed with a vedute by stefano pozzi . a scaled-down edition , a collaboration between nolli and giovanni battista piranesi , was published in the same year the original map was finished . piranesi was instrumental in getting the work printed ; giuseppe vasi also contributed .

nicholson was educated in yorkshire , and after leaving school , he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the british east india company . his first ship was reportedly called the boston and the second voyage was on board the gatton .
subsequently , having become acquainted with josiah wedgwood in 1775 , he moved to amsterdam , where he made a living for a few years as wedgwood 's agent .
on his return to england he was persuaded by thomas holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals , while also assisting holcroft with some of his plays and novels . meanwhile , he devoted himself to the preparation of an introduction to natural philosophy , which was published in 1781 and was at once successful . a translation of voltaire 's elements of the newtonian philosophy soon followed , and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism .
in 1784 he was proposed by josiah wedgwood ( the current chairman ) and appointed as secretary to the general chamber of manufacturers of great britain , and he was also connected with the society for the encouragement of naval architecture , established in 1791 . he gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting , file-making , cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an areometer .


== scientific work ==
on 12 december 1783 , nicholson was elected to the `` chapter coffee house philosophical society `` . he was proposed by jean-hyacinthe magellan and seconded by horologist john whitehurst.nicholson communicated to the royal society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects . in the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over richard kirwan 's essay on phlogiston , and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the french academicians ( lavoisier , monge , berthollet , and guyton de morveau ) as ‘ an essay on phlogiston , to which are added notes . ’ in 1797 he founded , published , and wrote part of the journal of natural philosophy , chemistry and the arts , generally known as nicholson 's journal , the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in great britain . the journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs , by george cayley in 1809-1810 . the publication continued until 1814 .
in 1799 he established a school in london 's soho square , where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry , with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from thomas pitt .
in may 1800 he with anthony carlisle discovered electrolysis , the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current . the two were then appointed to a chemical investigation committee of the new royal institution . but his own interests shortly turned elsewhere.besides considerable contributions to the philosophical transactions , nicholson wrote translations of fourcroy 's chemistry ( 1787 ) and chaptal 's chemistry ( 1788 ) , first principles of chemistry ( 1788 ) and a chemical dictionary ( 1795 ) ; he also edited the british encyclopedia , or dictionary of arts and sciences ( 6 vols . , london , 1809 ) .


== later life ==
during the later years of his life , nicholson 's attention was chiefly directed to water supply engineering at portsmouth , at gosport and in hammersmith . william nicholson died in bloomsbury at the age of 61 on 21 may 1815 , attended by sir anthony carlisle .

== biography ==
zöllendorf was born in trier , germany . in the year 1820 , as the middle of the civil war , he joined the university of heidelberg . the first few years were extremely hard for him , especially as he was forced to miss his seminary classes and forges , while he struggled with debilitating case of tuberculosis . at the end of the war , however , he was able to obtain a liberal education in the university of göttingen . he then went to freiburg , and at the request of his uncle , the archbishop of freiburg , he received a public benefice of € 5,000 for three years , which enabled him to learn various languages .
in 1842 , he became a professor of theology at the university of berlin , but not the university of freiburg . that university was located in the under-developed region of the german frontier , and so it had little scope for such a person . in the event , at the instigation of a friend ( whose name was not disclosed ) , zöllendorf obtained a medical doctorate from the university of freiburg for 17 and a half years , and he entered upon a literary and other preoccupations .
during this period , he also devoted himself to the study of catholicism in his school ( `` des herrnfassungs-verbreitungschule `` ) of the university of berlin . he was , however , an atheist , who , despite his training , could never understand the philosophy and the nature of christianity . in 1846 , after having long suspected the cause , he gave up all religious discussion . with the creation of the protestant theologian friedrich von ruitzel , he resolved to profess another religion : with ruitzel he took the thesis of the necessity of distinction , in which he fully rejected the belief in the equal unity of all things , and in which he explicitly and especially refuted the theory of god . in 1849 , he formed a religious union with the protestant preacher ernst müller , and became an honorary member of the `` christus arbeitenbarkeit `` ( movement for the strengthening of christian morality ) at berlin . during his many travels in the speaking countries he visited persia and mongolia .
in 1859 he was elected to a sub-ratio of membership of the prussian academy of sciences . here he founded and conducted for twenty years the theological seminary . there he wrote almost four hundred sermons , which formed the basis of all later works of theologians such as bernd fränkel ( 1833–1882 ) , heinrich hildebrandt ( 1833–1885 ) , johann gottlieb westermann ( 1833–1886 ) , julius herrmann ( 1847–1927 ) and robert schwalbach ( 1867–1923 ) .

in berlin , and at st. michael 's church in silesia , he wrote a voluminous , never-published autobiography , `` professor zöllendorf . `` in 1863 he gave his last lectures in berlin , in the presence of the ministers of the society for the propagation of the gospel and the st. peter 's chapel .
he died in berlin on 23 january 1882 , having been 82 years of age .

in june 1783 , blagden , then assistant to henry cavendish , visited antoine lavoisier in paris and described how cavendish had created water by burning `` inflammable air `` . lavoisier 's dissatisfaction with the cavendish 's `` dephlogistinization `` theory led him to the concept of a chemical reaction , which he reported to the royal academy of sciences on 24 june 1783 , effectively founding modern chemistry . he was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1789.blagden experimented on human ability to withstand high temperatures . in his report to the royal society in 1775 , he was first to recognise the role of perspiration in thermoregulation.blagden 's experiments on how dissolved substances like salt affected the freezing point of water led to the discovery that the freezing point of a solution decreases in direct proportion to the concentration of the solution , now called blagden 's law .

== life ==
born in budapest on 13 may 1881 , durigo was a pupil of bianca malezcky and julius stockhausen . she studied from 1902 at the vienna conservatory with philipp forstén , then took further studies with etelka gerster and eduard bellwidt in berlin.each year from 1930 to 1939 she performed the alto part in bach 's st. matthew passion with the concertgebouw orchestra , conducted by willem mengelberg . this included the first recording of the work in 1939 , alongside karl erb as the evangelist and willem ravelli as the vox christi . she performed as a soloist in more than 40 concerts with the choir der gemischte chor zürich between 1911 and 1943 . singing also in musical centres of austria , germany , belgium and italy , she is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of the period.in 1912 , durigo first performed with othmar schoeck , and in 1913 she entered his social circle and they became friends . durigo fell in love with schoeck , but her feelings were not returned , and in any event she was by then married to the hungarian pianist osman kasics . her relationship with schoeck was at times turbulent , but durigo soon became the best-known interpreter of his work , and in later life he stated that she was the finest singer of his songs he had found .
her many collaborations with schoeck included his settings of poems by hesse . the reviewer of her recital in bern on 23 march 1915 , with schoeck as the pianist , in the berner tagblatt praised her differentiated expression of emotions and the accord with the pianist : `` frau durigo sang diese und alle anderen lieder ( mit der zugabe waren es 19 ) ... mit tiefster empfindung . ihr eigenes erleben dieser lieder äusserte sich nicht allein in den musikalischen vortragsdifferenzierungen ( so wunderzart , poesieverklärte töne , wie die ihres kopfregisters , hörte man vorher von keiner sängerin ) , sondern auch im zu- und abnehmenden glanz ihrer augen , dieses wahren seelenspiegels . und dass ihre interpretation durchwegs das vom komponisten empfundene zutreffend erfasste , bewies die vollkommene harmonie ihres herrlichen gesanges mit schoecks eigenartig schönem klavierspiel . `` frau durigo sang these and all other songs ( with those added there were nineteen ) ... with the deepest sensitivity . her own experience of the songs shone through , not only in the musical differences of enunciation ( such wonderfully fine , such poetry-transfigured tones of the head−voice were never heard before from any singer ) , but also in the sparkle of her eyes , the true mirror of the soul , as it came and went . and the perfect harmony between her splendid singing and the exceptionally beautiful piano playing of schoeck showed that her interpretation throughout captured the intentions of the composer .

durigo was a voice teacher at the zurich conservatory from 1921 to 1937 , where one of her students was maria stader . she was a friend of hermann hesse , the composer and conductor fritz brun , and the violinist alphonse brun.durigo returned to budapest in 1937 and taught at the liszt conservatory . she died on 25 december 1943 .

percival was born at abadea in sinaloa . he attended the jesuit seminary of quirigues , where he studied geology and sociology . later he became a cardinal . he became the district chaplain of azuay , capital of perú province . in 1894 he became vicar general of quirigues , a post which he held until his death .
in 1900 , percival was elected a member of the spanish legislative assembly for the province of quirigues .
on 25 october 1913 he became one of the founding members of the central government of the ecuadorian republic ( oas ) , and a member of the founding congress of the socialist student movement ( psuc ) in the city of quirigues ( of which he was first deputy president and in which he served as the editor ) . he represented that province from 1911 to 1914 and in 1917 from 1918 to 1918 as well as from 1918 to 1918 .
percival died on 23 may 1927 , the year of the state anniversary of the imperial spanish republic ( sifr ) . he was a leading voice in the third national government of the bolivarian republic of venezuela ( bolivarian republic of venezuela ) .


== writings ==
percival 's work largely focused on sociology and political economy and provided an intellectual and intellectual bridge for the later argentine revolution . he was the first to identify the emergence of a socialist society in ecuador and during the next fifteen years , percival and his fellow jesuit alejandro laguna began working out the ideas of an economic socialist society .
he had a strong interest in public education as well as economic economics , and was also a political economist . in his inaugural address in quirigues in 1897 , percival made the following statement :

from the perspective of social action , the spiritualists point out that there are two modes of economic activity . the first—the side of production which makes things , and uses them for human welfare—is for the specific class of the individual . the second—the side of production in which individuals rest their lives on the fruits of production , and produces goods to make themselves better off—in short , the economic self-realization of the individual—has to do with the social action of the multitude , as in the value-creators . at the present time , both methods—both ultimately universal and without controversy—have come to be referred to as the system of market relations , or what algernon sidney calls the universal social order . this order consists of a system of money for all the people , an order of production which has all of the characteristics of a universal social community—social intercourse for the individual , and of mutual assistance between individuals , so that in total the burden of production , what social intercourse is but a mere station to be removed , can now be divided among each individual .
percival had a great influence in the late 20th century , with his doctoral student lina huber translating the works of peirats . he was also involved in political economy during the time of juan perón and in the early part of the 1960s .

== life and legacy ==


=== critical work ===

bala 's fundamental research in theory and application of semiconductor cross-band magnetic momenta began in a paper , `` electron discharge with the stereochronous transistor `` , which he presented to the american physical society in 1930 . the paper , with colleagues j . b . a. randall and r. e. shackelford , anticipated later work by researchers such as robert stoup and ernest lindemann , establishing that the magnetic momenta of a semiconductor could be measured using time and distance variations of the electron path .
the early contributions of aubrey e. bala laid the groundwork for widely adopted cross-band magnetic momenta measurements , and a new field of research—electronic spectroscopy .


=== nobel prize in physics ===

the university of california awarded bala the nobel prize in physics in 1962 for the discovery of the wicker equation , which described the magnetisation of semiconductor surfaces by magnetic moments . the nobel laureate wrote , `` if you read the paper on its own , you will not find anything resembling a name . but remember , in the long term , it will have great significance to particle physics. `` the nobel prize was first presented on may 27 , 1964 , by nobel laureate arno penzias .

sir james laycock ( 13 march 1809 – 18 march 1892 ) was a british politician , civil servant and biographer who served as the house of commons speaker between 1877 and 1882 .


== biography ==
laycock was born in st john 's hall , london , to john laycock , an industrialist who became mayor of bath , and his wife , mary haydon , daughter of john haydon and sir james minnie . his father , sir j. laycock , was in the course of advocating the establishment of schools , and in 1839 , having secured from bishop ferdinand day his support for that purpose , laid the foundation of a new independent cathedral school , a gift from the first lord of st john . laycock was educated at the cornhill school , basingstoke , and at the royal military college , woolwich.he joined the conservatives , but not until 1864 was elected a fellow of the royal society of london , and was so influential that lord rennard became aware of the sudden change of his position . at a private dinner in 1867 he co-sponsored an article entitled `` the government 's war `` , of which , as a member , he was also a member of the royal society . in 1869 he was elected a fellow of the royal statistical society and of the economic association of great britain . he then served as a government advisor until 1881 , when he was forced out of office by the changes of 1881 . the year of the sheep was his last official act .


== social views ==
laycock , along with his successor lord richards , was in favour of introducing a constitution that would extend the franchise to its essential features , without restricting it to male suffrage and education ; and a government or a parliament should be free to legislate as to civil , ecclesiastical and commercial matters . on the other hand , he was a `` socialist `` , and in 1864 , as successor to lord lusby , he wrote the motion of the house of lords which made it compulsory for the house of commons to investigate issues relating to industrial production , a duty which was to be a privilege of parliament .


== politics ==
laycock was for the reconstruction of the post-war parliament after the civil war . he regarded it as incumbent on him to introduce reforms in the war effort and to urge them in parliament . he was at first enthusiastic about making improvements in the relations between the army and the navy , but at a conference of his conservative colleagues , he sharply criticised them for their utter indifference to the services that the navy rendered to britain , and particularly the navy 's great contribution to the strength and capability of the air fleet . nevertheless , his intervention in 1881 marked the end of his career .

hugo grotz ( german : [ hɛɛ ] ; 9 march 1891 – 24 november 1975 ) was a german-born american violinist and composer . he is most notable for the composition of the opera gipsy danger in tenor and piano .


== biography ==
hugo grotz was born on 9 march 1891 in munich to anton grotz , a retired baritone of the teutonic order , and sophie czemka . he studied violin at the leipzig conservatory and at the berlin-based max vogel conservatory where his father , also a violinist , worked under paul hindemith .
in 1909 , grotz was commissioned by the russian empire as a violinist for the hetalia opera in saint petersburg . he was the master cellist for the inaugural opera . he performed that premiere in a modified version of the hungarian folk song style which was first performed in istanbul in 1913 . the opera was one of the first successes of g. usserviz . as a violinist , grotz composed and performed his own scores , especially the multi-movement gipsy danger ( 1927 ) , performed at the 1936 world 's fair in washington , dc . the score was originally composed for two pianos , but grotz had to substitute these two instruments for the two traditional concert-game pianos to accommodate an increased audience size . his version of gipsy danger had some parallels with that of chopin and liszt , but was also distinctly unique in how he developed the music to the choral techniques of mazurkas , polka and rachmaninoff . it is significant that grotz was instrumental in writing the text for this work , which was written by hermann heyde and ernst gerhard herzog and premiered by wilhelm stein ( conductor of the bach and rachmaninoff hall orchestra , 1910–11 ) .
in 1927 , grotz joined the prague philharmonic orchestra ( now known as the kreisau circle ) , a highly trained professional orchestra which also included liszt , chopin , schumann , and debussy . from 1927 to 1933 grotz was a professor at the juilliard school , but he never returned to teaching there . grotz retired from the prague philharmonic in 1934 . he married rebecca cohn ( 1889–1990 ) in 1933 and they had three children , hector ( who would go on to become a noted classical pianist ) , hanna , and patricia ( born 1955 ) .in the late 1940s , grotz turned to violin-making as a career and joined the offenbach-la mer for the large-scale work nacht der fliegende ( 1936 ) . in the late 1950s and 1960s , he also composed works for organ and chamber music . among his larger-scale works was the opera circus bleu ( 1960 ) in which he played an unnamed character in the role of the inimitable madame bovary . from 1955 , grotz also appeared on many radio programs promoting the work of josef kosminsky and other great austrian composers .
grotz served as a viola soloist in the cantata les musketeers du bassin et la guerre ( 1950 ) and the orchestral pieces andante for piano ( 1961 ) and le musique ( 1962 ) . he also composed cello sonatas ( string quartet ) , which were largely for the bbc symphony orchestra , and conducted schubert and liszt recitals . his choirsman has been noted as having a particular talent for arranging the minuets of mozart . a book was published in 1968 called lo professeur grotz : his art of strings which details his day to day practice of orchestral playing . in 1971 he retired from the violin making profession . he also continued to write as a composer and was a staff member for the minnesota orchestra .
grotz died in minneapolis on 24 november 1975 at age 83 .

gustaf björnram claimed to be able to communicate with the spirits of the dead and arranged well-attended séances frequented by the king and prince charles , during which he allegedly forwarded predictions about the future from the dead . for a couple of years around 1780 , he was an immensely fashionable medium in stockholm , was inducted into the freemasons and given a sinecure by the monarch . he once performed a séance in the church of lovö , where he called upon the spirit of adolf frederick , king of sweden in the presence of the king and a circle of his favorites , among them adolf fredrik munck , where the father of the king appeared as a mask behind a curtain of smoke in the dark church .
however , when his prediction about the death of the king 's mother , which was eagerly awaited by the king , did not materialize , and the royal physician sven anders hedin exposed him as a fraud by describing how he had witnessed his preparations for the so-called seance in the lovö church , he lost his favor with the king , who gave him a pension and dismissed him from court . he was replaced by henrik gustaf ulfvenklou .

ælle harlandhund ( november 12 , 1897 – october 12 , 1974 ) was a danish geneticist and bacteriologist . in particular , he is known for his studies of the roots of typhus in both humans and nonhuman animals . harlandhund is regarded as the father of modern research in the study of typhus .


== early life ==
harlandhund was born in copenhagen in 1897 . in 1903 he began his studies at the university of copenhagen at a time when textbooks concerning bacteriology were scarce . at the age of 23 , he became the leader of a group of scientists who made a number of discoveries that were incorporated into the emerging field of microbiology in copenhagen .
his research included the establishment of a typhoid susceptibility test on a castrated patient , discovering the origin of syphilis in mice , and the production of a type of rifless virus for test-producing mosquitoes . later , he worked on breeding typhus virus in a carrier form into a rickettsial ( or virulence-forming ) vector organism . he produced and showed that the paralytic form , typhus typhimurium , had a much shorter life span than the live form . he also wrote a paper on the development of typhoid vaccines in 1917 and many other papers and textbooks on bacteriology .


== career ==
at the turn of the 20th century , typhus fever had become a leading cause of death in the british isles , and an epidemic epidemic was rampant . harlandhund 's early work led him to the opinion that the malarial and sclerotinoid-tolerant mosquito probably produced its infection via the bite of an infected mosquito . although he subsequently supported an association of the bite of a malay asian mosquito with typhus , his own research of disease transmission suggests the possibility that the disease arises from contact with a host 's blood cells from another species . his research of the plasmodium parasites from what he called `` mothers `` , proved important in elucidating the source of the disease , and found that women from asia , predominantly china , brought the disease with them to denmark .
he is most notable for his work in typhus that has been dedicated to the discovery of a vaccine that is less likely to cause disease to infected humans . his research was instrumental in the development of vaccine treatments for typhus a , in which anti-siphon life-suppresses agents and antisera for typhus .
he has also worked to confirm the identity of the human form of streptococcus mutans for a strain of streptococcal bacteria .
the medical name for this bacterium , edemyscus mutans , in the genus bubo , is named after him .


== honors and awards ==
harlandhund was a commander of the order of the dannebrog ( bd ) . he received many honors , including the carl emden medal , the golden jubilee medal of the royal danish society of medicine , and the order of the dannebrog .

of the german jewish family of gompertz of emmerich , he was born in london , where his father and grandfather had been successful diamond merchants . debarred , as a jew , from a university education , he studied on his own from an early age , in the writings of isaac newton , colin maclaurin , and william emerson . from 1798 he was a prominent contributor to the gentleman 's mathematical companion , and for a period won the annual prizes in the magazine for the solutions of problems.in line with his father 's wishes , he entered the london stock exchange . he became a member of the mathematical society of spitalfields , and served as its president when it was merged with the astronomical society of london . in 1819 he was elected a f.r.s . , and in 1832 became a member of the council . the astronomical society was founded in 1820 , and he was elected a member of the council in 1821.on the death of his only son he retired from the stock exchange , and absorbed himself in mathematics . when the guardian insurance office was established in 1821 , he was a candidate for the actuaryship , but the directors objected to him on the grounds that he was a jew . his brother-in-law sir moses montefiore with his relative nathan mayer rothschild then founded the alliance assurance company ( 1824 ) , and gompertz was appointed actuary under the deed of settlement . his management of the alliance company was successful , he was consulted by government , and made computations for the army medical board.in 1848 he retired from active work and returned to his scientific labours . he was a member of many learned societies , and was also one of the promoters of the society for the diffusion of useful knowledge . of the leading jewish charities he was a prominent member , and he worked out a plan of poor relief ( jewish chronicle , 6 october 1845 ) , which was afterwards adopted by the jewish board of guardians.gompertz died from a paralytic seizure on 14 july 1865 .


== works ==

mathematicsfrom 1806 he was a frequent contributor to the philosophical transactions of the royal society ; but his early tracts on complex numbers and porisms ( 1817–18 ) were self-published . gompertz was an old-fashioned newtonian who retained and defended the notation of fluxions .
astronomyfor ten years he actively participated in the work of the astronomical society , contributing papers on the theory of astronomical instruments , the aberration of light , the differential sextant , and the convertible pendulum . with francis baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars ; the work was left uncompleted , because of the publication of the fundamenta astronomiæ of friedrich bessel . their efforts , however , led to the complete catalogue of stars of the royal astronomical society .
the gompertz modelhe worked out a new series of tables of mortality for the royal society , and these suggested to him in 1825 his law of human mortality , which he first expounded in a letter to francis baily . the law rests on an a priori assumption that a person 's resistance to death decreases as his years increase . the model can be written in this way :

when he went to algeria in 1945 , he sent a message to erhard stumpf , german foreign minister , that he was going to liberate algeria from islam , and the french were of the opinion that germany should get involved in the region . fraenkel wanted france to take over the energy trade with algeria , with the power to set the terms for the extraction of oil . after negotiations with the french , albert speer , then-vice-chancellor of germany , told fraenkel to get out of algeria . however , fraenkel also warned stumpf that if france was not compelled , the soviet union would succeed in liberating algeria . fraenkel instructed stumpf that he was from russia and that he could not negotiate with him.fraenkel remained in algeria after the war was over , and was asked to help in reforming the french economy . in 1952 , fraenkel went to moscow , where he was invited to become a director of siboga communications , a russian company . in this position he was concerned with establishing a national radio system with the cooperation of the local telephone and telegraph companies , while also working on the soviet-controlled communications experiment station ( cpsu ) . fraenkel resigned in 1954 , and was replaced by hermann seligman . he returned to germany in 1956 and remained in this post until he died in 1963 .
fraenkel is known for his service in the german air force , as well as in military and technical matters . fraenkel specialized in navigation and aeronautical equipment , and was a major in the german v-2 development program during the war . he established the air-speed research laboratory at bielefeld to develop airplanes and jets , and built the do 26 jet , the world 's first supersonic jet powered by a liquid-fuel engine , which flew during the final test flight in 1959 , just before the end of the war . he used the british vega , a supersonic bomber , to perform blind aeronautical tests , with the plan of combining the twin-engined vega with a more efficient turboprop aircraft to provide the ultimate supersonic machine . in his spare time he was also interested in biological research . he wrote a work on `` the air element in babies `` , and held an interest in the defence industry .

= `` george christy `` =
george christy ( june 19 , 1887 - june 10 , 1942 ) was a british physicist , pioneer of dynamical fluid mechanics , and co-discoverer of ferromagnetism .
christy first took a course in mathematics at balliol college , cambridge in 1895 . by 1901 , he had graduated with an m.sc . in physical chemistry from the university of edinburgh . in 1903 , he joined the royal college of science as a physics lecturer and later became its head of the chemistry department . in 1907 , he won the royal society 's turing medal , awarded by lord kelvin , for demonstrating that materials flow in a closed loop .
by 1916 , he was dean of the engineering faculty at the university of london . in that year , he coined the term `` monoclinic contraflow `` to describe how a moving fluid smoothly flows between two points on the surface of a globe , which is necessary to accurately describe what a fluid could have been . this same principle , that particles flow in straight lines , is usually known as `` monoclinic contraflow `` . christy 's and kelvin 's lines'shared the same intuitive quality ; as moore states , `` it was his idea that conic section had to be displayed in triangles and planar triangles. `` it also would be an error , moore clarifies , to think that these curves were `` certainly 'infinite'lines , and that 'flat'points'could not be anything but points ' , whereas the flow of fluids within liquids , with the necessary 'order ' ( or , in other words , if the lines went in circles , they had to have precisely defined lines ) . ``
in 1927 , he designed the first self-contained dynamical fluid laboratory , which was based on the model of a vacuum tube that supplied an inner tube containing three lids for the magnets , a fourth tube filled with solvent , and a vacuum that the upper secondary for each metal flowed into . using the monoclinic contraflow principle , it was possible to determine the velocity at which the solvents flowed into the first tube and continue to the second , and the third , and so on , adding up the flow speed . the resulting flow data could then be used to model flow in the rest of the machine , or to probe the wavefunctions that distinguish slow-acting liquid from more rapid-acting .
christy is also well known for another discovery : the mineral potassium ores . in 1925 , christy 's son , richard christy , a professor of biochemistry , began studying chemical isotopes of potassium , of which he found an isotope whose ratio to beryllium was positive and positive-to-negative . he went on to obtain isotope ratios to two to three standard deviations higher than those expected from the age of the earth . when his son 's work was published in 1929 , christy noted that he had `` solved the problem without naming a new element , though he made some research in a few scientific papers which , it is said , are amusing nonsense `` . a century later , barry zinn claimed in the second edition of his book metaphysics and cosmology that

... stephen g. christy , in his article on ten years ago ( published in `` science `` ) wrote of chemistry that the lines of a liquid that has a density greater than the energy given by ‘ potassium fluoride ’ ( that is , higher than 250 mev per gram of salt ) flow slower than the lines of a liquid whose surface area is only twice that . on this reading , his assertion that the lines of the sodium fluoride , which are thought to be too heavy to flow at all , are carried by conical streams could hardly be more disregarded ; there is an element of chemistry , however well-known , which is within reach of mankind , namely the hydraulic operation of cooling salt of various degrees of hardness in chambers , for cooling the atmospheres of coal , gold , and silver mines , where the boiling and cooling of superfluid gases are of great importance .
the first reference to `` pure metal `` was made by christy in 1910 , but it took about 40 years for other authors to provide these original proofs of his .

== career ==
in 1784 , hodge became professor of physics at the royal college of surgeons in london . in 1797 he was made an examiner in physics , and had a small practical base there for a period of time , when a summer trip to paris interrupted this . in 1799 he made the acquaintance of henry miley ( 1726–1815 ) , whom he subsequently married in 1799 . the two men had a very close relationship and this allowed hodge to research briefly in chemistry and magnetism .

hodge applied his theoretical chemistry to physics and set up a laboratory in st. john 's chapel , one of the first buildings of its kind in the country.he was , in connection with the preparation of the principles of chemistry , one of the editors of the philosophical transactions of the royal society in 1817 . his publication included an exhaustive analysis of the ordinary vibrations of acids , the electricity and magnetism in those chemicals , and of the properties of metals.this was followed in 1813 by a treatise on magnetism ( also known as the magnetism of carbonic acid , metals , and transistors ) , where he proposed the world 's first magnetisation principle . in 1818 , having also studied glass , he set up his own business , selling the production of glass to glass manufacturers . he married the daughter of the rev . george howard ( 1781–1840 ) , the first non-royal to hold this post in the church of england , on 3 april 1822 . after his retirement from his clerical career , hodge assumed the periodical duties of editor , in 1825 to 1829 . on his death the magazine published a continuation of his work under the title of materia medica magna ( 1828–1837 ) , which succeeded in perpetuating his prestige in chemistry . he also co-edited with wren , physica chemistry . in 1836 , john tennant , london , publisher of those papers , offered him an appointment as editor and declared him `` one of the greatest modern students and practitioners of the more general science of physics `` .in 1839 he became acting examiner for science and for three years was president of the royal institution of the royal society , the first non-royal to hold the post . he was one of the founders of the royal academy of arts and letters , holding the chair until 1846 . in 1849 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and in 1851 its president .

chandler was an author and historian who lectured on history , economics , and religion , especially about moses . chandler 's most successful book in terms of recognition by scholars is four thousand years of urban growth ( 1987 ) . the book includes estimates of the population of cities since ancient times . although the book has been widely quoted , urban historians have criticized chandler 's superficial and uncritical use of sources , leading to unreliable population estimates for many past cities .


== claims ==
outside of his mainstream work on populations of ancient cities , chandler held many alternative ideas on history which he discussed in his book godly kings and early ethics where he presented his ideas on moses and his belief that zeus and other figures in greek mythology were actual people . he developed these claims in some of his other books as well , some of his claims included :

that zeus was a king in moses ' time .
that tubal of ancient spain may have built stonehenge .
that moses was ikhnaton 's vizier ramose .
that chinese writing was derived from that of moses .
that hindu reincarnation concepts came from egypt .

in 1889 focke conducted an inquiry into the former occurrence of malaria in northern germany . he also did much of the work throughout his life on the taxonomy of rubus ( rosaceae ) and published several studies ( 1877-1914 ) . he wrote a number of section monographs for adolf engler and karl anton eugen prantl eds . die natürlichen pflanzenfamilien in the family rosaceae , notably regarding fruit-bearing plants of that family .
much of his other output was published in the bremen periodical : abhandlungen : naturwissenschaftlicher verein zu bremen , a complete list of the published papers in this periodical is available . on examining the focke entries on this list of articles , one can appreciate the wide range of subjects that he studied as well as the industry with which he applied himself to his work .

henry west frs ( 10 october 1882 – 26 november 1942 ) was an english physician and plant pathologist who was famous for isolating the rare parasitic fenugreek disease haemophilus pneumoniae . his publications in nature influenced the discovery of the immune reaction to the organism .


== biography ==
west was born in southampton and educated at southampton grammar school , then the earl 's school in gloucester . after earning his md from st mary 's hospital in 1899 , he practised in a small practising school in westgate for the rest of his life .
in 1903 he joined the imperial college of tropical medicine and hygiene where , shortly before the outbreak of the first world war , he worked with the interwar plague experts . in october 1917 he joined the royal army medical corps as a botanicalist , before moving to the cavendish laboratory where he worked on producing anthrax and for many years discovered many new pathogenic fungi . west gave up professional duties to concentrate on scientific research in 1918 , undertaking the first scientific assessment of the nature of the plague in england . in 1927 he introduced the isolation of a dangerous black widow 's disease pathogen , haemophilus pneumoniae , in wales , as a cure . his results suggested that the disease was spread through contact with the blood and muscle of a healthy infected victim , a conclusion later confirmed by both james radcliffe , the british army 's chief of bacteriology , and henry draper , founder of the american bacteriological department . it was noted by those involved in the investigation that west had been particularly favourable to radcliffe and draper , and in particular to draper for his help . although the legion of merit award was granted to west for his services , the outbreak of the first world war proved the real reason for his retirement from the royal army medical corps . his insistence on imposing high standards on medical work and in particular on blood research was demonstrated by his influence on a number of top scientists in britain , including richard lewis thompson ( one of the first american microbiologists ) , gino bailli , john mackintosh , and w. hewitt stearns .
west died on 26 november 1942 from pneumonia following a brief illness . his research on the plague spread the same way he had promised : through leaflets placed in the homes of infected families . the women were urged to draw the blood of sick and convalescent persons in order to collect any blood in the family 's home , leaving it with a host of parasites that could then be taken home to cause the disease . a common misconception in the eyes of some had been the theory that body contact with the blood of healthy people ensured a cure , but west was clear in his identification and diagnosis : it was the process of incubation and contact between the patient and blood that developed the fever and caused the clinical symptoms . west showed that a host of blood-borne protozoa could transfer pathogenic in the blood of an infertile person , and he immediately alerted world health organisation authorities .


== scientific contributions ==
west conducted much of his research and clinical work in england with the legionnaires'disease research unit in colchester , assisted by albert costas after he became director of the unit . west is known for the public relations campaign of laying hard and fast foundations and turning out campaigners such as william horner and terence maugham for the outbreak in rotherham ; this was almost entirely to provide support to children , both from the rotherham association ( the local school ) and adults in rotherham , and the environment .

campegius vitringa sr. , or kempe vitringa ( born at leeuwarden , may 16 , 1659 ; died at franeker , march 31 , 1722 ) was a dutch protestant theologian and hebraist . his youngest of four children was campeius vitringa ( 1693-1723 ) .
vitringa , a follower of johannes cocceius , was a supporter of prophetic theology . he was educated at the universities of franeker and leiden , and became professor of oriental languages at the former in 1681 . when locating prophetic outcomes , he would associate events to the near rather than the far-off future , placing a distinct focus on the period of the maccabees ( 2nd century bc ) . like joseph mede ( 1586-1638 ) , vitringa believed wholeheartedly that the millennium was yet to come , but did not expect any immediate changes . he relegated the end of the time to a remote future and strongly emphasized the concept of new jerusalem . his most important student is considered herman venema ( 1697-1787 ) , who was a theology professor at franeker.vitringa ’ s two chief works are his dissertation on the synagogue , de synagoga vetere libri tres ( franeker , 1685 ; 2d ed . 1696 ) ; and his commentary on isaiah ( leeuwarden , 1714–20 ) , which was frequently republished in the eighteenth century . the latter was up to the time of gesenius the most considerable contribution to the exegesis of isaiah . his other works include , sacrarum observationum libri sex ( franeker , 1683-1708 ) and anacrisis apocalypseos joannis apostoli ( 1705 ) .


== anacrisis apocalypseos ==

vitringa ’ s most notable work was anacrisis apocalypseos joannis apostoli ( 1705 ) , which was considered a major event , in the history of prophetic theology at the turn of the 18th century . he drew extensively on the clavis apocalyptica ( 1627 ) , by joseph mede ( 1586-1638 ) . vitringa ’ s work was regarded the first major study to analyze the book of revelation as a structured chronological outline of the history of the christian church . his interpretation of the apocalypse was that of a coded description of the history of the new testament church . though vitringa had integrated the historical method of hugo grotius in past work , he rejected the view of grotius and bossuet that associated john ’ s visions exclusively to early christendom .

wilhelm ludwig norendorf ( german : [ ˈweːl̡nɔ̯ fʁilɛ ] ; 10 november 1847 – 9 april 1931 ) was a german scientist and a researcher at the technical university of berlin .


== biography ==
he graduated from the leipzig gymnasium in 1876 , received his doctorate there in 1882 , and from 1884 to 1890 was professor of physical chemistry . from 1890 to 1901 he served as chair of physical chemistry at the technical university of berlin . in 1902 , he founded the `` linnéstleftey `` , a laboratory for physical chemistry , in the laboratories of the university , before moving to the technische hochschule berlin .
from 1902 to 1905 he was director of the institute for physical chemistry and the chemical institute of the technical university of berlin . norendorf worked under leo kornmesser , the eminent physicist who had gone on to become head of the german academy of sciences in 1924 .
he was at first critical of jewish students , and although his contributions in chemical research were generally received with great enthusiasm he ultimately found that the emigration of `` jewish savages `` was leading to increasing ecological deterioration . following a series of conferences and public lectures , norendorf went into exile from germany in 1904 and returned to the technical university of berlin , where he remained until his death in 1931 .
he was the author of a collection of scientific papers on zoological subjects , theological view of botany and animal diseases ( 1910 ) , which made him renowned among the scientific community . he was a member of the societatis scientiarum dei dei .
norendorf made important contributions to chemical analysis , and he introduced nmr spectroscopy into experimental biology . in 1907 , after more than thirty years in berlin , norendorf accepted a chair in the rensch-eberstelle deutschen physiologie at the technical university of berlin , which he held until 1919 .


== achievements ==
norendorf was responsible for the founding of the laboratory for physical chemistry at the technische hochschule , and with hans lohmann , he created the basis of nmr spectroscopy , which he subsequently published . he was also the co-author of the manuscript on teratology which appeared in the first edition of volume 4 of the german scientific journal , the journal of experimental biology .


=== norendorf ’ s principle of predictive death ===
norendorf 's idea on predictive death was that the disease experienced in a particular patient will sometimes be followed by a decrease in the subsequent prognosis .
norendorf suggested the hypothesis that any change in prognosis indicates a sufficient progressive deterioration in the prognosis . in 1899 , he reported that the `` precisely ” tumor following lung cancer was more likely to have progressed to latent infection when patients were given a “ course of an antibiotic ” , and that to make a prognosis accurate , he required a patient to die before dying of some other cancer , or complications.for a considerable period of time after norendorf ’ s death , in germany , in the late twentieth century , there were efforts to establish a new nomenclature for diseases with predictable prognoses .
the cause of regression is the reason for a previous diagnosis .
pain caused by arthritis has been called an `` asterisk ich nachthen ” ( asterisk principle ) .

= john baines ( humourist ) =
john baines ( 2 june 1844 – 7 september 1908 ) was a british humourist and broadcaster . he worked as editor of one of the earliest early newspapers on german military and naval affairs . he then made an important contribution to the history of satire , from the 1850s to the late 19th century , writing some 200 essays and non-fiction books .
he was born in burney , surrey , the son of j.b. baines ( 1818–1902 ) and mary pinchbeck ( 1840–1903 ) . his older brother , the satirist james baines , was also a novelist , having created a study of crime in the 1850s , and edited the popular memoirs of the 1857 columbian exposition .


== education and career ==
baines studied at eton college in 1881 , and was then awarded a scholarship to study at christ church , oxford . this provided him with an extensive background in germanic culture , and served him well in his career as a historian and comedy writer . as a native of the north of england , he had a long habit of preferring the more civilized education of the educated classes and was talented at the art of creating mockable characters and supplying them with material . with such ease , baines at the age of twenty-two formed the primary plot-point of many of his earlier stories , and perhaps also adapted the gallant protestant , cornish-scottish knight from the two towers , despite his scottish heritage . however , after a period as an unpaid lecturer , when others were leaving the uk to take post-graduate positions in germany , he ultimately abandoned study and moved on to active ministry .


=== glimpses of the italian world ===
baines followed this with a series of books published in 1901 and 1902 , exploring a wide range of topics in the history of italian war and naval affairs . in 1902 , baines was admitted a fellow of the royal society and in 1914 the order of the british empire . in a long letter to his friend , the poet herbert findlay ( 1850-1913 ) , he expresses disgust with the treatment of napoleon 's position in italy , as well as his strategic misdeeds . these both point towards the influence that glee in general and humour in particular can have on history , as well as his recommendation for baines not to consider joining the british army .
in later years , baines made occasional appearances as a guest commentator on history , even appearing on the radio , and wrote several autobiographical and memoirs . in 1902 , he invited another old friend , the playwright c. r. lodge , to sing the march of gallipoli to a surviving recruits of the enemy . while he was singing , nine soldiers were blinded by a fireworks display . baines later recalled the experience of watching three men blinded by a sapling blast to the head ; their shocked appearance was the result of hearing so much noise that they thought it was a rifle shot , and , witnessing the amputation of three fingers and the flash of exploding shells , regarded it as `` the greatest feat of human comedy `` he had witnessed .


=== the oldest individualist society and gilbert russell ===
another of baines'works of historical comedy was the creation of an extended satirical system of english county names , setting forth the seeds of the ideas in the early comedy of the oldest individualist society . published posthumously in 1915 , this book has been criticised for containing predictable gags , although many of these were based on original material , and for avoiding in favour of greater historical accuracy .


== later life and death ==
baines died in st peter 's , woolwich , london , and was buried in his ancestral catterick home , at the lambeth cemetery in borough market .

methodios fouyias ( greek : μεθόδιος φούγιας ; 12 september 1924 in corinth – 7 july 2006 ) served as greek orthodox archbishop of thyateira and great britain ( concomitantly apokrisiarios of the ecumenical patriarch to the archbishop of canterbury ) from 1979 to 1988 . after studies in the theological faculty of the university of athens and parochial responsibilities in munich , he served in various positions within the patriarchate of alexandria culminating in that of metropolitan of axum covering ethiopia and the horn of africa . fouiyas ' studies and encounters led to a favourable understanding of the church of england which he saw in some respects as a continuator of the saxon church before the norman conquest , the gregorian reform and most importantly the east–west schism of 1054 . he was thus seen as the ideal candidate for the post of archbishop in london . several years experience however of deepening division within anglicanism led him openly to suggest ( in an article in the times ) that the road to unity for anglicans lay in submission to the discipline of the roman catholic church . as his post involved close relations with lambeth it was judged expedient that he should be recalled . methodios assumed the title of pisidia and continued his studies ( notably on bessarion ) in greece .

= anton de vries =
anton de vries , also spelled de vries , ( 2 april 1731 – 8 august 1816 ) was a dutch geographer .
his father , jacob de vries , was a writer of encyclopaedia britannica , and whose library was included in the hall of the dutch academy of arts and sciences in amsterdam . his mother , anna caroline , a bookseller and antiquarian , was a well-known dutch traveller in the dutch east indies , and probably a native of amsterdam .
in 1794 , during the dutch reformation , anton de vries became a catholic ; the reformation was coming to an end in holland , and he became a reformed calvinist , and kept close to it throughout his life . de vries'own opinion on the reformation was positive : he expressed his belief that the reformation was unnecessary , and the protestants true members of the church . thus he believed that all the doctrines of jesus christ were truths which were to be found in christianity . he defended the legitimacy of the reformed churches and their institutions . de vries took special care that his view should never be misunderstood or misunderstood ; this is evident by his attitude to protestant missions in holland and in england . he also tried to establish peace between the protestants and the catholic church ; when english travellers went to dutch holland to learn about the reformation , he was , no doubt , very pleased to make arrangements for their stay in dutch towns , so that they might return home later to hear the protestant preacher preach and judge for themselves whether he was right . one of his best-known sermons was delivered at amsterdam in 1777 , upon the day of the plague . this speech was published in a pamphlet at his request in 1775 . he also took part in the suppression of the congregational church at amsterdam ; this took place at the instigation of johan van der lubbe .
de vries was probably one of the three men who , in september 1651 , surveyed the western coast of canada , perhaps the most important of any geographical survey to make a thorough sketch of the country 's terrain , geography and climate .
among the works cited in de vries 's pamphlet the geography of the world by his enquiry into the movements and accomplishments of the engravers and weavers is `` which furthers to further the antiquities of man , and their revealing ways , with full reference to the orientals and modes of relation. ``

horace drake frs ( september 21 , 1922 – september 5 , 2004 ) was a british–american geneticist .


== biography ==
horace drake graduated with a degree in mathematics from leeds university , earning his phd on the `` coenzyme-3 enzyme and its mrna `` from harvard university in 1955 . his phd students included john a. lawson , dr. robert meltzer , dr. roland c. hyatt , dr. brian david levy , e. robert jackson , and george albert hauser .
in 1956 he obtained a doctorate in biochemistry from the university of texas at austin . in 1959 he joined the cornell university school of medicine and earned his m.d . in 1960 with a thesis , the role of genes in the significance of differences in drug delivery to and population dynamics .
in the mid-1960s drake went to work at the rockefeller institute for medical research on hereditary diseases and genetics in the birth defects and cancer research laboratories .
he made major contributions in the area of common diseases and genetic variants : from studying the linkage of congenital diabetes to presenilin-t and in detecting signatures of mutations associated with lethal syphilis in pregnancies , he learned about recessive types of sickle cell disease and from 1958 , he became an early expert on altered patterns of chromosome imprinting in diseases such as duchenne muscular dystrophy and alveolar and colic .
the major breakthrough , however , came in 1964 when he and henry d. cowan showed that mutations in a gene known as g protein-coupled receptor ( gpr41 ) functioned as a lifelong alternate control for a genetic disorder caused by the overexpression of the defective gene . more significantly , it was here that drake proposed an explanation for genetic imprinting in inheritance ( disease ) and explained the essential role of regulation of the g protein-coupled receptor in regulatory systems ( pathological changes ) , such as the control of protein secretion and protein kinetics ( how cells and tissues send and receive nutrients and nutrients'metabolic energy ) . he and cowan thus created the model of a genetic predisposition ( in their terminology , disease ) and discovered a way to genetically segregate variants of this particular gene . together , they founded , in 1967 , the genetic epidemiology group ( geg ) and made a foundational contribution to the use of gene-environment interaction models in genetic epidemiology .
drake remained at cornell university until retiring in 1982 . in 1988 he and his wife , margaret , bought a home in duluth , minnesota .
he remained on the faculty of the university of minnesota .
drake was honored with the adolphe and marion guérin family foundation for his leadership in both advancing genetics and in fostering biomedical research .

robert c. nichols ( 14 january 1915 – 7 january 2006 ) was an american econometrician and chairman of the economics department at george washington university , where he held the position of economics professor for 15 years.he was born in bridgewater , new jersey , to parents john john nichols and elmer primm nichols . he earned his ba from the university of pennsylvania in 1938 and his phd in 1946 from the university of michigan with a thesis entitled `` bipartisan finance `` . his first paid academic appointment was as assistant chief of staff at the department of commerce in washington dc , where he also served as the director of the regional economic research center . while at the commerce department , he also became a founding member of the economic research service ( ers ) , and served as its chief economist from 1964 to 1966 . he then returned to the university of michigan as its director of the institute for work study from 1968 to 1969 , and from 1970 to 1971 , as its associate director .


== career ==
as part of his work on economic cycle theory , he advocated the economic imperative model , which would predict the best course of action for a host of economic actors when faced with a political choice that included certain policies , especially that of the republican presidential nominee ronald reagan . nichols helped refine the doctrine of a cost function ( finding that if the constraints of current economic policy are not great enough , any policy that raises costs can have a marginal increase in output and employment ) and created a novel rule for comparing labor costs with current levels of unemployment in the absence of a growth in available labor markets , as well as an economic equilibrium model , based on the premise that only low wage workers are ever required to accept unemployment benefits.his most significant contributions to macroeconomics came during his tenure at the university of michigan , starting in 1969 . after completing his phd work with colleague e. p. putnam , nichols began work at george washington university as a full professor in 1970 . with george washington university 's industrial development policy program , nichols developed the economic component to the key achievement of the national research council , a new economic development ( ned ) program that set objectives for national economic growth in terms of development and the capacity to improve living standards . nichols'work was the driving force behind the ned and is considered to be the foundation for many subsequent ned programs .
in 1971 , nichols retired as director of the institute for work study , and began the creation of a second-year department of economics endowed chair at the university . nichols'tenure at the university of michigan was historically one of expansion rather than retrenchment , and continued the long-term renewal of the new faculty of economics . during his tenure at the university , nichols championed research by alex m. reichelt and jacques roux , and wrote popular works on macroeconomics for students . in 1999 , nichols retired as a professor at george washington university , and received a government retirement pension of $ 300,000 for 10 years .
in 2005 , nichols was named the 21st president of the international association for the advancement of economic studies .

bucquet was born in paris , in 1746 . he was first sent to study law but he then turned to science and attended classes at the faculty of medicine in paris . there he encountered for the first time chemistry applied to medicine . despite financial trouble , he graduated in 1770 and thus became docteur-régent , and married marie claude leredde shortly after . he then started teaching a public course in chemistry in his own laboratory . between 1771 and 1773 , bucquet published a manual of chemistry , first on mineral then on vegetal chemistry , destined for the use of beginners in the science who need a coherent overview of the different processes and products in use . this manual was intended for people attending his course but also for those who could not . bucquet 's public course carried out for several years , and was mentioned in the journal de médecine . in 1775 , bucquet became professor of pharmacy at the faculty of medicine at the university of paris , and the next year , following the death of augustin roux , he took the chair of chemistry at the faculty . he became part of the french academy of sciences as a chemist in 1777 . during his years at the academy , he published a few works of chemical analysis , including one in collaboration with the duke of la rochefoucauld . he eventually acquired the laboratory in rue jacob which used to belong to the chemist rouelle and carried out his public courses there . he continued giving public courses until 1779 , at which point he became to ill to continue . he was known to be a very good teacher and many attended his courses . he died of his disease in 1780 .
his most famous pupil was antoine-françois fourcroy who later carried on bucquet 's work on natural history .


== collaboration with lavoisier ==
in 1777 , bucquet worked with antoine lavoisier at his residence of the arsenal , performed many fundamental experiments of chemistry , with the aim of checking if there results which were widely used in chemistry , could still be considered reliable . lavoisier had the financial means and necessary laboratory equipment to perform such a task and bucquet brought his many years of experience in public demonstration and laboratory expertise . together , they published 26 memoirs at the academy of sciences . which led to bucquet 's nomination as academician .

daubrée was born at metz , and educated at the école polytechnique in paris .
at the age of twenty he had qualified as a mining engineer , and in 1838 he was appointed to take charge of the mines in the bas-rhin ( alsace ) , and subsequently to be professor of mineralogy and geology at the faculty of sciences , strasbourg . in 1859 he became engineer in chief of mines , and in 1861 , upon the death of louis cordier , he was appointed professor of geology at the museum d'histoire naturelle in paris and was also elected member of the french academy of sciences . in the following year he became professor of mineralogy at the école des mines , and in 1872 director of that school . in 1878 daubrée was elected vice-president and in 1879 president of the french academy of sciences . in 1880 the geological society of london awarded to him the wollaston medal . in 1881 he was promoted to grand officer of the french legion of honour.his published researches date from 1841 , when the origin of certain tin minerals attracted his attention ; he subsequently discussed the formation of bog-iron ore , and worked out in detail the geology of the bas-rhin ( 1852 ) . from 1857 to 1861 , while engaged in engineering works connected with the springs of plombieres , he made a series of interesting observations on thermal waters and their influence on the roman masonry through which they made their exit . he was , however , especially distinguished for his long-continued and often dangerous experiments on the artificial production of minerals and rocks . he likewise discussed the permeability of rocks by water , and the effects of such infiltration in producing volcanic phenomena ; he dealt with the subject of metamorphism , with the deformations of the earth 's crust , with earthquakes , and with the composition and classification of meteorites.he was elected a fellow of the royal society of london in 1881 , a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1892 , and an honorary fellow of the royal society of edinburgh in 1895.he died in paris on 29 may 1896 .

= yurii shirokov =
yurii shirokov , ( широков , юрий михайлович 21.6.1921—5.7.1980 ) , writer , physicist , professor .
graduated from moscow state university ( moscow ) in 1948 . worked in the same university , then in the steklov mathematical institute ( moscow ) . he wrote more than 100 scientific papers

and several monographs , among which the textbook `` nuclear physics `` is particularly relevant .
.


== algebra of generalized functions ==
yu.shirokov had constructed the algebra of generalized functions . then it was applied to various systems
.


== classical and quantum mechanics ==
shirokov was , perhaps , not the first to mention that quantum mechanics has many classical limits . the planck constant




ℏ



{ \displaystyle ~\hbar ~ }
appears in many relations , and there are many options to keep some of parameters ( or even to vary them all ) as




ℏ
→
0



{ \displaystyle ~\hbar \rightarrow 0~ }
. the most known limiting cases of quantum mechanics are classical waves and newtonian mechanics . shirokov has systematised the construction of classical limits of quantum mechanics , see
.


== development of shirokov 's ideas ==
the most important ideas about the quantum mechanics and the theoretical physics in general formulated by
shirokov are not yet developed . in particular , the field theory in terms of wave packets ( i.e . , without divergent terms and without divergent series ) is not yet constructed .

johann ( or jean ) caspar bauhin ( 12 december 1541 – 26 october 1613 ) was a swiss botanist , born in basel . he was the son of physician jean bauhin and the brother of physician and botanist gaspard bauhin .
johann bauhin studied botany at tübingen under leonhart fuchs ( 1501–1566 ) . he then travelled with conrad gessner , after which he started a practice of medicine at basel , where he was elected professor of rhetoric in 1566 . four years later he was invited to become the physician to frederick i , duke of württemberg at montbéliard , in the franche-comté where he remained until his death . he devoted himself chiefly to botany . his great work , historia plantarum universalis , a compilation of all that was then known about botany , remained incomplete at his death , but was published at yverdon in 1650–1651 .
bauhin nurtured several botanic gardens and also collected plants during his travels . in 1591 , he published a list of plants named after saints called de plantis a divis sanctisve nomen habentibus .
johann bauhin died in montbéliard .
carl linnaeus named the genus bauhinia ( family caesalpiniaceae ) for the brothers johann and gaspard bauhin .

= filippo corra =
filippo corra ( 11 april 1892 – 29 june 1966 ) was an italian physicist . he discovered the corra effect , a force that acts upon semiconductor displays . this effect describes the photodiodes , the crystalline materials that conduct light . it is the first known photodiodemic structure . his daughter elena corra was also a physicist .


== early life and career ==
corra was born in milan . he was a university student at the university of bologna , where he studied mathematics and physics .
his interest in research began in 1897 when he attended lectures given by professor mio correa . in the same year , corra studied by contact with elektor george steinbeck in königsberg . corra came to the conclusion that early childhood education should be given to children who were involved with art , especially drawing .
in 1905 corra became an assistant in correa 's physics department , and he was among the first students to introduce the use of biometrical measurements as a basis for teaching mathematics and physics . with correa as head of the department , he led research that resulted in the measurement of the amplitude of electric discharges , through over the colliding contacts on ferromagnetic quartz crystals . in 1906 corra discovered the corra force , a counter-intuitive effect that clearly accounts for the corra effect and was the first to establish a direct relationship between the intensity of an electric current and the contact size of the crystal . also , in 1906 , corra showed that this force does not depend on the diameter of the crystal , nor on the strength of the contact with a surface . in addition , corra found the prototype image projector during this time , also called `` corra sheet `` , which remained in use for many years .
corra also contributed to the development of the metric system.corra worked in one of correa 's ph.d. departmental laboratories at the university of milan and as an assistant in leopoldina 's physics department . his early work was dedicated to optical quantum mechanics , which led him to the discovery of the corra effect and the maxwell–zirkel effect . in 1910 corra became an assistant professor in rome , italy , where he continued to take important direct part in student work and in world war i . he then moved to america where he taught mathematics and physics to employees at the universities of colorado and yale.at the institute for optics in bologna , corra identified the reactance of electrical resistances that acted upon plates of superconducting material . in 1916 he showed that a voltage drop in a superconductor provided a significant component of the corra effect . from 1918 until his death , corra worked in the metallurgical laboratory at the university of bologna , where he was one of the founders of the new department of physics and quantum mechanics . he also received an honorary doctorate in 1954 from the university of padova . his scientific achievements are known in multiple media . since 1937 , he has been an editor of a number of scientific journals .


== legacy ==
corra 's reputation is held with the name corra iron , and his important contributions in the physics of superconductivity are still relatively few and fundamental today . corra was well known in physics education and he was instrumental in recruiting and retaining young graduate students . his achievements are complemented by his legendary students . among them were physicist vittorio sagme . the bronze statue of corra in the university of bologna 's institute for optical materials in pisa and the academic streets of rome are named after him.he was active in scientific societies , and he was elected as president of the italian association for scientific research and the scientific committee on physics .

suppose some emissary of darkness had spied out our liberty and had arraigned iowa college before the public as a place where young people were taught the dangerous doctrine of evolution . it may be that at so early a date the young professors would have been sent adrift and the public would have been assured that iowa college was a place where only safe opinions were allowed ! that is a place where only imbeciles and hypocrites are educated .

sir jack hibbert ( 14 february 1932 – 23 august 2005 ) was a british statistician and director of the central statistical office ( cso ) of the united kingdom , 1985–1992 . he was made a kcb in 1990 .


== background ==
sir jack hibbert was born in huddersfield , yorkshire , on 14 february 1932 . he was educated at leeds grammar school and the london school of economics and was married with two sons and one daughter . he died on 23 august 2005 in weybridge , surrey .


== career ==
hibbert joined the exchequer and audit department in 1952 and then moved to the central statistical office in 1960 , where he worked on economics statistics . he was promoted to chief statistician in 1970 and to assistant director in 1977 . in 1981 , he spent a period on loan to the oecd and to eurostat as a consultant and then joined the department of trade and industry as a director of statistics . on 1 august 1985 , he was appointed director of the central statistical office in succession to sir john boreham . he retired in 1992 .


== central statistical office ==
when jack hibbert took over the cso , it had suffered four years of cutbacks following the 'rayner review ' of official statistics . shortly after this , the then chancellor of the exchequer , nigel lawson , and other conservative politicians claimed that misleading statistics were largely responsible for the government 's poor handling of the economy . the treasury and civil service select committee recommended ' a thorough review into the operation of various departments involved in the collection of national accounts statistics ' . the review , by stephen pickford , recommended that there should be just one organisation responsible for the collection and compilation of statistics for national accounts .
this meant moving the business statistics office and responsibility for data on imports and exports from the department of trade and industry , and responsibility for the retail prices index from the department of employment . the changes , in july 1989 , increased the cso from just under 170 staff to about 1,000 . this was probably the biggest shake-up of official statistics since the creation of the cso in 1941 . jack hibbert had the difficult job of creating this new organisation .

jensen was born in portland , oregon . his father owned a small soap factory and early schooling was poorly attended . he got into homeopathic medicine , graduating in 1922 . in 1927 , he left homeopathic medicine to go to columbia university . a research assistant there , bernice la salle , introduced him to genetics and vaccination . in 1924 , jensen joined the somerville institute in new york city , working with joan greer , in collaboration with scientist albert hoffman .
in 1935 , jensen and greer developed the peptide virus a . from 1947 to 1953 , he was the distinguished professor of genetics at columbia university .
after retirement , jensen continued to collaborate with other researchers and the bundestag in their efforts to develop polio vaccines , and was an early advocate for the laboratory-based treatment of children with polio . in 1955 , the institute he founded , which he called genetics laboratory of the american association for the advancement of science , was renamed the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases.in the late 1940s , after receiving a grant from the rockefeller foundation , he went to work at the rockefeller institute for medical research ( now the rockefeller university ) in new york city on the study of bacteria , viruses and other emerging infectious agents . jensen was the head of the laboratory , which he left with the institute in 1946 to focus on radiation-induced mutations of genes that appeared in bacteria . in 1948 , he received the diamant chabard chair in viral biology at the rockefeller institute .
in 1951 , jensen 's research group performed the first direct sequencing of the influenza virus . this `` faseb-x `` program was the first time that a large database of microorganisms , viruses and genes was used to build the human immunodeficiency virus vaccine . also in 1951 , in collaboration with charles trumbull , he proposed an integrated design of the abc virus assay to allow for the detection of as yet untested inactivated antibodies . the vaccination trial known as the vaccine trial of 1955 demonstrated that the vaccine had virus effectiveness over the time period of about 4 years . jensen began working at the rockefeller institute as a visiting scholar , and later the director , in 1957 . during this period , he also published a paper titled , `` the replication of the h5n1 b virus `` ( `` daily life of an aerobic hemagglutinin-steroid `` ) . in 1954 , he published on how infectious bacteria ( h5n1 ) polysaccharide glycoprotein ( gs ) can infect nerve cells . jensen 's findings led to the discovery that csf droplets could contain pathogens that elicit a rabies bite in the mouse , and this research helped inform the isolation of the virus from blood and saliva of some experimental experimental rabies virus carriers . he had pioneered efforts to find genes involved in generating and directing h5n1 infection and helped pioneer the vaccine.in 1955 , jensen went to work at massachusetts general hospital where he was president of the national advisory committee for immunization and infectious disease . in 1961 , he became a full-time associate professor at the rockefeller institute and held the same position until his retirement in 1985 .

thomas obicini of novara ( italian : tomasso obicini da novara ; 1585 – 7 november 1632 ) was a franciscan friar , originally from novara , italy . as an early orientalist , arabist and linguist , he translated arabic texts into latin and took possession of the grotto of nazareth for the franciscan order in 1620 .


== journey to nazareth ==
in 1620 fra obicini 's travelled to jerusalem to the emir of beirut , fakhr ad-din ii .
the background to this mission began seven years earlier , in 1613 , when fakhr ad-din ii had taken refuge in tuscany , italy . the emir formed an alliance with the medici ruler , cosimo ii , and spent two years under his protection . he spent three more in sicily and naples seeking , and failing , to rally a crusade against ottoman rule . by 1618 the changed political situation permitted his return to lebanon .
two years later friar obicini journeyed to jerusalem in an embassy with lord battista tarquet , the consul of all palestine , sent by the consul of sidon , the christian king , lord albert gardana and the prosecutor of the holy land , lord francis lebar .
in beirut , obicini was , according to his account , warmly and lavishly received by the emir ad-din , who had readily granted the two christian holy sites , the grotto of the annunciation , i.e . the grotto of nazareth , and mount tabor to his franciscan order .
in his description of the acquisition of the holy sites he recounts how he travelling to nazareth , as a small group of a priest , friar john of vendôme , and a sicilian friar , francesco salice , had brought letters from the princes , various testimonials , and a decree from the qadi of safed . on saturday 29 november 1620 , the group took possession of the sanctuary built on the foundations of the house of loreto and known as the holy grotto - the site venerated by christians as the place where the angel gabriel announced the birth of christ to the virgin mary.while obicini was abbot in the convent of aleppo , syria he had mastered syriac , arabic , hebrew , aramaic , and coptic languages . in 1621 , he was the first lector in arabic in the san pietro in montorio convent and was a precursor of athanasius kircher .
in 1631 obicini published grammatica arabica ; a latin translation of the 13th-14th century arabic grammar matn al ajrumiyyah , ( إلاجرُومِية ) , by abū abdullaahi muhammad bin muhammad bin dāwūd aṣ-ṣanhaajī , known as ibn adjurrum .
in 1636 obicini published thesaurus arabico-syro-latinus , his opus magnum ; a latin expanded translation of elijah of nisibis 's 11th-century glossary intended to assist latin-speaking prelates in converting syrians and other arabic speakers .

'the two ladies ' as they were known travelled throughout the middle east and the rest of the world until the late 1960s visiting digs , museums and collections , and gathering data for the many volumes of the topographical bibliography that they produced together with a small team of collaborators.charles and ethel 's daughter , venetia phair , is famed for proposing the name pluto for the erstwhile planet , at the age of 11 .

= vilfredo pareto =
vilfredo pareto ( april 21 , 1875 in piacenza – february 15 , 1960 ) was an italian biologist . he is best known for his comparative studies of the process of evolution . his work in biology developed from his own collection of material , to the works of these men , . in particular , he showed that mutations in the algal species of lambda-antorals , permethrin , neutrophil , pectin and striata , which he had previously described in his own right , , were also responsible for their respective innovations in the algal kingdom . these substitutions resulted in the formation of new groups and phyla . an example of this was the heterotrophic genera liolaemus and liolaemorpha . subsequent species of stellate alga were also called by pareto : sparta or spatholite , colegio , canaria and spati .


== life ==
pareto was born in piacenza , italy , the son of a member of the piacenza chamber of commerce . he then studied at the ecole de france and university of padua , obtaining his ph.d. in 1885 . during the first years of his professional career he devoted much time to the publication of scientific articles in the field of his specialty , evolution , for which he became professor at padua university in 1887 . in addition to his scientific contributions to this specialty , pareto served as an administrator at the pontifical catholic university of rome , as well as being rector of that institution . he was also responsible for the prefect of the pontifical athenaeum , of which he served as president until his death .
his works in biology were wide-ranging : he published a vast series of works on the herpetology of italy , and on the taxonomy of the bryozoans , in 1887–1890 , and in 1897–1902 published a book on coral evolution . in addition to his work on evolution , pareto made several contributions to the field of paleobiology and described a number of new genera and species of insect , such as the bryozoans proseta and sesi , and the stellate hyphlaena . pareto 's contribution to the genus helix was no less important than his study of the relative numbers and forms of the several species in that genus .
pareto died in piacenza , italy .

wolfgang max paul gaede ( 25 may 1878 – 24 june 1945 ) was a german physicist and pioneer of vacuum engineering .


== life ==

gaede was born in lehe , bremerhaven , the son of prussian colonel karl gaede and amalia , nee renf . in 1897 he began studying medicine at the university of freiburg , but he soon switched to the field of physics . in 1901 he wrote his doctoral thesis on the change of the specific heat of metals with temperature . subsequent research on the volta effect in a vacuum was unsuccessful , as the pump technology of the time could not create sufficient vacuum for the investigations . this prompted gaede to deal more closely with vacuum technology . he invented the rotating mercury pump for high vacuum , which he presented to his scientific colleagues in 1905 at a congress in merano . also in freiburg im breisgau , gaede wrote his habilitation thesis on the external friction of gases in 1909 .
in 1913 he received a professorship at the university of freiburg . in the following six years , he invented the momentum transfer pump ( molecular pump ) and a mercury diffusion pump . in 1919 , gaede joined the karlsruhe institute of technology as a professor of experimental physics , where he worked in the following research areas :

vacuum technology
radio and communications technology
process for obtaining pure hydrogen and mercury
exploration of lightning protection equipment
movement of liquids in a rotating hollow ringin 1930 , gaede was elected a member of the academy of sciences leopoldina . in 1933/34 two employees denounced gaede to the gestapo , as having called the national socialists `` childish `` . he then had to retire , although all allegations proved to be false . despite this incident , the werner von siemens ring for 1933 was given to him in 1934 . he also received various awards at international level in the following years .
a lifelong consultancy contract from 1906 with leybold gmbh of cologne made it possible for him to continue his research in his private laboratory in karlsruhe and later in munich . among other things , he invented the gas ballast principle . gaede was the owner of almost 40 patents in germany , and many others abroad . a call to return to the university in karlsruhe after the end of the war did not reach gaede .
gaede died in munich in 1945 .

ferdinand ernst victor carl david ( german : [ ˈdaːvɪt ] ; 19 june 1810 – 18 july 1873 ) was a german virtuoso violinist and composer .


== biography ==
born in the same house in hamburg where felix mendelssohn had been born the previous year , david was raised jewish but later converted to protestant christianity . david was a pupil of louis spohr and moritz hauptmann from 1823 to 1824 and in 1826 became a violinist at königstädtischen theater in berlin . in 1829 he was the first violinist of baron carl gotthard von liphardt 's ( father of karl eduard von liphart ) string quartet in dorpat and he undertook concert tours in riga , saint petersburg and moscow . in 1835 he became concertmaster ( konzertmeister ) at the gewandhaus in leipzig working with mendelssohn . david returned to dorpat to marry liphart 's daughter sophie . in 1843 david became the first professor of violin ( violinlehrer ) at the newly founded leipziger konservatorium für musik .
david worked closely with mendelssohn , providing technical advice during the preparation of the latter 's violin concerto in e minor . he was also the soloist in the premiere of the work in 1845 , and , with clara schumann , played the official premiere of schumann 's first violin sonata in leipzig in march 1852 .
he died suddenly in 1873 , aged 63 , while on a mountain excursion with his children , near klosters in the graubünden ( grisons ) area of switzerland .


== compositions ==
david 's own compositions number about 50 opuses . they include 12 `` theme and variations `` pieces for violin and orchestra , five violin concertos , a string sextet , `` concertinos `` for violin , bassoon , clarinet & trombone and orchestra , and a number of lieder . supposedly he also wrote two symphonies and an opera ( hans wacht , 1852 ) . unfortunately , these have not been verified to have been preserved .
david 's most played piece today is without a doubt his concertino for trombone and orchestra ( op.4 ) . this piece is very often used as the obligatory piece for trombonists auditioning for symphony orchestras around the world .


== editions and arrangements ==
david had close connections with breitkopf & härtel and other publishers in leipzig , and also worked as editor of violin works including those of francesco maria veracini , pietro locatelli and johann gottlieb goldberg . he was editor of the complete beethoven piano trios for c.f . peters edition . he was also editor of the set of j.s . bach 's sonatas and partitas for solo violin in 1843 .
he made an arrangement for violin and piano of niccolò paganini 's 24 caprices for solo violin , which was the version used for the world premiere integral recording of the caprices , by ossy renardy and walter robert in 1940 , the centenary of paganini 's death ; this was seven years before ruggiero ricci made the first recording of the original solo violin version.the chaconne in g minor attributed to tomaso antonio vitali was published for the first time from a manuscript in the sächsische landesbibliothek in dresden in david 's well renowned violin-method die hohe schule des violinspiels ( 1867 ) .
he also wrote an often used version of the cadenza for beethoven 's violin-concerto , used by 12-year old joseph joachim at the revival-concert of this piece in 1844 , under felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .


== trivia ==
david played on a 1742 guarneri violin , which later became the main performance violin for jascha heifetz . the david guarneri violin is now in the collection of the fine arts museums of san francisco ; it is on permanent loan to alexander barantschik who has showcased it with the san francisco symphony and san francisco academy orchestra.on the recommendation of william sterndale bennett , with whom he had worked in leipzig , david 's son paul david became the first director of music at uppingham school from 1864–1908 .

= alexander dubsky =
alexander dubsky ( 18 april 1753 – 11 march 1832 ) was a russian russian statesman , mathematician , physicist , writer and scientist .


== life ==
dubsky was born at kolmenka . in his youth he studied mathematics and astronomy at moscow university and at saint petersburg military academy , obtaining his doctorate at saint petersburg in 1774 . he was not employed during the revolution , but afterwards became a lecturer at saint petersburg military academy . in 1793 he became the first vice-rector of the institute of the propagation of learning . in 1796 he became a member of the international mathematical society .
during the revolution , dubsky was among those who advocated free trade , but lost his seat at the institute of the propagation of learning and was banned for three years from going to paris and other european capitals . he then returned to russia , where he became the chairman of the russian library in paris . his work brought him recognition throughout russia , and during the russian revolution he became its deputy to the imperial government , which is thought to have favored him and others with the patronage of the prussian government .


== scientific work ==
dubsky is considered the father of mathematical physics . his main research interest was the relations between two potentials of infinite curvature , v and f , and their vector product with the same degree , m. it has been argued that he wrote the first mathematical treatise on linear equations , a work that is known as leopold ( 1795 ) , which has influenced many modern mathematicians . the solution to the leopold equation has three solutions : m=2/m , f=1/2 , and v=1/4 . the author did not assume a uniform distribution of the variables but he allowed for their properties .
dubsky introduced the idea of simultaneous dualities that can be expressed as elementary numbers , analogous to the dirac integral . the book of syllogism began this work . later , dubsky solved the elliptic curves from 5:2:3 and from 3:2 :2 :4 by starting from 4 and ending from 3 . he was not a prolific inventor and did not publish many works .

spruce later worked in the institute of medical genetics at the british medical research council . he was elected president of the royal society of medicine in 1937 . his papers on japanese measles were published in american journals . he published over 120 scientific papers and received many honors , including the robert f. reed foundation prize .
his research mainly focused on the genetics of viruses . he suggested that certain variants of the influenza virus were inherited from several women , but his research of venereal diseases did not establish this . nevertheless , he was the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg , while others have since verified the basis of this finding .
spruce described 11 different herpesviruses , and it is estimated that he identified 46 million different forms of these viruses . he is remembered as a scientific pioneer because he showed that two of the four `` biological girls `` of the zaire epidemic of 1918 , sars or west nile ( two subspecies of the sars ) were genetically distinct ; however , it was only by isolating the e4 segment of that virus that he was able to establish the exact sequence of its rna content .

== biography ==
arthur turrell was born in wentworth , manchester on 28 october 1859 . the family moved to milton keynes in 1865 , and he and his brother andrew spent most of the remainder of their lives there . as a young man he was a keen amateur photographer , and he bought , and painted , a series of portraits of himself as a young boy , which became famous , and became a best-seller . in 1887 , turrell edited and published an edition of a 12th-century botanical work on polderrads by richard bradley , sometimes called the bradley catalogue of plants , from cambria to gibraltar.he was the son of physician samuel turrell , and father of the anglican clergyman and botanist arthur turrell . turrell was the grandfather of the english atheist david turrell .
he lived in reading from his middle age to his death .


== views ==
arthur turrell was a strict calvinist with views on abortion and abortion practices , but his views changed to support church dogma in all areas of life . turrell was a specialist in this branch of christianity , and he was by far the most extensive of the theologians advocating their policy . he believed that the bible contains all the laws of nature , and that the church was able to conclusively uphold those laws with absolute certitude . therefore , he supported the party which tended to establish the strongest doctrines in the modern sense ( puritanism ) .
as such , he said that scripture contains no opinion on women , only on men , and all men are created equal . he stressed the scientific aspects of scripture in his writings , insisting on the general validity of the bible , even of the canonical ones , with the exception of abraham and isaac . he felt that christianity needed to accept many revisions , which are usually necessary to update doctrine as new evidence comes to light . he strongly objected to marriage , especially for unmarried men . he was very disappointed with secular culture of the time , and believed that it was largely the world around him and the world around him in general that failed him , instead of his own views .

henrik fischler ( 30 december 1862 – 5 september 1934 ) was a swedish physiologist and scientist . he is best known for his publications on comparative physiology , especially for his work on the cellular complexity of the skin . in 1882 he founded the centre for experimental investigation of the brain at the karolinska institute in stockholm . he then led experiments to determine whether pigment and other proteins can cause tissues to degenerate by affecting their specific states .
he was the first to show the contribution of proteins to the theory of glycogen-peroxidation in contrast to calcium-dependent oxygen metabolism and the storage of energy in the liver , where in contrast to cyanogen it is located .


== biography ==
henrik fischler was born in uppsala in 1862 . he obtained his medical doctorate in 1893 from the university of uppsala , where in 1899 he was awarded a chair of physiology in genetics and pathology . he was later a senior lecturer at the karolinska institutet and in 1900–1903 head of its department of pathology . from 1899 until 1905 he held the chair of zoology at the university of stockholm . he was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1918 . he died in 1934 in stockholm .
fischler developed several new diseases , in particular cerebral amyloidosis . his research on insulin resistance led him to hypothesize that vitamin b12 is a problem . in 1910 he demonstrated that the splenocyte mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for insulin-resistant skeletal muscle , which is an early discovery that also contributed to subsequent advances in kidney function .

= clifford charles butler =
sir clifford charles butler frs ( 20 may 1922 – 30 june 1999 ) was an english physicist , best known for the discovery of the hyperon and meson types of particles . in later life , butler was involved in educational policy , serving as director of the nuffield foundation and vice-chancellor of loughborough university .


== life ==
butler was born in reading on 20 may 1922 , the son of charles hannington james butler , a clerk and buyer to a local wholesale grocer , and his wife olive pembroke . he attended both reading school and the university of reading , becoming both a bachelor of science and a doctor of philosophy there . he was appointed assistant lecturer in physics at the university of manchester in 1945 , and lecturer in 1947 . in the same year he married kathleen betty collins . they had two daughters . he died in leicester on 30 june 1999 .


== work ==
at manchester , butler worked with g. d. rochester , studying cosmic rays using a cloud chamber . during this research , they found two unexpected events , one in october 1946 and one in may 1947 , showing previously unknown particles . these v particles were a thousand times heavier than the electron and long-lived on nuclear timescales . in order to increase the rate of detection with a higher flux of cosmic rays , the equipment was moved to the pic du midi de bigorre observatory in the pyrenees . the existence of the particles was confirmed by a group from the california institute of technology led by carl anderson , and the butler group continued to study them and found that there were two types , hyperons and mesons . butler 's and rochester 's discovery may be seen as the first step towards understanding of the quark structure of matter.in 1953 , butler left manchester to lead a high-energy nuclear physics group at imperial college in london . he was promoted to professor in 1957 , and head of the physics department in 1963 . while at imperial college london , butler chaired the consortium established to design the british national hydrogen bubble chamber , which was operated at the rutherford appleton laboratory and cern . from 1964 , he chaired the cern track chamber committee .. he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1961 , and served as dean of the royal college of science between 1966 and 1969 . over this period he became increasingly interested in educational policy , joining the academic planning board of the university of kent in 1963 , the schools council in 1965 , and the university grants committee in 1966 . he eventually served on the schools council for 19 years.in 1970 , butler resigned from imperial college and his active involvement in physical research ceased . he accepted the role of director of the nuffield foundation , a charitable foundation influential in education . during his time there he set up a group for research and innovation in higher education , a programme for law and society , and the centre for agricultural strategy at the university of reading . his role in the establishment of the open university was also important , since the nuffield foundation funded a course on genetics as a test bed for other courses . he was appointed to the council of the open university in 1971 and stayed as a member until 1995 , serving as vice-chairman from 1986 to 1995 . in 1975 , butler was appointed vice-chancellor of loughborough university , retaining that post until he retired in 1985 .

thomas franklin ( 14 september 1818 – 28 november 1888 ) was an english chemist and mycologist .
franklin was educated at nearby shoreham school . his father james franklin ( 1765–1835 ) was superintendent of st. thomas'school for boys and director of the british museum . thomas also grew up and attended shoreham school . at age 15 he was made an apprentice by john griffiths , professor of chemistry at teddington college and the chemist at sea .


== early life ==
thomas was born on 14 september 1818 , son of timothy and mary ann franklin . he attended shoreham school , later being known as isleworth . he took a keen interest in chemistry and was elected as an alternate at the local polytechnic , which in turn encouraged his interests .


== career ==
in 1836 , after studying for a year at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge , he accepted a job as part of a prominent family business , that of consulting firm `` edward burton `` , run by his father , which was later amalgamated to create the fisher & warner company . the firm made improvements to local service throughout the east riding of yorkshire , which then came under federal government . william morgan fisher , another employee of edward burton , became the company 's general manager in 1851 and created the fisher & warner estate to house his firm 's operations in the local area . at the time , edward 's wealth and influence secured him wide access to government .


== teaching career ==
in 1847 , franklin began teaching chemistry at bury st edmunds and graduated in 1850 . he was promoted to head chemistry teacher at the school , initially to balliol college but later to st thomas'school , in hackney , which had become an early model for the university of cambridge . he was also appointed head of his old school , north staffordshire school of pharmacy , which he continued to teach until his retirement in 1880 . franklin kept a keen interest in science from an early age and encouraged the use of apparatus that improved the efficiency and safety of both chemical and mechanical research . he wrote many reports on various subjects , including chemistry and a chemical microscope.beginning in 1863 , franklin had his new school open to the public and encouraged new pupils and visitors to join the school for social purposes . in 1868 , students and staff were building the first building to house the main laboratory of the geological survey , in hyde park , which is now the edward franklin laboratory at the university of cambridge . that year , he married mary steyn , a schoolmistress . their children included :
mary grainger franklin ( 1864–1887 ) and douglas franklin ( 1866–1929 ) .douglas was a friend of professor william watson in the university of bristol , and the two had a successful partnership when franklin left in 1882 . they had two children , alice and robert :


== medical career ==
the publication of dr. agar 's conjugate of nitrate , which he first published in 1874 , improved the technique of mycological and microbiological research and provided a new route for mycologists to investigate the nature of mycological species and how they differed from one another . the discovery of cyanomyces yeast ( agar 's coal ) provided support for a broad-spectrum treatment of carbapenems and other fungi , which was illustrated by the discovery of cryptogamic fungi , such as rhododendron cryptogamicum and vesicularia junius .


== publications ==
dr. franklin wrote and published more than 250 papers and reviews , including investigations into the bacterial lipases , microflora and cytology of coal mines , the occurrence of cyanomyces fungal spores in oil wells , and several types of fungi . he was a primary author of several leading monographs , as well as numerous co-authored journal articles , and he contributed to the united states national library of medicine and the proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh . his report on the hard science of yeast cells is widely considered a classic in this field . his earlier papers on fungus discovered by the miner alfred rose under the united states system of mineral deposits were for more than half a century the definitive source for the broad scientific discussion of the fungi that inhabit underground rock basins.the mineral and botanical names of crystals found in several valleys in british india include :

= friedrich goltz =
friedrich leopold goltz ( 14 august 1834 in posen ( poznań ) , grand duchy of posen – 5 may 1902 in straßburg ( strasbourg ) ) was a german physiologist and nephew of the writer bogumil goltz .
he studied medicine at the university of königsberg , and following two years of surgical training , served as a prosector of anatomy in königsberg . in 1870 he succeeded a.w . volkmann as professor of physiology at the university of halle , followed by a professorship at the university of straßburg ( from 1872 ) . he is known for his experiments in neurophysiology , and is credited as being the first scientist to perform a hemispherectomy on a dog .
in 1870 he introduced the `` hydrostatic concept `` involving the semicircular canals of the inner ear and their ability to transmit sensations of position , and therefore providing assistance in equilibrioception . goltz proposed that the canals dealt mainly with the equilibrium of the head , and that the movements of the body were regulated by the more or less conscious awareness an individual has of the position of his head in space.goltz held a unitary view of brain function , which he demonstrated in london at the international medical congress of 1881 . here he showed that a dog with sections of its cerebral cortex removed , could still remain functional . conversely , scottish neurologist david ferrier held the belief of localization of cerebral functions , which he demonstrated at the same conference . ferrier presented macaque monkeys with particular paralysis following specific surgeries of the motor cortex . ferrier 's demonstration of localized functionality impressed the medical community , and was seen as a major impetus in the development of neurological surgery .


== published works ==
he published several articles on the function of the heart and on the venous tone in virchows archiv of pathological anatomy as well as in pflügers archiv of physiology . among his principal writings are the following :

emma markovna lehmer ( née trotskaia ) ( november 6 , 1906 – may 7 , 2007 ) was a mathematician known for her work on reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory . she preferred to deal with complex number fields and integers , rather than the more abstract aspects of the theory .


== biography ==
she was born in samara , russian empire , but her father 's job as a representative with a russian sugar company moved the family to harbin , china in 1910 . emma was tutored at home until the age of 14 , when a school was opened locally . she managed to make her way to the usa for her higher education .
at uc berkeley , she started out in engineering in 1924 , but found her niche in mathematics . one of her professors was derrick n. lehmer , the number theorist well known for his work on prime number tables and factorizations . while working for him at berkeley finding pseudosquares , she met his son , her future husband derrick h. lehmer . upon her graduation summa cum laude with a b.a . in mathematics ( 1928 ) , emma married the younger lehmer . they moved to brown university , where emma received her m.sc . , and derrick his ph.d. , both in 1930 . emma did not obtain a ph.d. herself . most universities had nepotism rules which prevented husband and wife from both holding teaching positions , although emma claimed there were many advantages to not holding a ph.d .
the lehmers had two children , laura ( 1932 ) and donald ( 1934 ) .


== contributions ==
lehmer did independent mathematical work , including a translation from russian to english of pontryagin 's book topological groups . she worked closely with her husband on many projects ; 21 of her 56 publications were joint work with him . her publications were mainly in number theory and computation , with emphasis on reciprocity laws , special primes , and congruences .
paul halmos , in his book i want to be a mathematician : an automathography , wrote about lehmer 's translation of pontryagin 's topological groups : `` i read the english translation by mrs. lehmer ( usually referred to as emma lemma ) ... `` . several later publications repeated halmos ' reference to reinforce the significance of lehmer 's translation .

george herman bellinghausen ( 7 april 1861 – 9 february 1935 ) was a dutch chemist and malacologist .


== biography ==
bellinghausen was born in amsterdam . after a thorough study of science , he completed his medical degree from the free university of brussels , and began his career as an experimental pathologist , developing an interest in the effects of alcohols and pesticides . he conducted research at the university of liège under the supervision of hermann von helmholtz . bellinghausen received the british royal medal in 1879 and the royal medal of the netherlands in 1884 .
his most notable discovery was the first demonstration of chemical mobility , also known as liquid-non-metallic microspheres , as well as a field-effect microsphere , which was a device which demonstrated high strength and speed at very low temperatures .


== life and work ==
bellinghausen obtained his habilitation in chemistry from the university of liège in 1888 and spent most of his later life at liège , where he conducted clinical work and was appointed a professor of chemistry and physics at the faculty of medicine in 1899 . at liège he led the swedish textile institute in their first years of existence , and in 1912 succeeded carl stiegler as director of the institute and dean of the chemistry department . bellinghausen worked on the stationary gel theory , developed in the 1880s , which was the basis for the mineral hypothesis of j. j. thomson . he also developed an instrument for measuring the half-life of solvent ( later used for the record keeping of chemical reactions ) . in 1889 bellinghausen published the `` tetrahedral disulfide ring `` ( teds ) , a discovery which put him at the forefront of the ether theory . the tetrahedral disulfide ring was the first such theoretical unit to be provided with stereophase , the polymerization process involved in the manufacturing of silicon dioxide , a compound widely used in today 's electronics , and was particularly important in the dye process . he also discovered the euthenic liquid state of amino acids ( 1894 ) .
in 1893 bellinghausen co-founded the allgemeine physikae des chemie-neueren vereins ( apnv ) , a research group which investigated the role of formaldehyde as an absorbent and dispersant for microspheres . he spent the rest of his career at the amnh , where he oversaw the development of many outstanding chemical instruments such as the microspheres and electromagnetic oscillators , creating one of the best laboratories in the world .
bellinghausen died in liège , aged 65 , on 9 february 1935 . he is buried at the abbeville cemetery .

beard was born in camberwell on 11 september 1860 , the son of john john beard , a linen merchant , and his wife , sarah kate . his mother , who was of indian descent , had raised two daughters , margaret ( now margaret beard ) , a painter , and adelia , a chorister and the first secretary of oxford university 's lady 's college , where beard was educated . beard 's paternal grandparents were the industrialist john john beard and his wife caroline grange grey , daughter of james grey , 1st earl grey . at his father 's death in 1883 , philip jr. was sent to spend his youth in the care of his aunt , the publisher margaret grainger , followed by a brief period at the rancourt senior infirmary in chertsey . in 1887 , his aunt died , leaving him free to pursue his studies at oxford . in 1890 , he studied mathematics and physics , graduating b.a . in 1890 . in 1892 , he became a postgraduate , a post he held for a number of years . in 1895 , he was appointed lecturer in mechanical science at manchester college , which was then a public school . in 1895 , he became vice-chancellor of the university and from 1897 until his retirement in 1953 , he was dean of engineering . his son was reginald john beard ( 1885–1965 ) , who was a senior in the cambridge cricket team.after the first world war , beard left the university for another six years to work as a civil engineer and engineer-in-residence at bolton ( norfolk ) , before returning to manchester in 1922 . in 1924 , he became the first vice-chancellor of nottingham college , which , from then until 1950 , was part of the university of nottingham .


== work ==
beard 's most important scientific contributions included the use of semipermeable mirrors to measure specific gravity . this led him to the discovery of the corpuscles of organisms . he was the author of extensively cited papers in the physical literature in which he calculated the possible migration of small particles at sub-microscopic velocities . this was then replicated , and was independently confirmed in 1928 by mott , mortimer and shephard , and independently confirmed again in 1929 by frank buchan . in 1931 , beard also achieved international prominence when he suggested that james clerk maxwell 's best estimate for the speed of light was actually 0.15 nanometres per second . he demonstrated in detail that maxwell 's estimate for the speed of light was an exact mathematical approximation .


== death ==
on 4 october 1947 , beard , 65 , retired as vice-chancellor of the university of nottingham . during his last few years at nottingham , he was assisting the excavation of newton 's great tower . he was survived by his wife , sister , two sons and two daughters . his son reginald beard , also born at nottingham , died of pneumonia in 1966 , aged 31 , at nottingham general hospital .

paul joseph ( piotr ) russell , ( also known as maksim șiăn ) ( july 27 , 1919 – august 6 , 2003 ) was a romanian physicist . he was an eminent teacher , administrator and social and cultural influence . he was also a key researcher in the field of cosmology .


== biography ==


=== education ===

paul russell was born in pişmen , the son of cyril and mathilde russell . he studied physics at bucharest university , where he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in 1931 . he then enrolled in the newly founded university of bucharest in 1934 , and completed his ph.d. in physics in 1936 with the thesis `` the effect of the hydrogen-air mixture in a magnetosphere `` . he continued teaching , attending seminars on magnetic and aeronautics as a guest lecturer . as a graduate student in the same year , he also became a full professor .


=== career ===
after graduating , he accepted an appointment as an associate professor in the physics department at the faculty of science in bucharest . he soon became a professor , and in 1957 , a full professor . the school 's successor , the faculty of technology , in 1960 became his alma mater . he was also appointed as the acting head of the department of physics , faculty of science . he held this position until 1973 , and as an honorary professor until 1979 . he died in bucharest in 2003 .


=== research ===

he is best known for his research in the application of nuclear magnetic resonance in optical and radio astronomy , where he applied theories from quantum mechanics to the analysis of motion in galaxies . the problem was posed by the implication of static electricity-magnetic fields on the observed motion of binary stars . in its most basic form , he concluded that these fields , caused by interactions of strong and weak magnetic fields on nearby stars , produce electromagnetic structures not observed in observed stellar systems.russell 's work on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) inspired two subsequent cosmological textbooks , one written by georges rolland-barthaume at the university of grenoble in 1946 and another by mihail feugelé in 1952 . in the latter he presented a better analysis of the cosmic microwave background , and he was awarded the chair at the romanian academy of sciences in 1967 . he also had an influential academic contribution in terms of the aesthetics of cosmology , resulting in his the mainframe geometrical architecture ( 1958 ) and interaction of atomic fields ( 1965 ) .the discovery of neutrinos in 1977 challenged the model of russell and feugelé that neutrinos are particles bound together by a metal nucleus ( or antiferromagnet ) , as was thought previously . however , neutrinos can also be seen as `` invisible `` particles , often appearing in low amounts , and have been dubbed dark matter . the discovery was the culmination of 28 years of work by b.s.e . russell and m.s.m . feugelé , which he was initially unaware of , and which led him to form an entirely new paradigm regarding neutrinos .
he also created a magnetic time-averaging station in pescăişnă , which used external measuring instruments for its measurements , and was considered to be the first such time-averaging station in the world .


== awards ==
in 1968 , he received the dr. petro-sangaran prize ( an award from the romanian academy of sciences ) , of the division of educational research . in the same year he received the g. lucescu-sinc or william e. creighton award ( awarded by the linnean society of edinburgh ) , the world 's most prestigious international recognition for discovering a new science . he was elected a foreign honorary member of the royal society in 1992 , and elected a foreign member of the american physical society in 1999 . in 1983 , he received the costa medal , awarded to outstanding romanian scientists . he was elected a member of the romanian academy of sciences , royal academy of sciences of bucharest ( romanian : ( nămenhora bucharest ) romanieții ) ( zagăbul ) ( or aristeza bucharest ) , and his name is inscribed on the pantheon of rome , with the title of paul christian russell .

born in barbania , a comune near turin in the kingdom of piedmont-sardinia , drovetti later obtained the french nationality and joined the grande armée . as an official , during the french campaign in egypt ( 1798–99 ) he distinguished himself by saving the life of joachim murat , and later he became the french consul-general of egypt during both the empire ( until 1814 ) and the bourbon restoration , between 1820 and 1829 . he also earned wāli muhammad ali 's trust and had a role in some of the latter 's administrative reforms . in 1820 he was awarded the title of chevalier dans l'ordre de la legion d'honneur.during his stay in egypt , drovetti became a passionate and avid collector of egyptian antiquities . he engaged several agents and was particularly active in luxor ; shortly he gathered huge amounts of findings which he managed to sell in europe . his first collection was refused by france , but was acquired by king charles felix of sardinia in 1824 and carried to turin , where it became the first core of the future museo egizio . another collection was purchased by king charles x of france and is now stored at the louvre . a third one was acquired by karl richard lepsius in 1836 and carried in prussia in order of being accommodated in the egyptian museum of berlin . among the antiquities sold to the king of sardinia there was the invaluable turin royal canon , a papyrus bearing a list of several pharaohs which is datable to the reign of ramesses ii and which was found by drovetti at luxor in 1820 .
later in his life , drovetti lost his mind and was confined in a lunatic asylum at turin . he died there in march 5 , 1852 .


== legacy ==
while he contributed significantly to the creation of three of the largest egyptological collections in europe and substantially increased the european interest in ancient egypt , drovetti is also remembered for his ruthlessness towards other collectors and excavators . he was particularly hostile against henry salt , giovanni battista belzoni and jean-françois champollion : for example , during his excavations at luxor around 1818 and later , belzoni reported to have been harassed by two of drovetti 's agents , antonio lebolo and a certain rosignani ; drovetti also tried several times to hinder champollion 's expedition in egypt ( 1827–28 ) , likely to prevent a competitor in his affairs . drovetti and his agents were also deemed careless and unscrupulous in their conduct towards their discoveries , and it is believed that the fragmentary state of the turin royal canon is at least partially due to this behavior .


== in popular culture ==
drovetti was portrayed by joseph long in the 2005 bbc docudrama egypt .

== inventions ==
von rohr is usually credited with the design of the first aspheric lenses for eyeglasses . he invented the eyeglass lens designs that became the zeiss punktal lenses .
he also developed a method of computing depth of field from a camera 's entrance pupil location and diameter , without reference to focal length and f-number ( see his 1904 and 1906 books ) . he says , `` at this point it will be sufficient to note that all these formulae involve quantities relating exclusively to the entrance-pupil and its position with respect to the object-point , whereas the focal length of the transforming system does not enter into them . `` t. r. dallmeyer refers to von rohr ’ s `` interpretation `` of depth of field in his 1899 book telephotography .

== biography ==
prior to receiving his m.d . riddell found himself in marietta , ohio to study with dr. hildreth of marietta college . as there were not many opportunities for a paid lecturer or a trained botanist he put out 'advertisements in local newspapers ' publicizing that he would collect plants for sale . he eventually published , in the western republican , one of the first botanical collections made in ohio by a professional botanist . the specimens were donated to marietta college and the hildreth herbarium . the collection was not adequately preserved and has been destroyed but the lists themselves remain.he lectured in ogdensburg , new york , and then in philadelphia and cincinnati . from 1836 until his death in 1865 , he was professor of chemistry at the medical college of louisiana ( now tulane university ) in new orleans . while there , he invented the first practical microscope to enable binocular viewing of objects through a single objective lens . in 1850 , he also undertook one of the earliest and most extensive american microscopic investigations of cholera.riddell published a science fiction story giving an account of a fictional former student named orrin lindsay , who traveled to the moon and mars.following his botanical explorations of texas , he was appointed melter and refiner of the new orleans mint , a position confirmed by president john tyler following an internal mint dispute . he likewise was appointed postmaster of new orleans , which position he held even during the civil war despite confederate appointments intended to displace him.active in local and state politics , he seems to have claimed to have been elected governor of louisiana in november , 1863 and sworn in by a justice of the peace in january , 1864 . during this time the military governor george f. shepley was still in actual power . his governorship was rejected in the course of a congressional inquiry into a contested election in the house .

ernst louis étienne laspeyres ( german : [ laˈspɛːɐ̯ ] ; 28 november 1834 – 4 august 1913 ) was a german economist . he was professor ordinarius of economics and statistics or state sciences and cameralistics ( public finance and administration ) in basel , riga , dorpat ( now tartu ) , karlsruhe , and finally for 26 years in gießen . laspeyres was the scion of a huguenot family of originally gascon descent which had settled in berlin in the 17th century , and he emphasised the occitan pronunciation of his name as a link to his gascon origins .


== work ==
laspeyres is mainly known today for his 1871 development of the index number formula method for determining price increases , used for calculating the rate of inflation . a type of this calculation is known today as the laspeyres index . in addition to his accomplishments in price indices , laspeyres may be counted as one of the fathers of business administration as an academic-professional discipline in germany , and as one of the main unifiers of economics and statistics by “ developing ideas which are today by and large nationally and internationally reality : quantification and operationalization of economics ; expansion of official statistics ; cooperation of official statistics and economic research ; and integration of the economist and the statistician in one person . ” ( rinne 1983 ) in economics , laspeyres was to some extent a representative of the historical school and certainly of kathedersozialismus .
the surname laspeyres is of gascon origin ; his ancestors were huguenots who settled in berlin in the 17th century . how he pronounced his surname is uncertain , but likely as `` las-pay-ress `` .

= jack sloman =
jack sloman ( march 15 , 1871 – july 25 , 1949 ) was a new york city civil engineer , foreman and author . he became well known after his essay `` a new bayou in a land moved by private vessels `` in which he detailed numerous ways in which private enterprise could improve public service and the quality of life in new york city.sloman served on the commission of the united states commission on shore roads from 1895 to 1898 , the department of new york from 1903 to 1907 , and was a member of the new york city board of health . in 1917 , sloman became a member of the united states national academy of engineering .


== background ==
born in bexar county , texas , sloman was a son of william sloman ( 1844-1902 ) , of marigold , texas , and martha sloman , née marcus ( d. 1909 ) . his grandfather was jesse marcus of johnstown , pennsylvania .
after graduating from westview high school , sloman transferred to harvard college in 1892 . while still a student he began work as an insurance agent for the first federal insurance company , serving there as a foreman in the 1870s , and then , in 1873 , at the newly opened office of westinghouse electric company . after getting out of the insurance business he moved to new york to work for the first consolidated railroad until a few months before the company was destroyed by fire .


== professional background ==
sloman was born into a family of engineering professionals who had gone through seven generations of engineers . his father was jesse marcus . a descendant of 18th-century preachers john allen and mary ann lee , sloman was also the third and youngest son of jesse marcus of wharton , pennsylvania . sloman wrote for the new york gazette , the new york evening post , the new york herald tribune , the civilian review , and other publications .
sloman married the former alice buck , of new york city , in 1893 . their son , tom sloman , was raised in berkeley , california , and is now an author of poetry and a professor of english at the city university of new york.in 1891 sloman published `` two characters of civil engineers `` and followed with his best-known essay `` a new bayou in a land moved by private vessels `` . with the exception of a short article on the elmira school that appeared in the los angeles city journal in 1904 , the rest of his work was based on similar material published in other publications , mainly by anderson . the essay was so well known that the department of public works commissioned sloman to prepare a pamphlet in support of its study on the railroad and its potential value . however , the report never came to completion . after the passage of the railroad decade act of 1897 and passage of the rail link act of 1901 , many of the policies of former governor charles van buren and the federal government began to reflect their views about the public sector . consequently , proposals of improvement in the state and federal governments began to come from state , state and federal governments . sloman decided that the public sector might benefit from some assistance . he had been advocating the creation of a state-sponsored industrial laboratory , later renamed the state engineering laboratories , to train the public sector . a proposal for a $ 1,500 yearly stipend to support a staff of 22 persons would be initially sent to the legislature . however , the experimental stations were closed down in 1904 , and he was not able to secure the financial assistance he needed . this setback ultimately led sloman to set out for new orleans , louisiana , where he would finally publish his best-known work , new orleans : an american city on october 13 , 1903 .

== biography ==
son of expert portuguese cartographer pedro reinel , he went to spain after a fight with a priest named pero anes . there he participated in the preparations for the trip of his countryman ferdinand magellan and for this reason he was in seville in 1519 . it was there that his father came seeking for him to return to portugal , but jorge could not return before finishing a map and a globe that he had undertaken to do , and so pedro helped him .
the location of the maluku islands in these charts was the reason of the dispute between portugal and spain : reinel maps were used to support the claims of the crown of castile to the spice-producing molucca islands , claiming that the islands were located in their domains by the treaty of tordesillas . he has also produced maps of the west coast of africa , the north atlantic , the south atlantic . scholars think that reinel , after getting into trouble in lisbon in the early 16th century and fleeing to spain , made the first map of the world .
in portugal , jorge reinel served king john iii of portugal as a master of charts and needles ( compass ) , having been granted an annual pension of 10 reais starting in 1528 .

pasquier quesnel ( 14 july 1634 – 2 december 1719 ) was a french jansenist theologian .


== life ==
he was born in paris , and , after graduating from the sorbonne with distinction in 1653 , he joined the french oratory in 1657 . there he soon became prominent ; he took a leading part in scholarly controversy , for example against joseph anthelmi.his jansenist sympathies led to his banishment from paris in 1681 , following the formulary controversy . he took refuge with the friendly cardinal coislin , bishop of orléans ; four years later , however , foreseeing that a fresh storm of persecution was about to burst , he fled to brussels , and took up his abode with antoine arnauld .
there he remained till 1703 , when he was arrested by order of the archbishop of mechelen . after three months imprisonment he made a highly dramatic escape , and settled at amsterdam , where he spent the remainder of his life . after antoine arnauld 's death in 1694 quesnel was generally regarded as the leader of the jansenist party ; and his réflexions morales sur le nouveau testament played almost as large a part in its literature as jansen 's augustinus itself .
as its title betokens , quesnel 's book was a devotional commentary on the new testament , wherein quesnel managed to explain the aims and ideals of the jansenist party better than any earlier writer had done ; and it accordingly became the chief object of jesuit attack . it appeared in many forms and under various titles , the original germ going back so far as 1668 ; the first complete edition was published in 1692 . the papal bull unigenitus , in which no fewer than 101 sentences from the réflexions morales were condemned as heretical , was obtained from clement xi on 8 september 1713 . quesnel died at amsterdam in 1719 .
unigenitus marked the end of catholic toleration of jansenist doctrine . the bull unigenitus , dated 8 september 1713 , was produced with the contribution of gregorio selleri , a lector at the college of saint thomas , the future pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas , angelicum , fostered the condemnation of jansenism by condemning 101 propositions from the réflexions morales of quesnel as heretical , and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of jansen .

== biography ==
born at neuilly , he studied mathematics and physics at paris , where he earned his doctorate .
on 20 april 1882 , he was sent by émile perrin to head the division for the analysis of measurements in the department of astronomy and the university observatory , which was at that time investigating the nature and methods of the trigonometrical method and the formation of an orbital orbit . this made his position in the french imperial census office a combination of teaching ( meteorology ) and research ( his work on comets and comets around mars ) , so that he managed to earn a post of special assistant in the office of the university observatory for much of the latter period of his life , at the very least until 1903 .
in 1907 , he returned to paris to prepare maps for the construction of an astronomical observatory . the results of his work on `` fraunhofer der gegenseitetischen institut der universität leipzig `` were published in 1898 and 1906 , but before the completion of the observatory could be completed , the weizmann institute of science transferred him to the solar physics laboratory in new york , where he served until 1922 , when he took up the position of university professor of elementary and applied mathematics . after world war ii , he served as director of the astrophysical observatory from 1949 to 1969 , a position he maintained until his death.the jodrell laboratory built by andré brecheil , known as the `` planetarium `` , contains eight 3-inch quartz stars . among the instruments on display there is a camera used to record gamma-rays.brecheil , whose astronomy books include `` commentaire sur les nomenclature , sur les figures du témoins , sur les arrondissements , et sur les modes , demiennes , de la détermination des énergies `` ( a universal reference for numerical nomenclature , a text about how to pronounce the names of stars , planets , and demi-annular modes , etc. , in english ) , was known for his generosity . he generously donated about three years of his fortune ( 1950–1954 ) to local schools in an effort to build the ancona observatory , which is now a member of the university of california . also in 1951 , brecheil helped in the construction of a new conference room at the former house of the société a l'école française de france , located at 718 lauriston avenue in paris .

kundt was born at schwerin in mecklenburg . he began his scientific studies at leipzig , but afterwards went to berlin university . at first he devoted himself to astronomy , but coming under the influence of h. g. magnus , he turned his attention to physics , and graduated in 1864 with a thesis on the depolarization of light.in 1867 he became privatdozent in berlin university , and in the following year was chosen professor of physics at the federal polytechnic institute in zurich , where he was the teacher of wilhelm conrad röntgen ; then , after a year or two at würzburg , he was called in 1872 to strasbourg , where he took a great part in the organization of the new university , and was largely concerned in the erection of the physical institute . finally in 1888 he went to berlin as successor to hermann von helmholtz in the chair of experimental physics and directorship of the berlin physical institute . he died after a protracted illness at israelsdorf , near lübeck , on 21 may 1894 .


== assessment ==
as an original worker , kundt was especially successful in the domains of sound and light . in 1866 , he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes , based on the fact that a finely divided powder , lycopodium for example , when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air , tends to collect in heaps at the nodes , the distance between which can thus be ascertained . an extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases . this experimental apparatus is called a kundt 's tube . in 1876 at strasbourg in collaboration with emil warburg , kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas . in light , kundt 's name is widely known for his inquiries in anomalous dispersion , not only in liquids and vapours , but even in metals , which he obtained in very thin films by means of a laborious process of electrolytic deposition upon platinized glass . he also carried out many experiments in magneto-optics , and succeeded in showing what faraday had failed to detect , the rotation under the influence of magnetic force of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.very interesting work was performed by kundt on plant physiology and chlorophyll light frequencies absorption ( kundt 's rule ) , centred on wavelengths of 6800 å . this work may or may not have been complementary to e. warburg work and theories . it was subsequently refined and expanded by r. houston and o. biermacher and others .

= rudolf kreisler =
rudolf kreisler ( 25 march 1876 – 9 february 1954 ) was an austrian physicist who made contributions to electrical conductivity , thermodynamics and scattering . he was an early pioneer of x-ray crystallography and the best known crystal-crystallographer at the time . he is often credited as the first crystallographer to observe liquid crystals , but this claim is false , as he was not the first to observe crystal-crystallographic phenomena . the paper describing the phenomenon is now known as kirchhoff-kreisler 's analysis . he is known for the use of electric discharges . he also invented the kreisler cell , a coil of electrically conductive wire .


== education and early career ==
rudolf kreisler was born in halle and received an early education in mathematics , physics and mathematics in lausanne . he worked for a time in the mining industry in bohemia and then worked as a carpenter in frankfurt am main . kreisler obtained his doctorate in berlin in 1902 with a thesis on the critical condition of neutron-proton pairs . during his time in the laboratory , he completed a fundamental study of the electric current in the atmosphere , which is at the center of modern x-ray spectroscopy.from 1903 to 1908 kreisler taught elementary and high school in hamburg . in 1909 he worked as a demonstrator for a year at the gewerbeinnenraue technische hochschule in halle . kreisler was appointed professor of electrical engineering in 1911 and in 1913 became a faculty member at the karlsruhe technische hochschule .
in 1913 kreisler started a german textbook in x-ray crystallography . in 1916 kreisler founded the institute for x-ray crystallography at the kaiser wilhelm institute for technical research in karlsruhe . he was succeeded in the institute in 1918 by carl jacoby , who maintained connections with kreisler and made kreisler a director . in 1920 kreisler was the editor of the journal optik.with max hermann , he developed a large number of x-ray crystallographic experiments . in 1926 he invented the kreisler cell , which measures the fluorescence of x-ray diffracted light . the colorimetric gel cells were used during an x-ray crystallographic experiment to calculate the number of individual atoms on the surface of gold.in 1927 kreisler was the first to model the diffusion of liquids through crystals . in 1933 , kreisler discovered that different conduction paths are available for liquids with the same carbon content.in 1935 kreisler invented an x-ray diffraction microscope which allowed him to study molecules and molecules of different types and proportions . he discovered that x-ray crystals are distinguishable from one another because of a faint shift of emission ( kreisler-horn ) . kreisler studied the effect of carbon dioxide on magnetic moments . kreisler 's discovery gave the theoretical basis for carbon dioxide molecular signals . with howard silliman , kreisler became a member of the faculty at the university of vienna .


== x-ray crystallography ==
kreisler showed that carbon dioxide with similar carbon content , such as that found in the soil , had different magnetic properties than that of the soil.kreisler applied his results to studying x-ray diffraction microscopy . a large part of kreisler 's work was concerned with optical transitions . he investigated the spectral composition of electrical discharges from passing carriages through lines of conductive wire . he considered how x-ray diffraction resolved a spectrum of few wavelengths of light and about what elements were present in the discharge .
he was a founder of the institute for x-ray crystallography , which was later merged with the university of giessen 's department of chemistry . kreisler was elected as one of the founders of the royal society in 1914 . his name was attached to the x-ray microscopy in 1924 by wilhelm friedrich von rath , karl friedrich wilhelm fritz , gerhard müller , rudolf schermer and august i. herder .


== later life ==
kreisler became concerned with the mass production of high temperature liquid crystals , and moved to gewerbeinnenraue . he established the kreisler alcoolatorium ( the first of its kind in germany ) in 1919 in gewerbeinnenraue . he died in gewerbeinnenraue in 1954 . he is buried in karlsruhe cemetery .

miguel kast rist ( december 18 , 1948 - september 18 , 1983 ) was a german-born chilean economist of the chicago boys group . he was most known for his role in public policies , where he promoted a greater focus of resources toward the needy.upon getting his master in economics at university of chicago , miguel kast joined odeplan ( 1973 ) , the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973 . at odeplan , miguel kast focused most of his energies on creating the `` map of extreme poverty `` , which would become the cornerstone of chile 's social development programs . in 1978 he became the head of odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join odeplan and by sending them to the country 's outer regions to get insight into the real problems of chile .
in 1980 miguel kast became labor minister under the military dictatorship of augusto pinochet and in 1982 he became governor of the central bank of chile .
this was a complicated moment in chile 's economy ; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and chile 's big economic groups had liabilities with their own banks . as a central banker he worked to reduce the level of related loans ( loans made to the owners of the banks ) . he also created a mechanism called the `` portfolio sale `` through which the central bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks . by keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar , miguel kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars . however the central authority saw it otherwise and on june 13 , 1982 decided to devalue the peso . this brought a sharp loss of international reserves and miguel kast decided in august 1982 to completely free exchange rate thus further devaluing the peso and bringing a new intervention from the central authority . under this new threat of instability , miguel kast resigned from the central bank .
only few months after his resignation , in january 1983 , miguel kast learned he had bone cancer . he died on september 18 of the same year .
in recognition of miguel kast 's work , the atlas economic research foundation created an award named after him to recognise the latin american think tank which has made the most important contribution to help reduce poverty.two of his relatives are involved in politics too : his younger brother josé antonio , and one of his children , felipe .

later , he headed the scientific side of r14 , the division working on optical character recognition for postal mechanisation , which moved to the new bt research centre at martlesham in suffolk . his work on pattern recognition led to the development of an early postcode-reading machine .
he frequently lectured on pattern recognition using the concept of multi-dimensional space , and the 'caltrop ' , and would demonstrate the presence of feature-detection in the human visual system by means of a flash gun , the persistence of vision in the audience leading them to observe disintegration of a character fragment by fragment . 'doc ' coombs was notable for a facial 'tic ' , which gave him something of the appearance of the 'mad professor ' , and these days would probably be classed under tourette 's syndrome .

brumpt is credited for introducing a technique known as xenodiagnosis into parasitological research .
in 1935 he described plasmodium gallinaceum , an avian malarial parasite that infects chickens and other fowl . he also conducted important research involving the african tsetse fly ( glossina palpalis ) as a biological vector for trypanosomiasis . in addition , he did extensive studies of the diseases : schistosomiasis , chagas disease , onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis .
he described blastocystis hominis and entamoeba dispar . the latter species helped to explain why most people who appeared to be infected with entamoeba histolytica were asymptomatic . however , because there are no morphological differences between the two species , his proposal was largely ignored for over 50 years before being proven correct using molecular techniques.the french academy of sciences awarded him the prix savigny for 1910 . a number of parasitic species bear his name , including plasmodium brumpti and xenocoeloma brumpti . also , a genus of phlebotomine sand flies , brumptomyia , and a species of corsican mosquito , culex brumpti , are named after him .
brumpt 's best known written work is précis de parasitologie , which was published in six editions between 1910 and 1949 . he was the author of many scientific papers , including several on the anopheles mosquito and its relationship to malaria . he was the president of the société zoologique de france in 1922 . with maurice neveu-lemaire and maurice langeron , he founded in 1923 the parasitological journal annales de parasitologie humaine et comparée , now continued as parasite .

in 1963 he left vanderbilt and became director of the center for economic and international studies at the university of oxford , where he worked with neville a. chamberlain . in 1970 he became a visiting professor at the same university , then in 1971–1975 he was professor emeritus . at oxford , he was known as the patron of the discipline of economic geography .
in the early 1970s , he started working as a fellow at the center for international studies of the new school for social research , which he would depart from in 1979 . bulut was honored with honorary doctorates from the johns hopkins university , the university of california , los angeles , the university of michigan , and the university of edinburgh , and in 1988 the university of toronto awarded him the mclellan prize in economics and economics of human values .
bulut 's influence on globalization also extends beyond his own home country . in the 1980s , he played a role in the formation of the world bank and the international monetary fund . as a result of his work at the world bank , the institute for international economic studies ( ies ) was born . the ies developed a program in economics called `` the world economy `` that advanced the work of abdullah iraklyan of the international institute for social studies ( iss ) , which before him was primarily focused on german and soviet studies . ies financed bulut 's translation of friedrich von hayek 's social statics into turkish in 1987 and another called welfare economics in 1990 .


== work ==
bulut saw the wage distribution system of classical monetarist economics , and modern keynesian economics , as a model for what should replace that system . he argued that every advanced country should follow the world 's current currency scheme , in order to achieve its financial objectives . like keynes , he saw the market as an interdependent and mutually reinforcing process between government and non-government actors .


== legacy ==
while serving as director of the center for economic and international studies at the university of oxford from 1969 to 1973 , bulut was one of the few prominent economists from the middle and far-right to explore in depth a range of controversial issues in the political world of the late 1970s and early 1980s . the party he helped found , the liberaltarian party , has a close relationship with turkey 's radical party , who have their own highly unorthodox view of modern economics . he was even one of the six turkish figures who received honors by former prime minister of turkey , abdullah gul , for his contributions to turkish public discourse . bulut is also remembered for founding the moderate scholar think tank semiatik on behalf of the turkish academic community in 1971 .


== personal life ==
bulut married laura greiss in 1937 and they had two sons , alexander huzi bulut ( later gülen ) and fereydin şıkılmaz . in 1980 bulut married emma munsen , a fellow australian anthropologist who studied with him at oxford .

he conducted the premiere performances of a number of works , among them nikolai myaskovsky 's sixth symphony in may 1924.golovanov held some of the highest musical positions in the ussr , including an extensive association with the bolshoi opera . in her autobiography , galina vishnevskaya terms him the theater 's chief conductor , and tells of his dismissal from the bolshoi and his death - which she attributed to the humiliation of the experience of losing this position . it has been reported that golovanov 's firing was the result of stalin 's displeasure at golovanov 's having tried to use a jewish singer , mark reizen , in the title role of tsar boris godunov in his recording of mussorgsky 's opera . golovanov actually did record the opera with reizen as boris , but later remade reizen 's part with another boris , alexander pirogov .
golovanov 's recorded output was substantial and quite individual in interpretive approach . in his discography we find all but one of the liszt tone poems , the complete scriabin symphonies and piano concerto , tchaikovsky 's first and sixth symphonies , as well as shorter works , beethoven 's first symphony , violin concerto and triple concerto , rimsky-korsakov 's scheherazade and his operas sadko and christmas eve , mussorgsky 's boris godunov and pictures at an exhibition , rachmaninoff 's second and third symphonies , the opera aleko and other compositions , glazunov 's fifth , sixth and seventh symphonies , and scores by grieg , mozart and others . based upon the evidence of his recordings , golovanov 's characteristic performance mode was full-blooded and nearly vehement in tone , with a powerful , almost overloaded sense of sonority , and extreme flexibility in matters of tempo , phrasing and dynamics .
in addition to audio recordings by golovanov , there is extant visual representation of his conducting style . possibly during the second world war , evidently intended as a morale booster , there was produced a film of golovanov conducting a group called the ussr state symphony orchestra in a performance of the tchaikovsky `` 1812 overture . `` as was the practice in the ussr , the tsarist anthem was replaced in the score with the chorus `` glory , glory to you , holy russia ! `` from glinka 's `` a life for the tsar . `` the film does not feature synchronous sound , and concerns itself primarily with various soviet functionaries , military figures and orthodox priests ( ! ) in the audience ; however , the short segments of golovanov conducting show an energetic but physically spare conducting style , one seemingly at odds with the sometimes extreme nature of his interpretations .
golovanov was also a composer ; his works include the opera `` princess yurata `` , a symphony and other orchestral works as well as choral music .

gibbs graduated from yale and johns hopkins in 1929 . he was offered a fellowship in neuropathology by stanley cobb , of harvard medical school . he studied epilepsy in the same laboratory as william g. lennox and erna leonhardt .
erna leonhardt was lennox 's technical co-worker and had come to boston as an immigrant from germany . [ 1 ] she married gibbs in 1930 and they formed a research team that would last a lifetime , publishing papers together over the next fifty-odd years .
the electroencephalograph was primitive in the early 1930s , having only one channel . in 1935 , gibbs asked albert grass ( an mit graduate ) to build a 3-channel eeg . grass built the machine in his father 's basement with the help of his brother . in the same year , erna and frederic gibbs travelled to europe to attend a conference and visit hans berger , the inventor of the eeg . [ 2 ] in 1944 , they moved to university of illinois school of medicine , and frederic gibbs was promoted to professor in the epilepsy clinic .
the gibbs published the book `` atlas of electroencephalography `` in 1941 , with a second edition in 1951 . their book valued the subjective and experienced eye of an electroencephalographer over objective mechanical or mathematical analysis . [ 3 ] frederic gibbs was jointly ( with william lennox ) awarded the albert lasker award for clinical medical research in 1951 .

manuel carlos prado y ugarteche ( april 21 , 1889 – august 15 , 1967 ) was a banker who served twice as president of peru . son of former president mariano ignacio prado , he was born in lima and served as the nation 's 50th ( 1939 - 1945 ) and 54th ( 1956 - 1962 ) president . his brother , leoncio prado gutiérrez , was a military hero who died in 1883 , six years before manuel prado was born .
as a young army officer , prado was a key player in the coup that overthrew peruvian president guillermo billinghurst in 1914 . he became president of the central reserve bank in 1934 .
manuel prado , a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family , reached the presidency of peru with the help of the left-wing alianza popular revolucionaria americana party . prado announced that `` one of the first acts of my government will be to declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties . ``
during prado 's second presidency ( 1956–1962 ) , the only significant proscribed party was the apra ( american popular revolutionary alliance ) , which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by president manuel odría . prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected congress a bill to legalize apra once again . the bill was later passed and the apra 's famed founder , víctor raúl haya de la torre , returned from foreign exile .
in foreign policy , prado – whose greatest pride was that as president in 1942 he made peru the first of the south american nations to break off relations with the axis powers– was expected to side firmly with the u.s . there is documentary evidence that shows that prado 's enthusiastic support of the deportation of peruvians of japanese descent to the united states during world war ii was motivated by a desire to rid peru of all of its japanese-descended residents—a charge which some historians have argued amounted to a campaign of ethnic cleansing .

degeirwàn was born in fieglitz near schücken . as an undergraduate , he earned a doctorate at göttingen , and then a master 's degree in 1881 and 1882 at the university of berlin , where he attained an ma in 1889 . in 1896 , he took a job in the neurology department at the st. louis hospital , where he remained until 1908 . after leaving the st. louis hospital in 1908 , he became a demonstrator in psychoacoustics and later a professor in neurological neurology and neurosurgery at the university of berlin .
degeirwàn 's work covered brain structure , distribution , structure of ganglia , and function . he served as director of the berlin pharmacopoeia from 1905 to 1907 , and served as vice-president of the st. louis hospital from 1910 to 1914 . he was president of the american psychological association from 1914 to 1916 , and from 1922 to 1924 he was its president . he served as director of the new york city hospital from 1929 to 1932 , and was appointed to the chair of the psychiatry department at the medical college of columbia university in 1934 . in 1936 he was awarded the albert einstein memorial prize in neurophysiology .

he was one of the first to observe that the first stages of life have a complex relationship to the development of brains . early stages of brain development were stable or stable , but in later stages , stages 2 and 3 of brain development show a more or less irregular pattern . he summarized these early stages of brain development and identified major phases of the brain during childhood : auditory ( affect ) , visual ( action ) , motor ( vision ) , and sensory ( memory ) stages.degeirwàn served as editor of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences from 1928 until 1948 , and the american journal of psychiatry from 1935 until 1950.degeirwàn earned the franklin institute of the advancement of medical science medal in 1935 .

= christoph b. neumann =
christoph wilhelm neumann ( 23 september 1877 – 10 may 1965 ) was a german-born scientist and sociologist .


== biography ==
christoph wilhelm neumann was born in stuttgart on 23 september 1877 and emigrated to the united states in 1912 . he was a music professor in stuttgart and became active in the social sciences in the us . he taught for 30 years at brown university . in 1919 he completed a doctorate at johns hopkins university .
he became professor of economics at the university of chicago from 1931-1948 , and from 1948 until his retirement in 1975 became dean of the graduate school of public administration .
in his first book ( 1946 ) he defended the contributions of labor theory in the theory of population sociology , later reopening this idea with his most influential book , the economic origins of population ( 1947 ) . this began the current trend in demographic and social sociology that economists claim is a response to the `` energy crisis `` of world war ii , a conflict in which technological modernization led to increased demand for the working class and an increase in the status of women and of racial minorities .


== work ==
neumann examined the role of the concentration of wages in industrial production , to determine how unemployment affected consumption .
neumann believed that the effects of technology could be exploited by the employing classes , and published studies that he hoped would be used as a lesson in urban sociology . in a 1941 article he wrote about the economic education of low-income children , he predicted that such courses would help lower-class children to develop an understanding of the values and values of competition . he did however draw a comparison with marxism , in that it taught children to think critically . for example , neumann predicted that marx 's criticism of the contradiction between proletariat 's economic interest in the production of surplus value and capitalist exploitation of labour would contribute to the emergence of a concept of `` laddism `` in the worker 's class consciousness that would inform future counter-revolutionary thinking .

neumann 's focus on wages was influential during the post-war `` third industrial revolution `` in which wages were a major political issue . following a revolution in 1947 for which neumann was best known , wages took a back seat for working-class resistance to cuts in state services . wages in germany and in other developed capitalist countries have since been on a steady upward trajectory . when it came to matters of wages , by the 1950s the human demand theory that neumann developed , similar to walter reed 's , had been widely applied in the development of neo-liberalism . neumann warned that the `` pace of technological advance has outstripped marx 's vision of a dialectical progression of technology that eventually transcends capitalism and arrives at socialism `` . during this period , neumann also began developing the notion of labor supply and demanded that society institute policies that would increase it , proposing the concept of `` socialized labor `` in a 1948 article .


== personal life ==
neumann married his wife , anna , in 1924 . they had five children , one of whom became a statistician . he was also a pianist , violinist and harpsichordist .

in a number of his books , hubbard describes various myths and legends that influenced his thinking . in the secret life of an aborigine he describes aboriginal `` ceremonial ecstasy `` as a means of manipulating their humanity , defining an enemy as either an enemy of the tribe or their creator . in the same book , he claims that the aborigine 's aboriginal name is maat . hubbard considered it a repugnant word that would vilify and dehumanise the aborigines and led him to retract the epithet . in the final chapters of his book , hubbard lists some of the reasons for rejecting the ethnic origins of aborigines , saying they are 'not good people. `` this is not the first time hubbard had used the word `` butcher `` , but his use of it makes it the most common the word has been used in australian public speech .
hubbard 's use of the word also triggered a backlash , and his use of it led to public protests .
in his autobiography , hubbard is said to have denied that he was a jew . hubbard 's daughter kristine also denied that hubbard was a member of any illegal party or organisation .

he studied engineering under wilhelm von liebig at the university of tübingen , where he made important discoveries in solid-state physics , especially in photographic calorimetry , and on the speed of electricity .
in the winter of 1864–65 he was inspector of mining engineering at metz , and as an assistant in the metallurgical institute ( siemens ) at braunschweig . in 1871–72 he was elected a member of the german academy of sciences and letters , and in 1877–78 a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences .
in 1879 erziehung and heinrich locher-wolff ( 1809–1887 ) were among the first in europe to see the possibility of a method for extracting platinum from meteorites . this lead to discoveries in the mineralogy of rare elements , and new studies on the possibility of producing platinum from fissile uranium ( of which germany is in a crisis ) and thorium ( of which no more than two countries have produced a period of history of this production ) .
in 1887 he was elected the director of the central institute for metallurgical research in the city of braunschweig , which had been established at that time to oversee this research . the institute , which still exists today , is among the leading research centers of the world .
erziehung died in braunschweig on 5 august 1915 .

= adolf korelitzky =
adolf korelitzky ( russian : бард барович мирликов , born nov. 21 , 1882 in artemivsk , german : [ koleːlɛlθʲɪvʲɪs ] ; june 11 , 1919 – april 3 , 1966 ) was a soviet–soviet physicist who worked on nuclear physics .
he studied physics and became a full professor in 1917 .
korelitzky was a strong supporter of the theory of relativity , studying its principles of governing the behaviour of particles and of regularities in elasticity . in 1903 , he was the first to prove the lorentz transformation ( then known as the lorentz transform ) for one of the fundamental particles , atomic hydrogen . two years later , he showed that the same transformation would not hold for all elementary particles , with a special `` incorrect `` case where one of the three observers were correct .
in 1905 , he developed a theory based on the lorentz transformation that could explain the structure of protons . theory was proven by august schrödinger in 1924 and was later popularized by robert a. millikan in the book quantum mechanics . the result has been called the `` most significant discovery `` in the history of physics.in the laboratory of his father in moscow , he developed the three-body problem and the klein–dahle problem , as well as the thin sheet paradox . in his subsequent research , he showed how to find three new quarks ( h+ , h+2 and h2+ ) by solving the differential equations of the schwinger–gerlach constant that produced them and his telegram on 3 june 1928 expressing his complete agreement with the standard model . according to the theory , the transition from h+ to h2+ was not discovered until 1939 by the argentine theoretical physicist alfredo rocha .
in 1941 , he developed the so-called dritsen fragment of the black hole and the schwarzschild fragment .
