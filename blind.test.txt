 = Julius Hühner =  
Julius Paul Abraham Hühner ( 10 December 1789 – 3 August 1854 ) was a German entomologist, one of the founders of the International Entomological Union and the Prussian Minister of Agriculture.  
 Hühner was born in Trennsdorf ( Galizienstum ), in the Rhineland, the son of a shipbuilder who had immigrated to Germany from France in 1739. He studied natural sciences in Berlin and Leipzig. In 1764, he was elected to the University of Heidelberg as an assistant professor of natural philosophy and botany. In 1774 he became a professor in the agricultural department. He was appointed first professor of botany in 1780 and from 1792 his successor was Karl Richter, who had become director of the University of Heidelberg's botanical garden. When the Dutch Dominion of the Rhine gained a buffer state in 1792 Hühner was appointed a member of the cabinet. In 1797, he was made minister of agriculture, in 1800 he was appointed first secretary of the senate and in 1804 a member of the Standing Committee on the constitution of the Prussian empire.  
 He was active as a writer and a public official in the estates of the diaspora of Heidelberg and in other German states. In 1804 Hühner joined the association Europaeischen Gesellschaft Leopold des Königlichen Lebens ( Foreign Cooperative Society of the Blue Cross Institutes ) and in 1809 was appointed its treasurer.

 = J. Augustin Poisson =  
Louis Augustin Poisson ( 2 December 1863 in Paris – 15 March 1927 in Paris ) was a French microbiologist. He is best known for his work on the role of oxidative phosphorylation in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and as a pioneer in the field of immunological cell biology.  
   
   
 == Life and education ==  
 Poisson was born on 2 December 1863 in Paris. He studied medicine at the École Normale Supérieure. His studies came to an end on 7 April 1892, when he was charged with `` participating in a [ French ] student movement '' that sought to undermine Louis Pasteur's theories of immunization. He began his doctoral studies in 1892 at the Pasteur Institute at the invitation of Friedrich Braun, the father of virologist Henry A. Braun. In 1894, Poisson joined Braun's group and developed his own theory of the interplay of factors in the self-organization of the cell.  
 Poisson first studied the role of oxidative phosphorylation in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. In 1888, he published a groundbreaking paper in which he postulated that oxidative phosphorylation requires addition of an amino acid sequence to its histone molecules in order to foster the growth and differentiation of cell nuclei.During the early 1890s, Poisson was an editor of the Revue physiologique and authored important articles on the immune system and cell biology. In 1904, he published an essay on phage infections, titled `` On the Phage Ulcer of Zaire ''. During World War I, he served as the Head of the Biochemical Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. In 1919, he was appointed Professor of Biology at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Poisson's wife, Louise Pierre Chatelain, was the daughter of military conscript Paul Buxpin Chatelain, and granddaughter of Pierre Émile Chatelain, an engineer who had worked at the Iron Works of Ghent. Their three children were Lucie ( 1918–2013 ), Claude François ( 1919–2013 ), and Victor Marie ( 1919–2013 ).

 Abetz was born in Karlsruhe, Saxony, and received his secondary school education in Stuttgart and Mannheim. He studied sciences, receiving his doctorate degree from the University of Wittenberg in 1841. He immediately began work at the Military Engineer's Institute of the Stettin branch of the Austro-Prussian Army, where he prepared and executed design plans for the construction of his first railway-and-piloting railway ( Abetz's namesake ).  
 In 1852 he became the director of the museum of natural history of the military academy, and devoted himself chiefly to the collection of marine and bird specimens.  
 Abetz was the first to notice the similarities between the juvenile and adult British Geese and the juvenile Siberian Geese. Abetz brought to these pieces of the skeleton which he had collected from the wars, and with them other pieces which had been recovered from foreign parts. The chief of these collections was deposited in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Wittenberg. These were exhibited in 1873 at the  
 Bavarian Exposition of the zoological and botanical productions of Europe, as was reported by Gustav Hermann. Other pieces which he kept on his own initiative and presented in this exhibition were : an episode of the Crimean War, ( 1877 ), two species of sand-flies, and several species of Parrot-fly ( Carbonopithecus brenneri ).  
 In 1881 Abetz sent a bundle of his own fossil specimens to the Geological Society of London in London. These were of fossilised wood beetles, Parrhema und Stenoermeilgräber. Abetz's most valuable deposit is held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Wittenberg. It contains 19 years'worth of vertebrates, some marine and some freshwater invertebrates.

 == Biography ==  
 Born in America, Cox attended Johns Hopkins University and then New York University, graduating with a BS in physical chemistry in 1947. He joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1951 as Professor of Physics, graduating with a PhD in 1962. He was also an adjunct faculty member and chair of the department of biochemistry.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Cox was the Dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Pennsylvania from 1982 to 1984, and Professor of Physiology, Immunology and Gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins University from 1985 to 1994. He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the World Health Organization in 1999. He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2002, and a corresponding member of the American Society for Molecular Biology in 2004. He retired in 1992.  
 He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Committee on Evolution of Genetics of the American Society of Human Genetics. He was a visiting professor at the University of Toronto, Dartmouth College, Oxford University, and Harvard University and was a visiting professor at the United Kingdom, Sweden, Korea, China, Argentina, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.  
 He was the recipient of the Ruth Neuhouser Fellowship from the National Science Foundation in the late 1980s.  
 He was a Science Advisor to the US Congress Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology and was a co-founder of the Science and Environmental Policy Project, a project sponsored by the National Science Foundation and others with the mission to increase public acceptance and acceptance of the theory of evolution, especially through improved planning for public policy. The project was disbanded when David Nutt's views about evolution made him believe it was impossible for the science community to take seriously the arguments for evolution and his support of the Earth Science teaching.  
 He also advised the DOE, DOD, and Navy on the adequacy of current funding for research on natural selection.  
   
   
 == Academic ==  
 In 1954, he received his PhD in Physical Chemistry at New York University under work for Dean Norbert Wiener. From 1955 to 1965, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. From 1963 to 1965, he was in the United Kingdom. From 1968 to 1976, he was a professor at Yale University and in 1975 at Columbia University in New York.  
 He was a founding member and the first president of the Molecular Biology Society and the CRG. Cox, as a taxonomist, was known for his work on organelle evolution. Cox is most notable for publishing his hypothesis that Fauna ( synonyms for type, species and subspecies of organisms ) evolved through natural selection, the process of converting ancestral materials to new forms by rapid mechanisms. He also worked to expand on other types of morphological variation, specifically within species, focusing primarily on species-specific differences.  
 Cox was credited with inspiring dozens of young scientists, and organizing more than 80 graduate students and researchers who became leaders in a generation of evolutionary biologists. Together, he and Max Kastner ( who went on to co-found CRG ) established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the largest ( $ 60,000,000 in 2018 ) and most active global conservation group working on supporting Africa and other biodiversity.

 = Arthur Augustus Story =  
Arthur Augustus Story ( 27 January 1845 – 28 October 1927 ) was a British economist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Charlton, Suffolk, the son of Simon Henry Story, the builder and his wife Margaret Ainslie Story. Arthur had three younger brothers : John, Benjamin, and William. His parents were of Irish heritage, and the family lived on the Quay between London and Harrogate. He was educated at John Keble's School, and at Christ Church, University of Cambridge. On his father's death in 1863, Story made his own way to Adelaide to help his father.  
 Arthur was educated at U.S. universities, and graduated from the University of Cambridge with a first class degree in 1874.  
 He became a lecturer in economics at the University of Sydney in 1877, taking advantage of the absence of salary deferments for lecturers.  
 Story held important positions in British government and had, as a senior clerk in the Ministry of War, a number of posts in the council of the new Commonwealth of Nations.  
 In 1899, Story went abroad to conduct an independent survey of the country's public finances. He began as professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, was appointed to a chair at Columbia University in 1898, and to that of deputy foreign minister at the Office of the United Nations in 1900.  
 In 1901 Story retired from a professorial position, and was engaged in spending the next four years among the mining communities of Papua, New Guinea. In 1905 he travelled to Japan for the first time, and began to consider a return to British service.  
   
   
 == Government  
 While working as head of the Australian Bank of Commerce in Tokyo, Story met Joseph Stiglitz. The two men published a paper in the British Economic Review ( May 1905 ) which supported a call for internationalisation of foreign exchange control.  
 This led Story to lead an independent bank as adviser to the Advisory Committee on War Loans ( the earlier body of Bank of England policymakers for the use of the Treasury ).He became Governor of the Bank of England in January 1906 and served until his death in 1927. In 1907 he visited the United States and Israel, and became a key adviser on national economic policies to Franklin D. Roosevelt.  
   
   
 == Pledges and claims ==  
 Arthur Augustus Story was a Conservative, and a Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire in the House of Commons in 1875-76. He was a supporter of the 1907 Treaty of Versailles and served on the London Economic and monetary committee.He was one of the founders of the Fair Trade Movement, a liberal trade organisation. He refused to accept his party's acceptance of the new fair trading order as coercive and had in 1922 a speech in the House of Commons saying : `` Labor, which has stood back, probably because of its high official bills, has come into the modern world, and... It has reached a place in society at which the consequences of its own inertia must be some of the most serious. ''  
 Story was an advocate of free trade, but is more familiarly known for his demands for pay and conditions for laborers. He proposed the following :  
   
 `` In every factory which undertakes the manufacture of clothes and bedding it shall pay a minimum and universal minimum of five shillings and five pence, for each worker, in all trades but those in which wages are specially fixed, the cost of each kind of work. ''  
 `` Every dresser shall be compensated for the labour of the male worker. There shall be no exception whatever to the wage clause. ''  
 `` There shall be no casual appointment without the consent of the owners ; and no casuality or discriminatory appointment without his consent. ''  
 `` Every house of mercantile trade shall give notice to all employees of wages fixed, after eight weeks notice shall have been given, of the years, months, weeks, and months of the work of the day and evening, of the hours and days of each week, of the hours and days of each fortnight, and of the hours and days of each week in the year. ''  
   
   
 == Major policy area ==  
 Arthur Augustus Story was critical of monopoly and the free-trade trade policy of the United Kingdom. He thought international trade had contributed to an unjust system, and compared that with that of Prussia.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Arthur Augustus Story donated £700 to the Committee on the Reform of the University of London when it was formed.

 = Charles-Louis Hanon =   
Charles-Louis Hanon ( 2 July 1819 – 19 March 1900 ) was a French piano pedagogue and composer . He is best known for his work The Virtuoso Pianist in 60 Exercises , which is still used today for modern piano teaching , but over the years the method has also faced criticisms . He was born in Renescure , France in 1819 , and died in Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1900 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Charles-Louis Hanon was born in northern France in the village of Renescure on July 2 , 1819 . Trained as an organist by a local teacher , it is not known if he received more advanced musical education . At age 27 , he moved a short distance east from Renescure to Boulogne-sur-Mer where he lived with his brother François who was also a musician .   
 Music was never the exclusive focus of Hanon 's life : he was also a devout Roman Catholic , a Third Order Franciscan and a member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul .   
 It is known from an 1869 article that Hanon was involved with a monastic order called the “ Brothers of the Christian Schools. ” Founded in the 17th century by Saint John Baptist de la Salle , the schools run by the order provide free instruction to poor children . One such school was established in Boulogne-sur-Mer in approximately 1815 by Léon de Chanlaire and Father Benoît-Agathon Haffreingue , free music instruction was offered there by 1830 . ( 1 )   
    
    
 == The Virtuoso Pianist ==   
 Piano students all over the world know of Hanon 's famous training exercises . Both Sergei Rachmaninoff and Josef Lhévinne claimed Hanon to be the secret of why the Russian piano school delivered an explosion of virtuosi in their time , for the Hanon exercises have been obligatory for a long time throughout Russian conservatories ; there were special examinations at which one had to know all exercises by heart , to be played in all keys at high speed .   
 Although most respected pedagogues and pianists acknowledge the value of Hanon 's exercises , they have their detractors . Some critics have questioned the merits of the independent finger technique which the exercises seek to cultivate , with some pedagogues , such as Abby Whiteside , considering them to be actively harmful .   
 It has become a custom in some music schools to hold a Hanon Marathon , in which the exercises are played competitively , the Church Street School for Music and Art being the first to have coined the term and hold the event .   
    
    
 == Other works and derivatives ==   
 Hanon also wrote 50 instructional pieces , Méthode Élémentaire de Piano , and a collection of 50 Ecclesiastical Chants .   
 Charles Nunzio wrote Hanon for Accordion , a two-volume set of exercises for piano accordion based on a similar philosophy , which has recently been reissued in an updated edition .   
 A Hanon for guitar and bass have also been written.An abbreviated , 60 second , version exists .

 == Biography ==

 = Giuseppe Ricciotti =   
Giuseppe Ricciotti ( Rome , 1890 – 1964 ) was an Italian canon regular , Biblical scholar and archeologist . He is famous mainly for his book The Life of Christ edited in 1941 and reedited and reprinted several times .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Ricciotti was born in Rome on 27 February 1890 . In 1905 he entered the novitiate of the Roman Catholic religious order of the Canons Regular of the Lateran , taking religious vows the following year . After his seminary studies and completing mandatory military service , he was ordained as a priest in 1913 . After ordination , Ricciotti continued his studies at the University of Rome , where he took courses in both philosophy and theology . At the same time he did coursework at the Pontifical Biblical Institute .   
 During World War I he was required to interrupt his studies and to perform military service , during which time he served as a military chaplain , volunteering for service at the front lines , and was afterwards awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor for his service in the trenches , where he was seriously wounded . Because of this experience , he came to oppose any kind of war .   
 After the war , Ricciotti resumed his studies and graduated in 1919 with a degree in Biblical Studies . From 1924 onwards , he taught Hebrew literature at the University of Rome . He also taught similar courses briefly at the University of Genoa and at the University of Bari , where he taught from 1935 to 1960 . In addition to this , Ricciotti set up and directed a small seminary in Liguria .   
 In 1935 he was appointed Procurator General of his religious congregation . During World War II , due to his office he was able to give refuge to many refugees at the congregation 's motherhouse at the Basilica of St. Peter in Chains . During this period , he also served as a consultant to the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy . He held this position for his congregation until 1946 , when he was named as the Abbot of Gubbio .   
 Giuseppe Ricciotti died in Rome on 22 January 1964 .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Ricciotti 's first important work is Storia d'Israele ( English : History of Israel ) , published in 1932 . In 1932 he also published Bibbia e non Bibbia ( English : Bible and not Bible ) where he supported the need to apply the Higher criticism to the study of the Bible , to be based on the original texts and not on the Latin Vulgate . In 1934 Ricciotti took a stand against the increasing antisemitism publishing the translations in Italian of sermons of Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber in favour of the Hebrews.The period in which he worked was one of deep suspicion of Biblical Studies in Italy . As a result , Ricciotti was partially involved in the late stages of the Modernist crisis . He was attacked , along with his friend Ernesto Buonaiuti , by the most conservative Catholic wing . Differently from Buonaiuti , his positions were finally judged not to be modernist , and he accepted criticism by the Pontifical Biblical Commission to some of his works .   
 His masterpiece is Vita di Gesù Cristo ( English : Life of Jesus Christ ) , edited in 1941 and published many times . The scholar Nicolotti writes : `` His works on biblical texts , of a rather conservative character , show a solid historical and philological training , not at all alien to the contemporary acquisitions of the critic . '' Giuseppe Ricciotti also wrote : La Bibbia e le scoperte moderne ( English : The Bible and Modern Discoveries ) , 1957 , and L'imperatore Giuliano l'Apostata secondo i documenti ( English : Julian the Apostate ) , 1958 . Additionally , he edited a new translation into Italian of the Bible from the original texts .

 He published more than 300 papers, between 1885 and 1918, on various aspects of music theory. Some of the major contributions he made to the field were `` L'Église des industriels chrétiens '' ( 1917 ), `` Éditions de la musique et de la populaire '' ( 1920 ), and `` Géométrie d'autographie '' ( 1916 ), in which he presented his view of the scientific method. With William Eliot, he was a leading British authority on modern musical psychology.  
 He contributed the controversial Synopsis of Theory, which has been widely criticized as a synthesis of pre- and post-modern doctrines.  
 He published a volume of essays entitled Art and Music ( 1931 ).  
 He was made an OBE in 1936.

 = Edgar Chance =   
Edgar Percival Chance ( 1881–1955 ) was a British businessman , ornithologist and oologist who amassed a collection of 25,000 birds ' eggs . He is noted for his pioneering studies on the parasitic breeding behaviour of the common cuckoo ( Cuculus canorus ) .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Chance was born at Edgbaston , in the city of Birmingham , the son of Alexander Macomb Chance and Florence Mercer . Chance 's fraternal grandmother was Cornelia de Peyster , whose ancestors were Dutch and Huguenot settlers in British North America and Loyalist to the Crown . He was educated at Trinity College , Cambridge . He was a wealthy businessman and industrialist who managed the family chemicals business , Chance and Hunt , based in Oldbury , West Midlands , which provided chemicals to Chance Brothers , the famous glassmakers based in Smethwick , Birmingham , between the first and second world wars . He was an egg-collector who became fascinated by cuckoos and made intensive studies of the common cuckoo , in the course of which he wrote two books about the species as well as producing a film . The film , The Cuckoo 's Secret , was shot at Pound Green Common in Worcestershire , showing for the first time that female cuckoos lay their eggs directly into the nests of their hosts , rather than laying them on the ground and placing them in the nests with their bills as was previously widely believed . He also achieved a world record for collecting the most eggs – 25 – from a single female cuckoo in the course of one breeding season ( 1922 ) .Chance was a member of the British Ornithologists ' Union – from which his egg collecting eventually resulted in his expulsion – and served on the Council of the British Oological Association . He named his daughter Cardamine , alluding to the scientific name of the cuckoo flower Cardamine pratensis .   
 Professor Nick Davies of Cambridge University has described Chance as one of his all time heroes and featured Chance 's contribution to science in his book Cuckoo.Chance 's large egg collection , which includes the eggs of the cuckoo filmed at Pound Green Common , is held at the Natural History Museum at Tring.Edgar Chance 's elder brother Kenneth Macomb Chance , Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1948 and founder of British Industrial Plastics , was also a keen egg-collector , forming between 1925 and 1938 a complete collection of Warwickshire birds ' eggs which is now in the possession of his grandson.Chance died at his home , age 74 , on 24 October 1955 .

Woodrow studied chemistry at Cornell University and the Johns Hopkins University, receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1940. He was president of the American Physical Society from 1941 to 1950. From 1955 to 1959, Woodrow was president of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, a post he held until his death in 1992.  
 He is remembered for his work on radioisotopes, particularly the atomic bomb. In 1946 he invented a semiconductor transistor whose switching capacity was increased by combining the long-wavelength element of the fluorine salt with carbon in an electron-positron transition. This became the first use of an oxide semiconductor to improve electrical conductivity in electronics.  
 Woodrow was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1945 and awarded its Medal of Freedom in 1950.Woodrow married Ella Neal during a laboratory expedition in 1954.

 == Biography ==  
 Samuel Clarke was the son of Samuel Clarke of Bermondsey ( 1813–1874 ) and Elizabeth ( 1836–1914 ). He was educated at St Andrews and Uppingham School before graduating with first class honours in mathematics in 1840 and 1841. There he practised for a few years.  
   
   
 === Journal ===  
 On receiving his degree he published papers on three subjects, namely `` On the Continuous Power of Differential and Integral expressions, '' `` On the Heat of Some Calculation, '' and `` On the Fourier series of the Common Vector ''. One of these papers was first published by Gordon Simpson in the Philosophical Magazine, he later edited the paper, with Herbert Bates, In his first publication in 1848 he summarised his latest progress with a re-examination of the first four papers published in 1845. In the second published, in 1850, he presented his results in connection with the `` The Fundamental Calculus of Diffraction ''. Clarke in his paper on `` The heat of some calculus of heat '' talked of the quasi-photographic heat curve ; in 1854 he turned his attention to the spectral line of an arbitrary theta ray, and concluded that, although very much less light is produced by a particular frequency, the difference between the two forms and the rest of the spectrum results in a distinctive characteristic spectral line.

 = Bernard Pinaud =  
Bernard François Henri-Pinaud ( 20 February 1899 – 28 June 1991 ) was a French meteorologist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Pinaud was born in Paris, France, to a family of legal professionals. His mother was a lawyer, while his father was a businessman. He attended the École Polytechnique and graduated from the École Polytechnique in 1922. In 1925 he started working at the Observatory de France in Toulouse, and later began work at the Meteorological Office of Paris. Pinaud joined the French meteorological organization the French National Observatory and was the director of this organization until his death in 1992.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Pinaud was the second of four brothers. He was a highly respected meteorologist and showed great commitment to scientific research. He made important contributions in a number of categories, among which were helioclines, atmospheric physics and fluid mechanics. On 26 September 1952, Pinaud published the first detailed scientific report on the prognostic theory of rings, described a greenhouse effect, and a few days later the first comet was observed. In 1953, he published the first scientific description of the ozone layer. In 1954, he proposed a model of stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing, developed an idea for the formation of the 18th century rift valley, and proposed a method for the effective resolution of ground-based optical instruments.  
 He published the first in 1961 of a model for hypercyclonic circulation ( a model developed in the 1950s of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ). He and his collaborators also devised mathematical models of convection and thawing, and he proposed the existence of clouds in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and that sea level is dependent on the water column.  
 He was also the first to propose the umbra of the heliosphere as a barrier for the water flow that would reduce the level of the upper atmosphere by over 30 m, to which several models have been applied in the literature.  
 The young Pinaud kept an interest in history, a passion that filled him with new ideas. He gave many lectures in history, including his seminal 1970 article, `` Sahara - archaeology and science '', which gave the first version of the section on `` Sahara as archaeology and science '' ( ed. by François T. Georges ). Among his most popular books was Le texte vat, ( Encyclopedia of Meteorology, Paris : Lagardère & Mouton, 1971 ), an autobiography of Marcel Valéry, which he published in 1986, and Elle au desert : a memoir, ( 2009 ), a collaboration with the author Henri Poitou, which described his own career as an author and photographer. His most famous research work, Elle et la française : ou Commentaire sur les sources de la science, ( Paris : Editions du CNRS, 1963 ), presents his methods for uncovering the methodologies of atmospheric scientists.  
 In 1950 he received the Order of the Iron Crown of the French Republic, as a result of his work on the Le Bicêtre radiation theory.

 == Life ==   
 Nannette was the sixth child of the organ and piano maker Johann Andreas Stein in Augsburg ( 1728–1792 ) and his wife Maria Regina Stein née Burkhart . Early on , she received piano lessons from her father , who was influenced by his friend Ignaz von Beecke . In Augsburg Nannette Stein played piano at concerts , sometimes with her friend Nanette von Schaden . In 1787 she sang `` some minor arias '' in a concert . She had to give up singing later for health reasons . After her father 's death on 29 February 1792 , she continued the piano workshop independently .   
 In 1793 she married the musician Johann Andreas Streicher ( 1761–1833 ) and moved with him to Vienna in 1794 . She took over her father 's business , initially with her younger brother Matthias Andreas Stein ( 1776-1842 ) , and after 1802 continued under her name ( Nannette Streicher née Stein ) . With the support of her husband and from 1824 to 1825 with their son , Johann Baptist ( 1796–1871 ) as a partner , the business became an important piano manufacturer . Johann Baptist Streicher was the sole owner of the factory , which under his leadership acquired many patents and became world famous . The company was sold in 1896 to the brothers Stingl .   
 Nannette Streicher and Andreas were not only piano makers . The concerts she organised were an important contribution to Viennese musical life , first in her apartment , then from 1812 in a piano salon she organized , which offered young artists welcome opportunities for performance . The friends and customers of the couple included Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe .   
 Nannette Streicher sometimes played in private before the friends and visitors of the music circle , sometimes together with her daughter Sophie ( 1797–1840 ) , an equally gifted piano player . Her circle included many great musicians of Vienna , and her friendship with Beethoven is documented in more than sixty letters , in which the composer sought advice and assistance in household and educational questions , after he was granted custody of his nephew Karl .   
 Nanette Streicher died on 16 January 1833 after two months of illness .

 Born in Cleveland , Ohio , Shlaer received a BS in Mathematics in 1960 from Stanford University and started a graduate study at the Australian National University .   
 At Stanford Shlaer had started programming in Fortran and assembler . In 1965 she started as a software engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory . In 1977 she became project manager in software development at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , where she guided the development of a new Integrated Control System for the Bay Area Rapid Transit System.At Lawrence Berkeley , Laboratory Shlaer met Stephen J. Mellor , with whom she developed the Shlaer–Mellor method for software development . In 1985 together they founded the software development firm Project Technology Inc. Shlaer was also a Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery .

 === Software engineering ===   
 Shlaer started her software engineering career at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a programmer . She designed and implemented an operating system to operate an electron accelerator to work in real time , and this project became her masterpiece.At Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , she led a team of software developers to build a new control system for the subway of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . The existing control system software was considered impossible to continue using , making replacement necessary . Working with Steve Mellor , they replaced the original Fortran and assembly language code with new code , going from seventy thousand lines to two thousand . This analysis has since been called `` legendary '' .   
    
    
 === Shlaer–Mellor method ===   
    
 In the developing of a new control system for the Bay Area Rapid Transit , Shlaer and Mellor sought to regulate mechanisms of software development and began to design new methods of project management . This resulted in the development of the Shlaer–Mellor method , which in the new millennium has evolved into Executable UML .

 = Guillaume Daniel Delprat =   
Guillaume Daniel Delprat CBE ( 1 September 1856 – 15 March 1937 ) was a Dutch-Australian metallurgist , mining engineer , and businessman . He was a developer of the froth flotation process for separating minerals.Delprat was born in Delft , the Netherlands , son of Major General Felix Albert Theodore Delprat ( 1812–1888 ) , later minister of war , and his wife Elisabeth Francina , née van Santen Kolff .   
 Delprat attended a high school in Amsterdam and later became an apprentice engineer on the Tay Bridge in Scotland . He attended science classes in Newport-on-Tay and learned calculus from his father by post . On returning to the Netherlands , he is said to have acted as assistant to Johannes Diderik van der Waals , physics professor at the University of Amsterdam . From 1879 to 1882 , Delprat worked in Spain at the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Mines.In 1898 , chairman E. N. Wigg of Broken Hill Proprietary invited Delprat to Australia to become Assistant General Manager of BHP . He moved there with his wife and children . On 1 April 1899 , he was promoted to General Manager , a position he held until 1921 . At BHP , he pioneered the froth flotation process for refining sulphide ore. Delprat foresaw the exhaustion of BHP 's mine at Broken Hill , and pushed for moving the company 's smelters to Port Pirie ; also construction of the Iron Knob railways . He shifted BHP from silver and lead mining to zinc and sulphur production . These moves were the basis of BHP 's later success.Delprat also pushed construction of the BHP steelworks at Newcastle , New South Wales . The contract was signed on 24 September 1912 and the steelworks were opened by Governor-General Novar on 2 June 1915 . For Delprat 's visionary judgement in the project he was made a CBE.In 1935 Delprat was the first recipient of the medal of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy .

 = Thorvald Vetter =  
Thorvald Vetter ( May 14, 1865 – July 9, 1948 ) was a Norwegian banker, politician, and writer.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Born in Aarborg, Norway, Vetter was the son of court registrar Valdemar Vetter and his wife Sigrid, née Berg. He was educated at Aarborg's High School and was subsequently taught at the secondary school where he was rector from 1900 until his death. He was an expert on the annals of the city and mayor of Aarborg during the 1850s and 1860s.As an accountant and tax advisor, Vetter was active in the various departments of government, both internal and external, and he published many books. He also attended lectures and seminars, although he refused to acknowledge them as genuine public lectures. The latter was a violation of Norwegian law, and Vetter was quickly arrested.  
   
   
 == Political career ==  
 Vetter's career as a political leader began when his father was arrested in 1852 and forced to flee to the United States in 1853. In 1855, he was named a state director of various companies ( choristers ), and he served as a secretary to the minister of economic affairs at that time. In 1860, he was appointed chairman of the Electoral Committee, the highest municipal office, and the Danish foreign minister. He held this office until 1870, and was rewarded with the title of prince-prefect. Vetter also served as president of the Norwegian Arbitration Commission and from 1872, as chairman of the Norwegian Bankers'Association.  
   
   
 == Other activities ==  
 During his long career, Vetter wrote a few books of political speculation and political dogmatism. In 1830, he wrote an essay on the importance of the conflict with Germany over taxation to broaden the use of his ideas. In 1840, he commented on Denmark's formation of a Commonwealth. In 1848, he criticized the Met Office's method of counting the stars on the night sky, and in the same year he voted against a law to introduce vaccination against smallpox. His views on the problem of tectonics and meteorology influenced physicists such as Jacob Grotius. In 1857, he wrote On the Doctrine of Solids ( nr. 15 ), a review of David Hume's works ; the subsequent article in French attracted many of Vetter's readers. On the geometry of the Earth, based on the example of Quaternions, he is generally cited.Vetter was a member of the Keldysh Club, a Norwegian group of international economists and geologists. In 1874, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a member of the Geological Society of Copenhagen, a member of the Royal Norwegian Academy of Sciences, and a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.  
   
   
 == Political writings ==  
 The several books written by Vetter contain lengthy critiques of both the state and individual government of Norway, as well as a discussion of the political system in general. These writings are considered to be his finest works and in each case, they have earned him important political prizes. The only published collection of his political writings, entitled Sources of Original Works ( Vetter ), was published in 1990 by the University of St Andrews and distributed by Józef Stąbżeni.

Julia Barlow Platt ( 14 September 1857 , in San Francisco – 1935 ) was an American embryologist , politician and mayor .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Julia Platt received her undergraduate degree from the University of Vermont before moving to Cambridge to perform research at the Harvard Annex in 1887 . During her time at Harvard , she challenged the anti-coeducational policies in place . In 1889 , she left Harvard to take courses and do research at Woods Hole , Clark University , the University of Chicago , Bryn Mawr , the University of Freiberg , the Naples Zoological Station , and the University of Munich . She obtained her doctorate at Freiburg in 1898 . She investigated embryogenesis , in particular the head development , from studying sharks and salamanders . Her most notable contribution to the field was her demonstration that neural crest cells formed the jaw cartilage and tooth dentine in Necturus maculosus ( mudpuppy embryos ) , but her work was not believed by her contemporaries . Her claim went counter to the belief that only mesoderm could form bones and cartilage . Her hypothesis of the neural crest origin of the cranial skeleton gained acceptance only some 50 years later when confirmed by Sven Hörstadius and Sven Sellman.Unable to obtain a doctoral degree from Radcliffe or secure a university position , she said `` if I can not obtain the work I wish , then I must take up with the next best '' and then became active in politics , including tearing down a fence to give the public access to the beach at Lover 's Point in Pacific Grove , California . In 1931 , at the age of 74 , she became mayor of Pacific Grove , California . According to Steve Palumbi and Carolyn Sotka , her prescient pioneering setting up of a marine protected area was crucial to the recovery of the sea otter .

 = Josias Müller =  
Josias Müller ( March 15, 1836 – December 25, 1918 ) was a German physiologist and crystallographer.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Müller was born in Berlin, and studied philosophy at the University of Jena, receiving his doctorate in 1859. In 1860 he became professor of physical chemistry at the University of Würzburg, and remained there until 1873. He was later appointed director of the school of mineralogy at the University of Berlin. He became an expert on the crystallography of crystals, focusing particularly on that of the polyaromatic crystals of the mineral zeolite. In this work, he introduced three of the crystal patterns with the number's sign ( Müller's 3 ), which appeared in later centuries as distinct shapes known as geometricumiometric decoinomer. The three decoinomeric patterns became well known in the crystallographic literature, both in Germany and abroad.  
 From 1869 to 1872 he was an assistant at the laboratory of Emil Pestalozzi at the University of Pavia in Italy, and from 1873 to 1884 at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed professor of physics and mathematics. From 1886 to 1889 he was at the Imperial Chemical Exhibition in Copenhagen, and became the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Pavia. In 1894 he published his Discours sur l'irraser des crystals d'ambrage ( Observations on the Irradiation of the Crystals ) ; the works that followed appeared posthumously. He was the father of Professor Ferdinand Müller.  
 Müller was, like his friend Jacob Ewald, a popular naturalist, musician, and a writer on the history of medicine. He is mentioned in many sources in connection with the historical interpretation of Mesozoic fossils ( Hermann von Hahn, 1912, 1978 ) ; his chemical researches, both in nature and in analytical chemistry, are the subject of an extensive treatise by Leopold Stein ( 1888 ), Die Studien des Magisteliums und dem Darstellungslehre ( `` On the Standard of Prehistoric Chemistry '' ) ( in three parts, Vol. I and 2 ; vol. III and 4 ; volumes 3 and 5 ).The waters Müller is known to have examined, the waves which he measured, and other facts are in the works of George Penney ( 1911 ) and William Alvan Tait ( 1913 ). The results published by Tait in 1927. referred to the waters encountered in Copenhagen in 1868 during the two-day excursion in 1868–68 and 1869–70.

 = William Lutwiniak =   
William Lutwiniak ( November 24 , 1919 – January 24 , 1992 ) was an American crossword constructor who was also known for his work as a cryptologist with the National Security Agency . He composed a total of 8,413 puzzles ; his first five thousand were composed between 1965 and 1985 , as a hobby .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Lutwiniak was born in Jersey City , New Jersey . Lutwiniak began solving crosswords when he was 12 , and sold his first puzzle to the New York Herald-Tribune when he was 15 ; he later considered that this puzzle had been `` a bit prophetic '' because it contained the word `` CRYPTOGRAPHICAL '' . When he was 16 , he won a subscription to the journal of the American Cryptogram Association and also joined the National Puzzlers ' League with the nom `` Live Devil '' . Over the five years that followed , he was a regular participant in the ACA 's activities , which brought him to the attention of William Friedman ; Friedman invited him to pursue advanced training in cryptography , and then to join the Signal Intelligence Service , which Lutwiniak did on February 1 , 1941 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Lutwiniak worked at Arlington Hall under Solomon Kullback until the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor , at which point he became concerned that he would be drafted , so he went to the Munitions Building and asked Colonel Harold Hayes for advice ; Hayes told him to go to a particular recruiting station and enlist . Lutwiniak did so , and was immediately assigned to work under Harold Hayes at the Munitions Building ; when he returned , Hayes promoted him to sergeant so that he could skip basic training . By the following October , he had been promoted from staff sergeant to technical sergeant.During the war , Lutwiniak stopped creating and solving crosswords `` because things were serious '' . In the mid-1960s , however , he found a Margaret Farrar crossword in a copy of The New York Times , and discovered that he was not able to solve it as easily as he had expected ; he subsequently began selling crosswords to her . One of his early puzzles , which used cryptic crossword-style cluing such as `` center of gravity '' for `` AVI '' and `` fourth of July '' for `` Y '' , was so controversial ( creating , in Lutwiniak 's words , a 'big uproar ' ) that the newspaper had to subsequently print an explanation of what the clues meant.In 1961 , he headed the NSA 's A5 unit , which specialized in Soviet codes . Later , he became the publisher of Cryptolog , one of the NSA 's internal magazines , to which he also contributed articles and puzzles.In 1985 , he joined The Washington Post as crossword co-editor for their Sunday magazine , and became more involved in crossword culture ; in 1987 , he attended a Stanley Newman-run crossword tournament in Baltimore , and created a 15-by-15 puzzle on stage , in 15 minutes , based on suggestions from the audience .   
    
    
 == Awards and honors ==   
 Upon retiring from the National Security Agency in 1981 , Lutwiniak was awarded the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement.In 1991 , CROSSW RD Magazine named him Crossword Puzzle Person of the Year .

 = Hermann Pokorny =   
Hermann Pokorny ( Kroměříž , Austro-Hungarian Empire , 1882–1960 , Budapest , Hungary ) was a World War I Austro-Hungarian Army cryptologist whose work with Russian ciphers contributed substantially to Central Powers victories over Russia . He was a member of the Hungarian Order of Vitéz .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Pokorny was born in Moravia into a German-speaking family . His father was the postmaster of Kroměříž . A cousin was Major Franciszek Pokorny , a Polish Army officer who after World War I headed the Polish General Staff 's Cipher Bureau . In 1900 Herman Pokorny joined the k.u.k . Austro-Hungarian Army . By 1918 , when the Austro-Hungarian Empire fell , he was a lieutenant colonel .   
 During World War I , Pokorny , as a cryptologist in the rank of major , headed the Austro-Hungarian General Staff 's Russian-Cipher Bureau . He showed great ability in decrypting Russian enciphered military messages that were broadcast by radio in 1914–17 . He recognized that the Russian cryptographers had reduced the 35-letter Russian alphabet to 24 letters , while doubling the 11 missing letters to some of the other 24 letters . His break into the Russian military cipher system enabled Austro-Hungarian and German forces to act in advance of impending Russian maneuvers , thus contributing substantially to Central Powers victories over the Russians . He is mentioned in Soviet Marshal Boris Shaposhnikov 's famous book , Мозг армии ( The Brain of the Army , 1929 ) . For his services to cryptology , Pokorny was decorated with the Large Military Merit Medal with Swords in 1918 . Founded on April 1 , 1916 , this honour was intended for the `` highest especially praiseworthy recognition '' and was awarded only 30 times . 28 of its recipients were officers of general 's rank ; the other two were the naval aviator Gottfried von Banfield ( 1916 ) and Pokorny himself .   
 After World War I , as a German-language native speaker , Pokorny did not request Czechoslovak or Austrian citizenship because he was not welcome in Czechoslovakia on account of his German roots nor in Austria because he had been born on Czech soil . Accordingly , in 1918 he joined the Hungarian Army and made his new life as a Hungarian citizen . He was promoted to colonel in 1925 and retired in 1935 in the rank of major general .   
 During World War II , he was not called up for military service . After the Soviet Red Army captured Budapest in 1945 , he volunteered to support Hungary 's reconstruction . He worked for the Foreign Ministry ( 1945–49 ) . He went into his final retirement as a general , and died in Budapest in 1960 .

Leopoldina Georgievna Tavka ( Russian : Владима Леочанович Научка ) ( April 9, 1909 – December 2, 1995 ) was a Soviet pianist, music educator and the author of sixteen books.  
 Tavka was born in Moscow, and began her musical education there when she was 14. After earning a master's degree in 1929, she relocated to Canada, where she studied with Julien Folse. Later that year, she married British composer and pianist John Hammond, the father of the two pianists she would marry in 1951. Tavka returned to Moscow, to teach music to children in the Soviet Union until she was fired in 1945 after many comments against political change. Her final note of students was from Albert Einstein, who was a member of the Communist Party and was thus dismissed as a member of the `` tyrants ''. Tavka lived in the United States until her death in 1995.  
 Tavka taught piano and vocal history to several of her students, including Norbert Wiener, a student of her at the Victoria University of London. Tavka wrote to Einstein, urging him to join the Communist Party, and she wrote to him in 1952. However, she then left the Communist Party and was later criticized by the Communist Party, when her friend Mira Schoenberg took the position of Secretary. There, she lectured on Soviet music and culture. She taught opera, chamber music, voice and dance at the Moscow Conservatory in the early 1940s, before teaching voice, music and dance to Catherine Trenberth, whom she had met during a personal tour of Europe. In 1949, she began teaching music composition at Saint Petersburg Conservatory. There, she founded the journal VRE : Vision of Russian Music. She also served as the second President of the Music Society of South Asia, and received a number of awards for this.  
 On June 17, 1955, Tavka died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after experiencing a pulmonary embolism and being pronounced dead on the scene.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Her mother died when Tavka was six years old. In 1929, Tavka and her first husband, John Hammond, were evicted from their apartment in Moscow. Tavka, who was not Jewish, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household and began singing to protest the changes under Yeltsin. Her love for music was strong enough to encourage her to attend the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Anna Salomoïte-Avramov, who was also a member of the Communist Party. Although Tavka had mixed feelings about Salomoïte-Avramov's love for music, Tavka and Salomoïte-Avramov had an open-minded marriage that included the exchange of works. She became known as The `` actress in the cottage '', and when Salomoïte-Avramov visited Tavka in the US, Tavka gave her poems and stories, and when she heard Salomoïte-Avramov singing in Vienna in 1957, Tavka recorded her short take on one of Salomoïte-Avramov's songs.

 In 1873 Schultze published his doctoral dissertation. This paper noted that for the bromide minerals polyisopropylamine and polyisopropylamine-siialite have different basic mineralogical and crystallographic structures ; in addition, Schultze used a very new crystallographic technique, an electrostatic press, to compress and isolate the silica minerals, and subsequently crystallize the element.  
 Schultze's work is highly influential on other chemists, particularly chemist Karl Friedrich Gottlieb Jentzsch.

 = William Bonner =  
William Bonner ( 29 August 1836 – 20 November 1918 ) was an English agricultural economist and conservationist. Bonner's experimental results for describing the occurrence of `` species adapted to an ecological niche '' were important for application to future researches in organic development.  
 Bonner was the author of the 1951 work on eucalyptus trees in Australia.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was the eldest son of the coalmaster in Bath, and daughter of William and his wife, Margaret ( née Leach ). He was educated at Christ's School, Farnborough, and graduated in 1876 with an MA. He then took time off to take up a position with one of the Weymouth Nurseries. He then moved on to Barnet in 1881, becoming a barrister and continued his career as a farmer and nurseryman.  
 He set up an artificial nursery and, at the recommendation of Thomas Johnson, soon afterwards became Director of the Beesbury Works, being superintendent in 1889-90, and for many years managing director. In 1904, at the suggestion of Sir Adrian White of Great Grimsby, and assisted by John K. Humphrey, who then had a reputation as a forester, he had the gardens at the Beesbury Works integrated into a large but divided central area of public property. The main bulk of his holdings ( Derry Terrace, Gillon Mound, and Beesbury Pines ) was bought by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, in 1903, but in 1905 this land was included as the Beesbury estate, and the built-up part of this estate with an east-west road and junction were held by the Prüfburg Agricultural Society, and Bonner enjoyed full localisation, thus making more space for his ideas.  
 Bonner also inherited from his father the farm of Sara Barton, in Hackney, in the parish of Downe, where he built up the `` Mountain Estate '', and whose huts in which he developed his farm laboratory were brought back in 1949 to raise funds for Bantun's Day.Bonner became a trustee in the Bantun Foundation in 1910, a direct predecessor to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Sergei Zhuravlevich Gaytsev ( Russian : Ремилий Дмириевич Николаевич Корсьевич, Russian : Лерисович Дмириевич Корсьевич ; 5 April 1879 – 20 August 1946 ) was a Soviet biochemist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Sergei Gaytsev was born in Kharkiv, the son of Sergei Ivanovich Gaytsev, a mathematical physicist. After graduating from the Kiev State University, he earned his doctorate at Moscow University in 1912. He became the director of the Moscow State Physiological Institute ( 1933 ).  
 In 1920, with Anatoly S. Zimin, he developed a method to determine serum haemoglobin concentration by extracting the haemoglobin from water. It was the first biological blood test ( in blood tests or platelets ) to work completely without the use of a pregnant woman's blood and without the presence of thrombin. This invention was later supplemented by developing on high-affinity dyeing reagents for the detection of blood pigments and by using the invention of the chartrometer, for measuring serum haemoglobin and erythrocyte bilirubin.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 In 1922, Gaytsev was among the first to devise and use an enzymatic assay of enzyme concentrations to evaluate the alpha-helical acid levels of alpha-hemoglobin.He was among the first to develop methods for determining the blood levels of prothrombin by dissection of isolated liver contents. The method, implemented in 1922, provided additional insight into the clinical use of the antihypertensive-like medication statins.  
 In the early 1930s, Gaytsev developed the Gaytsev test for the test for platelet therapy based on the discovery of a new serum fragment derived from an infected lesion of the prostate gland.

 == L'incrédulité sçavante et la crédulité ignorante ==   
 L'incrédulité sçavante et la crédulité ignorante : au sujet des au sujet des magiciens et des sorciers ( 1671 ) was a reply to Gabriel Naudé 's Apologie pour tous les grands personnages , qui ont été faussement soupçonnés de magie . This work argues against both freethought and popular misconceptions.It cites the author 's personal experience during a witch-hunt in Burgundy in 1648/9 . It also references a 1670 interview with a woman accused of sorcery and witchcraft . Chevanes quotes De civitate Dei book 15 on demonology.It was addressed to the Parlement of Dijon , and was written largely from a legalistic point of view , though with lengthy digressions , for example on astrology . Lynn Thorndike suggests that its title may derive from the English anti-sceptical work On Credulity and Incredulity in Things natural , civil and divine ( 1668 ) by Méric Casaubon The appearance of this work has been noted as a milestone for the French judicial attitude ; it asserted that there were witches , but few of them.The work also moves to a general conclusion on the occult , namely that while it should be avoided for reasons already given by the Church Fathers , its practitioners should not be executed .

Joseph Adna Hill ( 1860–1938 ) was an American statistician , born at Stewartstown , New Hampshire . Hill was descended from `` an elite , old-line New England family , '' and attended many well-regarded educational institutions : after graduating from Phillips Exeter he attended Harvard University , graduating in 1885 , and completed his graduate studies at the University of Halle ( Ph.D. ) in 1892 . He published The English Income Tax with Special Reference to Administration and Method of Assessment ( 1899 ) .   
 In 1899 he took on statistical work for the United States Census Bureau , of which he became chief statistician in 1909 . In this connection he had charge of census reports on child labor , illiteracy , marriage and divorce , women at work , and a report for the Immigration Commission on occupations of immigrants . He was the author of many census reports on child labor , the insane , divorce , and kindred subjects . Hill was particularly interested in race and nationality , and added questions and categories to the census in both 1910 and 1920 that would record more detailed information on those subjects , among them returning to use the racial designation of `` mulatto '' that had been removed from the 1900 census . He was appointed Assistant Director of the Census in 1921 .   
 Although revised by Edward Vermilye Huntington , Hill is credited with the conception of the Method of Equal Proportions or Huntington-Hill method of apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to the states , as a function of their populations determined in the U.S. census [ 1 ] . This mathematical algorithm has been used in the U.S. since 1941 and is currently the method used .

Salim Al-Ahmed ( Arabic : دير الصول على خلف الصلوين‎ ; 2 October 1891 – 7 October 1988 ) was a Moroccan economist and general practitioner.  
 Salim Al-Ahmed was born in Seba-El-Sheikh in Morocco. His father, Salim el-Mohammed Al-Ahmed ( Arabic : بن سور محمد‎ ) was a Moroccan silk and linen merchant. He was educated at the McGill University, where he received his doctorate in economics in 1929. He served as the head of the Department of Economics in the university. In 1928, Al-Ahmed married Sanya Mennoun, who later married Al-Khatib, later Al-Ahmed's father-in-law.  
 In 1936, Al-Ahmed was appointed as one of the so-called `` Three Friends '' of the Government of King Fahd, an influential institution which awarded degrees and was responsible for the acquisition and preservation of Ottoman wealth. He also was one of the senior bureaucrats of the King-run economy. Salim Al-Ahmed was involved in the development of the Ministry of Culture and Education in 1937, working with President Mohamed Ghozlan. During this time, Al-Ahmed came into conflict with former Prime Minister Muhammad Zeineh and King Fahd's son, Mohamed II, who despised the way Al-Ahmed could work for the government. In 1938, Al-Ahmed was one of the leaders of the fight against the government's plans to eliminate subsidies and eliminate subsidies. While at the Ministry of Culture, Al-Ahmed put forward a radical economic program in order to reverse the devastating effects of the Great Depression.  
 In 1939, Al-Ahmed was appointed by the Egyptian government to head the Moroccan Advisory Council of the Middle East. The Council, created by the monarch in recognition of the efforts of Moroccans to cooperate with the Arab world, has since carried out a great deal of activities in the Middle East and Africa. It represents Morocco and other southern African countries and many of the European countries in the Middle East, which in 1946 established the International Institute of Morocco and for the liberation of Moroccans in the French Mandate. The Chairman of the Council, Manuel Sendsay, was initially opposed to Al-Ahmed's appointment. He stated that, despite the external influence of the central government, the Moroccans would be able to avoid compromising, or being dominated by the countries to the north. In 1948, Al-Ahmed was appointed Minister of Finance, replacing Bedouin Sarda, who was also appointed as an advisor to the government. Later, with the approval of the Sultan, Al-Ahmed returned to politics in 1958.

Robert Creel ( December 5, 1858 – November 19, 1943 ) was an American psychiatrist and sociologist. He was the fourth of eight children of Andrew Creel and Miss Annie Gray, and educated at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Creel grew up in Owensboro, Missouri, and attended Phillips Exeter Academy. After completing his medical studies at the Massachusetts Medical School, Creel was a faculty member at Reed College in New York City, a professor of psychology at New York University, and then a fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. During the Second World War he worked as a military psychologist. He worked as a psychologist to a variety of military organizations, including the US Army and the US Air Force.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Creel's work focused on power relations, how people think about their roles in society and how people use power. He noted a great difference between moral and physical power, and he compared his work to H. L. Mencken's own research in comparing patterns of attitudes to the condition of mental illness. He claimed that all men have a frame of mind, which is what it is to be human. His work provides a way to divide up power with related concepts of morality and power. Creel's theory of ethical psychology included his theories of identification and its interaction with health ( a concept he shared with H. L. Mencken ) and character and morality and character ( a concept he shared with Sigmund Freud ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Creel's father was John Creel, a lawyer, and his mother was Madeleine Arundel. His sister Helen Creel was a correspondent in the archives of the Scottish Parliament. Robert Creel was related to the U.S. Army, one of five sons, but left the service in 1942 when he had to serve in France and China, where he did field work. While in China he developed schizophrenia. He spent his time being seen as a simple soldier by those around him and his self-reliance in living a selfish lifestyle led him to be high on marijuana and other drug use, along with opium addiction, and he considered himself an alcoholic. He also became involved in opium smuggling which resulted in an arrest in 1941.From 1958 to 1962 Creel lived with a friend and work colleague, the writer and social activist Ernest Payne. This relationship lasted until the onset of Creel's psychotic episode. He received treatment from Payne for his schizophrenia and went on to have a productive, productive and fulfilling academic career.In 1965 Creel married Hattie Hinckley, who he met while serving as a recruiter for the US Army. The couple had a son, Alec. Creel died of a heart attack in his home in 1983 and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

His first major field trip was an expedition to Lake Eyre , led by Gerald Harnett Halligan , taking along boats in the expectation of finding islands surrounded by lakes or an inland sea .   
 Fletcher was also engaged in expeditions to Mount Kosciuszko , making collections of invertebrates and plant material in 1929 , and made an attempted crossing of the Simpson Desert as second in command to the geologist Cecil Madigan .   
 He was involved in the discovery of a remarkable fossil find at Canowindra , a slab of Devonian rock preserving the remains of one hundred fish .   
 He made many expeditions in sometimes highly adverse conditions , often field trips to obtain fossil specimens , and reported his findings and observations in articles published in the Records and Magazine of his museum .

 = Emanuel Sperner =   
Emanuel Sperner ( 9 December 1905 – 31 January 1980 ) was a German mathematician , best known for two theorems . He was born in Waltdorf ( near Neiße , Upper Silesia , now Nysa , Poland ) , and died in Sulzburg-Laufen , West Germany . He was a student at Carolinum in Nysa and then Hamburg University where his advisor was Wilhelm Blaschke . He was appointed Professor in Königsberg in 1934 , and subsequently held posts in a number of universities until 1974 .   
 Sperner 's theorem , from 1928 , says that the size of an antichain in the power set of an n-set ( a Sperner family ) is at most the middle binomial coefficient ( s ) . It has several proofs and numerous generalizations , including the Sperner property of a partially ordered set .   
 Sperner 's lemma , from 1928 , states that every Sperner coloring of a triangulation of an n-dimensional simplex contains a cell colored with a complete set of colors . It was proven by Sperner to provide an alternate proof of a theorem of Lebesgue characterizing dimensionality of Euclidean spaces . It was later noticed that this lemma provides a direct proof of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem without explicit use of homology.Sperner 's students included Kurt Leichtweiss and Gerhard Ringel .

 = Edwin Butterworth =   
Edwin Butterworth ( 1 October 1812 – 19 April 1848 ) was an English topographer , writer on local history , and journalist . He is known particularly as a researcher for Edward Baines 's history of Lancashire .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Butterworth was the tenth and youngest child of the topographer James Butterworth , and was born at Pitses , near Oldham , in 1812 . He followed in the footsteps of his father , whom he assisted in his later works , but was more given to statistical research . When Edward Baines undertook the preparation of a history of Lancashire , he found a useful colleague in Edwin Butterworth , who visited many parts of the county in order to collect the requisite particulars.During the six years in which he was engaged by Edward Baines he travelled on foot through nearly every town and village in the county . His own notes and those of his father formed a large mass of manuscript material . Later researchers have noted that Butterworth not only provided material for Baines 's history of Lancashire , but also , without acknowledgement , wrote most of the text.He wrote local history books , which produced little remuneration ; his main income was as a journalist , acting as correspondent for several Manchester newspapers . He was for a considerable time registrar of births and deaths for the township of Chadderton.In 1847 Butterworth conceived the idea of publishing a history of Lancashire in fifty volumes , based on his extensive notes ; each volume , while part of the general series , would also be complete in itself . This project was encouraged by the Earl of Ellesmere . Overtures were made to Samuel Bamford , as it was thought that his pleasant style and Butterworth 's facts would make a popular combination . The suggestion was roughly treated by the Earl , and Butterworth 's death occurred before such a plan could have been completed.He is described by those who knew him as genial and modest . Butterworth died , unmarried , of typhoid fever on 19 April 1848 . He was buried at Greenacres cemetery in Oldham , and in 1859 a monument to his memory was erected there by public subscription . Such of his books and manuscripts ( including material inherited from his father ) as had not been accidentally dispersed were purchased by the Platt Brothers , and by them presented to the town . They are now in Oldham Local Studies and Archives .

 = William Fielding Rutherford =  
William Fielding Rutherford FRSE LLD ( 1869–1944 ) was an English scientist, mathematician, and astronomer.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Rutherford was born in London on 10 October 1869. He studied philosophy at the University of Cambridge under Samuel Alcock, graduating BSc in 1880. He was appointed lecturer in the natural philosophy department of the Royal College of Physicians in 1883 and graduated MSc in 1884. He then returned to England to take up a professorial post at the University of Cambridge ( BSc, 1887 ) and subsequently to Dean's School of Music at Aberdeen, where he was appointed a lecturer in 1894. He served as head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy from 1899 until his retirement in 1927.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Rutherford was among the leaders of the Cambridge Mathematical Society, and his papers are housed at the Cambridge Science Library. His Letters and Papers on the Equilibrium of Atomic Masses in 1918, The following year, he wrote a much anticipated paper, `` The Equilibrium of Aqueous Hydrogen-Hepatic Mixtures '', in which he conjectured that the final state for a gas molecule to become hot was likely to be what is sometimes called a liquid state, where the density of hydrogen in the form of oxygen is maximized ; this form would at least approximate the state of equilibrium.In 1910 Rutherford's investigation into the chemical character of the ozone produced his paper A Treatise on the Chemistry of the Atmosphere, and it was largely in this paper that Rutherford first proposed the idea of an `` upper boundary '' for the ozone layer. While most scientists assumed that the upper boundary was negligible, he postulated that the higher a region of the atmosphere the more saturation it would have, and that the thickest atmosphere was the best ground for the formation of ozone.  
 In 1917 Rutherford set off on a nine-year European exploration of the Earth, accompanied by the explorer Edwin Chadwick and Ernest Shackleton, which culminated in Rutherford's publication, The Day before it Went to Space ( Oxford University Press, 1920 ). The initial aim of the exploration was to gather information on the elements of the solar system, but it also sought to develop the understanding of the solar system's orbit, and to determine the position of the Sun. He visited the lunar surface, visits a number of other planets and asteroids, and visited several moons.  
 In 1925 Rutherford discovered what he referred to as `` the tiny beautiful nickel '', which he named Van Allen. In 1927 he reported discovering the triple-star Alpha V on the left side of the far side of the Earth.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 An asteroid 14209 Rutherford discovered in 1929 is named in his honour. A crater on the Moon is named for him. In 2010, the International Astronomical Union announced that Rutherford had won the Nobel Prize in Physics. His planetary observations were featured in the film Galileo, starring Will Smith, alongside Nobel Laureate John Gerard. In addition, several large satellite observatories are named in his honour.

 === Scientist and botanist ===   
 Palmberg published in 1671 a dissertation in Latin on scurvy – Exercitatiomedica brevissimam Scorbuti delineationem exhibeus . However , it was his floral textbook – Serta Florea Svecana or Swenske Örtekrantz ( 1684 ) – that has contributed the most to life sciences . It was used in Sweden as textbook in botany during sixty years before replaced by Carl von Linnés Flora Svecica in 1745 and was the source of Carl Linnaeus early botanical understanding . Örtekrantzen was published in three editions , the most recent as late as 1738 .   
    
    
 === Public educator ===   
 Palmberg was also an early public educator and published a number of popular scientific essays in the Swedish language which were included in the almanacs of 1670–1672 with medical advice based on Hippocratic medicine . The therapeutic use of herbs such as camille flowers , ginger , valeriana , wormwood and vervain is described as well as blood-letting , purging and cupping therapy . In these essays Palmberg strongly advocated against quackery and the use of astrology for medical divination .

Irina Bakhskaya ( 21 January 1914 – 21 December 1992 ) was a Soviet-born pianist and music educator. A fellow of the famous St Petersburg Conservatory, she studied music theory under Tchaikovsky and Klute, developed the Bulgarian folk song cycle, and later taught traditional Bulgarian music to orchestra students. The song cycle Kvachgok ( In the Belly of the Bell ) first performed in 1960, which was printed as a text book for the high school orchestra, inspired the Bulgarian composer Svetlana Vuková.  
 Bakhskaya's music received its name from the nymph Irina, and her passion for traditional Bulgarian folk songs inspired the creation of a complete musical cycle based on these folk songs. The cycle forms the second cycle after the Soviet melodrama `` Sarah's Misery ''.

 = Karl von Pfeufer =   
Karl Sebastian von Pfeufer ( 22 December 1806 – 13 September 1869 ) was a German physician who was a native of Bamberg .   
 He studied at Erlangen and Würzburg , and afterwards served as an assistant to Johann Lukas Schönlein ( 1793–1864 ) . In 1840 he became a professor and director at the medical clinic in Zurich , and from 1844 worked at the university clinic in Heidelberg . In 1852 he was named clinical professor in the second medical division at the general hospital in Munich . Some of his better known students and assistants were Friedrich Albert von Zenker ( 1825–1898 ) , Adolf Kussmaul ( 1822–1902 ) , Theodor von Dusch ( 1824-1890 ) and Otto Leichtenstern ( 1845–1900 ) .   
 Karl Pfeufer is remembered for his collaboration with anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jacob Henle ( 1809–1885 ) , an association that began in the early 1840s at Zurich . The two doctors are credited as forerunners of German scientific medicine , and were pioneers in their attempts to create a synthesis between laboratory and clinic . In 1844 they founded a journal on `` rational medicine '' called Zeitschrift für rationelle Medizin , which was to become one of the more important medical journals in the German language . Pfeufer would maintain written correspondence with Henle until his death in 1869 .   
 Another publication by Pfeufer was an 1837 treatise on the cholera epidemic at Mittenwald , titled Bericht über die Cholera-Epidemie in Mittenwald .

 = Richard Cornell =   
Richard Cornell ( 1625—1693 ) was an English Quaker ironmaster and resident of Long Island who is generally considered the first European settler on the Rockaway Peninsula in the present-day Borough of Queens , New York City . Cornell purchased the Rockaway land from another Englishman , Captain John Palmer , in 1687 , and settled there in 1690 . His grandfather was Thomas Cornell ( settler ) .   
 Cornell 's descendants owned much land in Rockaway , much of which was partitioned into 46 parcels in 1820 , which were eventually sold to outsiders , and their property was still being sold even in the late 19th century , as for example the sale of the land comprising the present-day neighborhood of Bayswater to William Trist Bailey in 1878 .   
 The Cornell homestead by the beachfront was later the site of the Marine Pavilion .   
 The Cornell Family Cemetery on Gateway Boulevard in Far Rockaway has been designated as a New York City Landmark .

 = Georg Schuller =  
Georg Schuller ( 11 March 1879 – 25 October 1952 ) was a German psychiatrist and psychotherapist who pioneered psychoanalytic psychotherapy in Germany.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Georg Schuller was born on 11 March 1879 in Baden, German Empire. From 1883 to 1891, he studied at the gymnasium in Bonn, before transferring to the University of Bonn in 1890 to further his studies and obtaining a doctorate in medicine ( Doctorphilosophie ) in 1893. In 1890, he returned to his native Germany, where he taught at the University of Würzburg, where he received a postdoctoral fellowship in psychology from August Fischer. In 1896, he became a visiting professor at the University of Halle. He returned to Bonn to become a full professor in 1900, and served as the head of the Department of Psychology at the university until 1919.  
 In 1900, Schuller published Psychoanalysis der Beziehung des katholischefskonferenzens ( Psychoanalysis of the object of sexual repression ), in which he set forth what is still considered to be one of the most influential theories of psychoanalysis in the 20th century. Psychoanalysts at the time were working on their works in recognition of the `` critical theory '' of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysts thought this concept of criticism to show that psychoanalysis was a genuine investigation of the subject, providing a solution to the question of his relation to the world. He became famous in Germany as a leader in the integration of psychoanalytic psychology into mainstream psychology. Schuller proved that Freud and other “ more conservative ” theorists was able to express their conclusions coherently within a priori analytical conditions. In Psychoanalysis der Beziehung des katholischefskonferenzens, Schuller linked psychoanalysis to scientific method as outlined by Freud, thereby starting a chain of dialog between psychoanalysts and psychoanalysts. Psychoanalysts had spent more than 100 years trying to find an understanding of the concept of the 'object of repression'through an analytical framework of his.In 1901, Schuller published an essay `` Subjective and objective control : also '' ( 1907 ) that he wrote about his approach to the subject. He argued that the more one attempts to control oneself, the more suffering that he will experience. He also argued that there is no contradiction between psychological processes that are self-reproducing and psychological processes that are self-destructive. These theories were well known at the time and Schuller continued to work on them after his retirement.  
   
 In the 1920s and 1930s, psychoanalysts such as Philipp Riesenbach, Hans Bülow, and Georg Philipp Engelbrecht devoted their time to the study of psychoanalysis. Schuller, Schüll, and Emil Kraepelin founded a movement known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy in the 1930s. As his research and teaching became more influential, Schuller himself became known as the “ creator of psychoanalysis ”, “ one of the most influential scientists in German psychoanalysis '', and “ one of the most original and versatile therapists in the field ''. He is considered the father of the modern psychoanalysis.  
 In 1942, Schuller was arrested by the Gestapo for attempting to disseminate `` schadenfreude '' in German mass culture. After the war, his writings were published as Archiv für psychoanalytische psychologie, and were republished after the war.

 = Jacob R. Gilbert =  
Jacob R. Gilbert ( August 26, 1911 – March 2, 1998 ) was a Jewish academic, writer and biographer who served as editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, the Jewish Publication Society, a founding member of the American Jewish Committee, and a contributing editor to the National Jewish Encyclopedia and the American Journal of History. He is considered by many to be the best person to explain the Enlightenment at the time.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born in Ottawa, Canada. He earned a Master of Arts degree in law from Mount Allison College, Nebraska, and a law degree from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. He was a Jew from early childhood. He later became an Orthodox Jew.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At the age of twenty-eight, Gilbert began a long and productive career as a New York-based journalist and historian of Judaism. He later became editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, which was founded in 1933, which was still the most widely used bibliography on the subject. The Jewish Encyclopedia was also a founding member of the American Jewish Committee, a Jewish fundraising organization that stands for a growing network of Jewish organizations in the United States. It was during this period that he also wrote a short-story collection, Red Clouds in My Life, which he eventually published. From 1937 to 1941, he served as a lecturer at Queens College, New York.  
 Gilbert made several important contributions to the Jewish Encyclopedia, the first of which was the first list of Jewish characters and places on which Gilbert had published ; The Japanese in Western Europe. This work resulted in Gilbert's longest but least well-known article, dated July 27, 1941, `` Jews of the Orient ''.He had a deep interest in Jewish history, and also assisted the University of Wisconsin in its investigation of the antisemitism and persecution of Jews at that time. On October 10, 1939, the company for which he was serving for two years hired him to participate in a massive search for Jews in the city and surrounding countryside. The Daily Beast, a Jewish-oriented daily publication of the same name, wrote of Gilbert, `` a singular talent. The cornerstone of his mastery of the subject lies with his diction... [ and ] his accuracy in practically every instance ''. It is impossible to estimate the quality of his argumentation, but his work is remarkable for its lucid exposition of important issues, and it appears, as one may expect, to be an effortless refresher for anyone attempting to answer similar questions in the past.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 He wrote books on biblical history and Jewish thought, was a frequent contributor to the Bulletin of the Jewish Publication Society, and was a constant contributor to the American Jewish Encyclopedia. In 1986, Gilbert was awarded the National Jewish Encyclopedia's Lai David Medal.  
 He died in Washington, D.C., on March 2, 1998. His wife, Dorothy, died on June 23, 1989.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Gilbert was married to Ruth Hope Berker Katz. They had two children, Kenneth M. Gilbert and Nadia Mahlmeyer Gilbert. After his wife's death in 1991, he married ( with Dorothy ) William B. Merriam ( 1906–1983 ).Their children are Samuel Chaim Solomon Gilbert ( 1986–2003 ), Ruth Katz Gilbert ( 1987–2003 ), and Shimon Basiliach Gilbert ( 1986–2004 ).

 Hilde Gotthelf Kapp was the eldest daughter of Hjalmar Kapp and Anna Carvin.  
 Kapp studied geography and botany at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. As a student she was hired by the educational department of the Bergen City Market, and after several years became a registered business woman. Kapp employed herself as a teacher of geography and botany at the city school, but at the end of 1866, she emigrated to Kiel where she engaged in botanical botanical investigations.  
 Kapp married in 1865 a plant collector named Erik Flóinen ( 1827–1909 ).  
 Kapp and Erik Flóinen also had a daughter, Kirsten Johan Harald, who in 1871 married the botanist, Gotthelf Hermann Sekel ( 1836–1909 ).  
 From 1886, Gotthelf Kapp wrote a pioneering article in the scientific journal `` Zeitschrift für Paläontologie '' on the plant genera Poseifera and Arctostaphylus. In that article she proposed the classification of plants according to genera which are `` conspicuous and regular and preferred forms ''. This was the beginning of the plant genus classification as it is still used today.

Salvator Léonardi ( born Catania , Italy 1872 – died 1938 ) was a mandolin virtuoso , teacher and composer . He taught in Egypt , Malta , London and Paris for more than 20 years , and also toured as a performer . Léonardi learned mandolin and guitar from an uncle , but went on to become a professional musician , studying the violin at a Naples conservatory . He won awards as a solo mandolinist at international music competitions in Florence and Rome .   
    
 Léonardi was the author of the Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo ( Method for Banjolin and Mandolin-Banjo ) . The book was rare among texts teaching mandolin , because it taught his method in three languages at once , English , French and Spanish . In the third edition of his mandolin-banjo method ( 1921 ) , he stated in the introduction that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times . In writing his book , he noted the instrument was soaring in popularity in the shape of the banjo . He did not just recycle old material for his book , but also included his own compositions , including Souvenir de Malta , Caminando ( a tango ) , Souvenir de Rome , Un Beso Por Teléfono , Qui-Pro-Quo , Rêverie , and Capriccio ( a polka ) .As a music teacher , Léonardi was unsure of whether to include jazz in his book , saying he thought it a faddish style of playing that might not be around very long . In spite of his speculation , he chose to include the section on how to play jazz , noting that he had played with American jazz bands after World War I.He is known for composing Souvenir de Catania , Souvenir de Napoli , Souvenir de Sicile , and Angeli e Demoni .

But at the same time he sought , like other representatives of this school of thought , such as KG Bretschneider and Julius Wegscheider , to keep in close touch with the historical theology of the Protestant churches . The term Offenbarungsrationalismus ( `` epiphanic rationalism '' ) has been used to express Ammon 's intermediate views .   
    
 He was a man of great versatility and extensive learning , a philologist and philosopher as well as a theologian , and a very voluminous author .

In 1855 he succeeded Gustav Mahler as Professor of Hindolmian Music and Morality, and remained there until his death.  
 In 1860 Mozart wrote Die Böhm- und Wahrheiten im Sachsenwald in F minor, a significant work for the composer and for modern music in general. The music became well known, and became a standard work throughout Germany. With Ludwig van Beethoven, Brahms and Leopold Stokowski he premiered several early works for the piano. In the next decade he also worked with the five principal composers in Germany, including Ravel, Immanuel Kant, Joseph Haydn, and Ludwig van Beethoven. Mozart's sonatas were published posthumously by the Mozarteum des Bodensee in 1863. He also wrote works for piano, particularly two Morceaux, and wrote a sonata for piano in F minor, Sonata in E flat major.  
 Mozart was the author of, among other works, The American Sonatas, with introduction by Joseph Haydn, The Piano Sonata in A minor, ( 1878 ), and the Pre-Raphaelite Dogmatics, ( 1893 ). He is also credited with the melody in Die Schlesischen Nachschrift, ( 1865 ), and as an author of incidental music for the Operas Polonaise, Queen Mary, and Der Rosenkavalier. He was also the author of several other works, such as a translation of Wagner's Wolfenbüttel, and a revision of Shakespeare's Hamlet. The well-known opera Le Grand Duc d'Or in D minor premiered on 18 August 1902, and went on to become an important ballet in Germany. The opera Richesse in D major premiered in 1913, and was completed during the First World War.

 == Life ==   
 He was born in Dublin , Ireland , the son of Henry Samuel Close , a well-known lawyer whose family came from Drumbanagher in County Armagh . He was educated at Weymouth and at Trinity College , Dublin , where he graduated in 1846 ; and two years later he entered holy orders.For a year he was curate of All Saints , Northampton ; from 1849 to 1857 he was rector of Shangton in Leicestershire ; and then for four years he was curate of Waitham-on-the-Wolds .   
 On the death of his father in 1861 he returned to Dublin , and while giving his services to various churches in the city , devoted himself almost wholly to literary and scientific pursuits , and especially to the glacial geology of Ireland , on which subject he became an acknowledged authority . His paper , read before the Royal Geological Society of Ireland in 1866 , on the General Glaciation of Ireland is a masterly description of the effects of glaciation , and of the evidence in favor of the action of land-ice . Later on he discussed the origin of the elevated shell-bearing gravels near Dublin and expressed the view that they were accumulated by floating ice when the land had undergone submergence.In 1872 George H Kinahan and Maxwell Close published jointly an important paper entitled The Glaciation of Iar-Connaught and its Neighbourhood in the Counties of Galway and Mayo . It was a private publication , accompanied by a large map showing the pattern of striae over Connemara and south Mayo.He was for a time treasurer of the Royal Irish Academy , an active member of the Royal Dublin Society , and president in 1878 of the Royal Geological Society of Ireland . Astronomy and physics , as well as the ancient language and antiquities of Ireland , attracted his attention . He was a founder member of the Gaelic Union , which he helped to finance , and the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language . Through the last decades of the 19th century he was Treasurer to both these societies . He was also a very early member of Conradh na Gaeilge , the Gaelic League , which he supported financially . In his will he left £1,000 for the publication of a dictionary of Irish based largely on the old manuscripts . The first volume was published in 1913 and the final volume in 1973 .   
 Close died in Dublin on 12 of September 1903 .

Alexander Filippovich Postels ( Russian : Александр Филиппович Постельс ; 24 August 1801 Dorpat – 26 June 1871 Vyborg ) , was a Baltic German of Russian citizenship naturalist , mineralogist and artist .   
 Postels studied at St.Petersburg Imperial University and in 1826 lectured there on inorganic chemistry .   
 In the 1820s political relations between Russia and the United States were troubled by the extent of Russian territory in North America . Russia intended to enforce its claims by sending two warships to the disputed areas . When the two countries agreed on 54°40′N as the southern limit of Russian claims , Czar Nicolas I changed their orders in 1826 to an extended three-year survey of the Russian-American and Asian coasts .   
 Otto von Kotzebue had returned on 10 July 1826 from his voyage of discovery aboard Predpriyatiye . On 16 August 1826 , Captain Lieutenant Fedor Petrovich Litke , sailed on board the Russian vessel Senyavin , accompanied by the Möller under Captain Lieutenant M. N. Staniukovich . Postels sailed with Litke as a naturalist/artist and had the distinction of being the first St. Petersburg University graduate to join such a large-scale expedition . On board were also the naturalist Karl Heinrich Mertens ( 1796-1830 ) , who died in Kronstadt shortly after his return from Iceland and another trip on the Senyavin , and the ornithologist Baron von Kittlitz .   
    
 Their orders were to   
 `` reconnoitre and describe the coasts of Kamchatka , the land of the Chuchkis and the Koriaks ( the coasts of which have not yet been described by anyone , and which are unknown except by the voyage of Captain Bering ) ; the coasts of the Okhotsk Sea , and the Shantar Islands , which although they are known to us , have not been sufficiently described . ''   
 The expedition sailed from Kronstadt , the Russian port on Kotlin Island , via Portsmouth and rounded Cape Horn on 24 February 1827 . The Senyavin called at Concepcion in Chile , before sailing north to Sitka , and arriving at Petropavlovsk in mid-September . They explored the Caroline Islands and the Bonin-Jima group for four months , returning to Kamchatka in May . During the summer they sailed from Avacha Bay to Karaginskii Island and on through the Bering Strait to reconnoitre the coast as far north as the Anadyr River . They returned via Manila and the Cape of Good Hope , arriving back in Kronstadt on 16 September 1829.The expedition was called the largest and most productive voyage of discovery of the era , and brought back some 4 000 natural history specimens , including mammals , insects , birds , plants , and minerals . More than 1250 sketches of their findings were made on the voyage . Twelve island groups were discovered along the Asian coast , and 26 Caroline Islands were explored and described . The flattening of the Earth 's poles was investigated using an invariable pendulum . Postels was appointed assistant-professor of the Department of Mineralogy and Geology of St.Petersburg University . During the voyage Postels depicted more than 100 seaweeds or marine algae from the northern Pacific in `` Illustrationes algarum in itinere circa orbem jussu Imperatoriis Nicolai I '' published in St. Petersburg in 1840 . The seaweed genus Postelsia is named in his honour . This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Postels when citing a botanical name.Postels was elected an Honorary Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences on 14 January 1866 and invited to act as curator of the Mineralogical Museum . He tutored the Grand Duchesses Maria and Ekaterina , daughters of Czar Nicolas I 's brother Mikhail , and was the tutor of Prince Oldenburgski 's children .

 Robb studied at Queen 's College in Belfast ( BA 1894 ) and at St John 's College in Cambridge ( Tripos 1897 , MA 1901 ) . He then proceeded to University of Göttingen , where , guided by Woldemar Voigt , he wrote his dissertation on the Zeeman effect . He also worked under J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory . The Croix de Guerre was awarded to him for WWI service in the Red Cross , and in 1921 he became a fellow of the Royal Society.He is known for his four books on special relativity ( 1911 , 1914 , 1921 , 1936 ) where he gave a spacetime derivation of the theory in an axiomatic-geometric way . Robb therefore was sometimes called the `` Euclid of relativity '' . In the first of these works he used a hyperbolic angle ω to introduce the concept of rapidity and showed that the kinematic space of velocities is hyperbolic , so that `` instead of a Euclidean triangle of velocities , we get a Lobachevski triangle of rapidities '' .   
 However , contrary to the scientific mainstream , he believed that the works of Joseph Larmor and Hendrik Lorentz were more important for relativity than the works of Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski .

Johann Jacob Paul Moldenhawer ( 11 February 1766 – 21 August 1827 ) was a German botanist who made a number of important discoveries in plant anatomy .   
 He was born in Hamburg , the son of a minister , and started out studying theology and the classics . At some unknown point he became interested in plants , and in 1791 he published Tentamen in historiam plantarum Theophrasti , on Theophrastus , and the following year he is recorded as `` Extraordinary Professor of Botany and Fruit Tree Culture '' ( außerordentlicher Professor für Botanik und Obstbau ) at the University of Kiel . He studied plant anatomy from 1795 until 1812 , when he published Beyträge zur Anatomie der Pflanzen on his results . Immediately subsequently he concentrated on fruit tree culture . He died in Kiel .   
 Moldenhawer 's contributions center on the microscopic examination of plant tissues , for which he devised techniques to separate the cells from the middle lamella layer that separates them . He identified vascular and parenchymatous tissues , described vascular bundles , observed the cells in the cambium , and interpreted tree rings . He found that stomata were composed pairs of cells , rather than a single cell with a hole . Although Moldenhawer is not credited with the cell theory , his work provided key documentation for the validity of the theory in plants .   
 The genus Moldenhawera is named in his honor .

 = Anatoly Antonovich Baresi =  
Anatoly Antonovich Baresi ( Russian : Патон Самперьич Бабланиевич ; 25 June [ O.S. 26 June ] 1868 – 28 July 1944 ) was a Russian inventor. He introduced the digital camcorder, a watch which utilised various types of electronic structures to provide different modes of automatic counting of times. This made for a versatile, and valuable, tool for scientific experimentation. His camera of the same name was later added to the U.S. Patent Office in 1892.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Baresi was born in Oryol ( now in the central part of the Caspian Sea ) in the family of an engineer. He studied natural sciences and applied mathematics at the University of Moscow, where his advisor was Vadim Šimfiev. He was awarded a doctorate in 1875.  
 In 1882 he started working at the diyedin pen-development facility for the country's Central Machine Works ( today Эфин Титемировского годольбич ), a collaboration between city government and companies, who provided parts for the country's zodiac, clocks, railway and others. Baresi's early assistants included Dmitri Grigoryev, Aleksei Vishnevskii, and Anatoly V. Rabinovich. He taught the process of preserving lead in metallurgical works as well as the export of metal-diluted lead.  
 In 1889 he was appointed a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Moscow.  
 From 1902, Baresi created a new form of automated cinema, the Digital Camcorder ( Воспольдение карической и Москвед ). The device introduced synchronisation of film recording with the information about the time it was to be shot. Baresi's inventions are still used today.  
 Baresi was also the inventor of a separate photographic camera. The Baresi camera's inter-changable type uses a camera mounted on a movable stand, for the fast gathering of materials. Its principle is to focus the rays of a photographic flash over a horizontal plane, for taking pictures with a set amount of exposure time.  
 Baresi's petrochemical facility was in the path of war, and he began working as engineer at the National Bank of Latvia in 1894. In 1899, he worked for the FOM and became head of the Leningrad Metallurgy Institute. In 1901, he was named to a seat in the Soviet Academy of Sciences, one of three Mensheviks.  
 Baresi died of heart attack in Vienna.

Abraham Darby , in his lifetime called Abraham Darby the Younger , referred to for convenience as Abraham Darby II ( 12 May 1711 – 31 March 1763 ) was the second man of that name in an English Quaker family that played an important role in the early years of the Industrial Revolution .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Darby was born in Coalbrookdale , Shropshire to Abraham and Mary ( née Sergeant ) .   
 He followed in his father 's footsteps in the Darby foundry business in Coalbrookdale , producing cast iron cooking pots , kettles , and other goods . The Coalbrookdale Company also played an important role in using iron to replace the more expensive brass for cylinders for Thomas Newcomen 's steam engines .   
 He and his partners were responsible for a very important innovation in introducing the use of coke pig iron as the feedstock for finery forges . This formed a significant part of the output of Horsehay and Ketley Furnaces , which they built in the late 1750s . His father 's successful use of coke pig iron as foundry feedstock , and his own success in using it as forge feedstock were two of the steps towards the industrial revolution for the iron industry , but the final breakthrough that permitted the great expansion of iron production that constitutes the industrial revolution for it came later .   
 He died aged 51 . He had married twice : firstly Margaret Smith ( died 1740 ) , with whom he had three children including Hannah who married Richard Reynolds , and secondly the Quaker minister Abiah Maude , with whom he had a further thirteen children although only four including Abraham Darby III survived .

Michel Matthew Ter-Pogossian ( April 21 , 1925 – June 19 , 1996 ) was an Armenian-American nuclear physicist who is one of the fathers of positron emission tomography ( PET ) , the first functional brain imaging technology . PET could effectively be used to evaluate what areas of the brain were active during various mental processes versus looking at the structure of the brain through conventional CT .   
 Ter-Pogossian was born in Berlin , the only child of Armenian parents who had settled in Germany after escaping the Armenian Genocide during World War I . The family moved to France when Michel was a young child . During World War II , he fought with the French resistance . He earned degrees in science from the University of Paris and from the Institute of Radium . In 1946 , he emigrated to the United States to attend Washington University of St. Louis ; he later joined the faculty of Washington University School of Medicine . He was married in 1966 to Ann Scott Dodson and had three children and six grandchildren .   
 PET scanning is one of the most promising techniques for cancer detection and has applications in monitoring heart disease . The development of new radioligands may allow more uses of positron emission tomography for other areas in medicine .   
 The technique uses the injection of ultrashort acting radioactive substances commonly bound to water or deoxyglucose . The deoxyglucose method directly measures brain metabolism whereas the radioactively labeled water is effective at measuring brain blood flow .

 = John Joyce (violinist) =  
John Joyce ( 12 June 1873, Longford – 8 May 1954, Bristol ) was a leading member of the English chamber orchestra, and one of its most influential musicians. He won a number of prizes in the chamber, including the RIBA Gold Medal.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 John Joyce was born in Longford in 1873, the only son of John Walter Joyce, a parish schoolmaster and farmer, and his wife, the artist Frances Stanton. He started to play first violin when he was about four years old. His father died of tuberculosis in 1884 and Joyce remained under a state care until 1889, when he became a lodger in the Public House in Longford, where he was exposed to the music of both singers and instrumentalists. He made his first recorded appearance at the age of 13, when he was very much in need of money. He studied violin and composition at the Paris Conservatory, where he won a prize for First violin and First Violin Concerto with Giulio Renni, during his three-year studies in 1909-10.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
 From 1909-10, he was a composer at the home of the famous composer Andrew Stanley. The San Carlo Music School was a joint venture between Stanley and Joyce, and they spent considerable time together under the tutelage of William Smeaton and Sarah Williams. In 1914, they separated and graduated from the San Carlo Music School.  
 Joyce's first recordings as a soloist came in 1913 at the New Academy in Marlborough-on-Sea. He was invited to play with Coventry School of Music in 1918.  
 In 1923, Joyce wrote the arrangement of the piano trio Ye Olde Minerva's Nymphomena.  
 Joyce became a member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ( REMO ) in 1930, following which he gave the Bartok Music Awards for string quartets with them. He remained with REMO until 1936, when he was to be replaced as founder by Stanley, who at the time had been recovering from a stroke. During the Second World War, Joyce was commissioned to play with the Army Air Corps. In the 1940s, he gave concert tours of Britain and the United States, and also appeared as principal of two opera houses. He wrote the arrangements for the symphonies of Mozart and Beethoven, and the duo aria for the violin concerto `` L ’ Egido '' for the Royal Albert Hall.His membership of the chamber orchestra was renewed in 1947. In 1950, he became a member of the British Chamber Music Teachers Association. He was awarded the Olivier Award in 1953, and gave numerous guest concerts with the organization. At the time, he wrote an introduction to a report on the new chamber orchestra of the Royal Society of Arts. He continued to compose, notably with John Charles Bradshaw. He later married Jean Ketcham, with whom he had a son, John Charles.  
   
   
 == Honours and awards ==  
 In 1934, Joyce was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) by Queen Elizabeth II.  
 In 1942, he was awarded the Stanley Medal by the Royal College of Music ( RCM ), the HM, Queen's Printer and Medal.The Joyce archive of unclassified records and documents from the Heritage Lottery Fund is kept at the Nuffield Library and Museum in Dorset.The production of the 1963 chamber music standard, Coventry's Noble Songs of the Echos, which featured parts by both Joyce and Stanley, was dedicated to Joyce by John Costello.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Joyce married Jean Ketcham on 27 August 1929, while he was resident in Coventry. They had a son, Stephen, and a daughter, Marie, who died in a motor accident in their early forties. In 1952, Joyce was inducted into the Institut Gallimard de Paris. On 23 November 1956, he became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Joyce was a founding member of the British Music Society. The house he created in Bristol was named in his honour. Joyce had a son, Landon with Jean Ketcham, and a daughter with Michele Homaglia.

 = Margaret Frank =  
Margaret ( Marie ) Frank ( 1916 – 28 August 2003 ) was an English naturalist who worked on fisheries and the study of wetlands. A keen bird-watcher, she lived in the UK, and became interested in the ecology of the islands of the northern coast of Shetland. She was the first scientist to show evidence that the salmonid and salmonina sharkfish ( Carcharhinus bulgaricus m. bur. ) and the alpaca, which her husband George applied to Irish shores, were parasitised by an invading fish. The research which led to the aquaculture industry of bloodworms and fritillary fungi was the work of Margaret Frank.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Margaret Frank was born Margaret Cook on 24 July 1916, in Chester, Wiltshire, England, where she lived with her sister, Jane's daughter, Irene. She was a first cousin to the British novelist Arthur Rackham Frank.When Frank was 11, her mother passed away, leaving her cousin with the responsibility of taking care of the boys. Eventually Frank worked as a seamstress in Wicklow before enrolling in Trinity College, Cambridge. She began taking aquatic physiology classes while at college. Her main interests were wildlife, including hunting and fisheries.After graduating in 1925, Frank spent a year in the U.S. working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While working at the agency she met Maurice Goldrick, an entomologist who later studied Aquatic Parasites in Freshwater Fish ( 1942 ), providing her with a critical mass of material she would use in her later work.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 During World War II Frank began work as a researcher at the University of Toronto. She became interested in the methods of entomology as a science, giving up a more settled career in veterinary medicine. She joined the Division of Fisheries Science and started the fish-disease system at the British Board of Fisheries ( BNF ) at Cambridge.Working as a lecturer, Frank started on a series of papers dealing with planktonids and other biota of the Northern Barrier. Her papers on these topics were published in the British Journal of Science in 1949 and 1950, The Health of Freshwater Fisheries ( 1952 ) and On the Freshwater Parasite ( 1955 ), all of which documented findings from sea waters collected in Cape York.  
 After completing a PhD in zoology at the University of Cambridge, Frank left the BNF in 1963 to become a researcher at the Fisheries Biosecurity Research Unit of the UK government. Her research on parasitic animal diseases and their treatment, which was carried out with an emphasis on freshwater plankton and salamanders, eventually led to a National Research Council Fellowship. She completed a number of papers and published research in both Fish and Fisheries and The Journals of Natural History. From 1979 to 1985, Frank was director of the Department of Agriculture Biological Sciences Division of a consortium to study how environmental contaminants and toxins in the UK's freshwater fisheries impact the ecology and functioning of British ecosystems.  
 Frank's research focused on the morphology, structure and ecology of freshwater creatures, specifically freshwater algae, plankton and trilobites. This work revealed a host of potential new taxa for study, for example, freshwater thallids ( Gehirnidae ), which she identified as having a `` symbiotic, cross-bridging relationship with thallid larvae, and small thallid fish and worms ''. Frank also recorded many other biological studies, focusing on the microbial ecology and ecology of freshwater organisms.Between 1984 and 1990, Frank chaired the advisory committee of the 2013 English Riviera Marine Science Festival. She was also president of the General Welfare Research Committee of the National Society of Birdwatchers and a member of the Society of Marine Ecology.The standard author abbreviation M. Frank is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The Geography of Trilobites ( now The Geography of Thallids and Monocotyls ) is a book of textbooks on cytology. The staff of the Antarctic Institute for Marine Ecology and Conservation has listed it on their website as one of their ten most influential books of the 20th century, which it is. The book was used as the basis of Brookley C. Denison's research on the Thallididae of the Antarctic.

 = Thomas Hogarth =  
Thomas Hogarth ( 21 February 1742, Colne – 15 May 1801, Colne ) was a 19th-century Gaelic poet and vernacular reader, of one of the leading English poets of his time and who was one of the founding members of the Colne College of Fine Arts.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Hogarth was born at Cranborough and educated at the grammar school, under the tutelage of his father, Thomas Hogarth. He started teaching at Colne in 1776. He was elected in 1780 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His treatise on Harmony, in 1789, appeared in the periodical New Magazines, the one to which he contributed it being those of the old spelling-critics.Hogarth married Nannie Niblett, daughter of Rev. Daniel Neill Niblett, in 1787. They had one son and five daughters.  
 In 1793, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and of the same year was knighted. He became a member of that body in 1813.Hogarth died at Colne in 1801. He is buried there.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Hogarth's early prose works are dedicated to the common poems of his native Gaelic ; his prefatory verse for a book on the English poets, published in 1776, describes in some detail the poet's experiences in Scotland during the period in question and his impressions of the manner in which Scottish society was distinguished in both Scotland and England.His best-known prose work is his play, Peter Lambeth ( 1798–1815 ). This richly illustrated and inspiring satire is set in Scotland during the time in question and contains an original and profound treatment of the Gaelic language. Although the play became mainly known in the 1850s and 1860s, the preface is usually read today. The work has been translated into French, German, Dutch, Italian, Scottish, French, Russian, and Welsh.

 == Life and career ==  
 Louis Goudge de Jeux was born in Val-de-Grâce, Chaumont, France, to an educated family. His family was members of a large pro-French patriot sect, with a significant part of its leadership supporting the National Convention of 1815, which broke up in 1817. Goudge graduated from the École Polytechnique in 1818.  
 In 1819, at age 28, he was elected professor of chemistry at the Ecole des Mines de Valence ( Montreal ), and in 1820 he received the honorific title of rector.  
 He was made professor of pharmacology and epidemiology at the Ecole royale de Pharmacie ( Paris ) in 1828, and in the following year he became co-director of the `` Air Health Office ''. He gained international recognition through the practice of algology ( natural history ), by leading an experiment with a small mobile laboratory which presented a new classification of the respiratory epithelium, the most recognized and well-known in the sciences.  
   
 In 1836, Goudge founded the journal de la Médicale Scientifique, during the three-year period that was occupied by an outbreak of plague in Paris. It was published posthumously in 1850, and also in the French periodical Mémoires internationales, which posthumously published the Nantes Index in 1848.During his course of academic activities he wrote over 80 scientific papers, textbooks and scientific treatises.He died on 4 January 1834.

 He taught mathematics in Lowestoft until 1861, when he was appointed as tutor at the Royal School of Mines, Horsham, Surrey. He was appointed to the new chair of mathematics in 1859, but resigned in 1868, following Joseph Campbell's various failures as a mathematician. He accepted the appointment of George Pickering, chairman of the Department of Mathematics at St Andrews University, after lecturing at Horsham. Here, too, he published work on the nineteenth century, including the first volume of Rimsky-Korsakov. The first edition of his The Elements of Geometry was printed in 1880, a year before his death, in Washington, D.C., as a precursor to the new paperback editions of the classics.  
   
   
 === Queen Charlotte Church ===  
 After studying at Horsham, Smith moved to India in 1866 to do his postgraduate study in geometry at the Maharaja's School of Mines in the city of Lahore.

 = Johann Christian Thomas =  
Johann Christian Thomas, ( 23 April 1732 – 10 July 1806 ) was a German physician, botanist and naturalist, noted for his investigations of the flora and fauna of the eastern part of Europe.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Moselle, Mecklenburg ( today part of Franeker County, also Mosel, Germany ), the son of a local farmer. He studied medicine at the University of Basel, where his father had been a professor of philosophy, and at the University of Padua, where his uncle Augustin Thomas was a member of the Academy of Sciences. In 1810, Thomas entered the University of Vienna to study medicine, but soon changed courses to botany, and in the same year returned to the University to pursue his Ph.D. His doctoral thesis, Foliage in Bitterweil, was undertaken at the University of Moselle under the direction of Carl Friedrich von Meurer, and was published in two parts, the first ( Basel, 1811–1812 ), followed by further studies under Ernst Fabry in Bitterweil, ( 1813 ) and Gerrit Gezähl in Helvetia, ( 1814–1815 ).  
 In 1815, he became head of the botany department in Vienna, and in 1818 moved on to become chief scientist of the Hortus botanicum of the general plant catalog, of which he became keeper from 1819 to 1824. The naturalist Johann Christian Thomas is credited with introducing the genus of Scoloborus to Europe. In 1825 Thomas was appointed to the chair of plant pathology, in the latter capacity he dedicated it to Franz Joseph Bonhoeffer. The botanist Johann Christian Thomas was a member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences and Letters, and, after his death, honorary doctor of the Academy, even though he later opposed Bonhoeffer's medical approach to botany.  
 Thomas received many awards and honors during his career, including membership in the Grand National German Herbarium and the National Academy of Sciences. He was one of the original members of the Gesellschaft für Physik and in 1814 his name was placed among the ranks of the `` Heroes of Science '' by Alfred Rosenberg, who declared him a `` god among scientists ''. In 1822 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1825, his son, Christoph Adolf Thomas, became a professor of botany at the University of Sankt Gallerstadt, and in 1833 and 1836 was chosen to become a corresponding member of the Académie Royale de Belgique.  
 In 1824 Thomas married Erwin-Pauline Schoenck, daughter of Johann Christian Schoenck, a wealthy and influential merchant. They had one son, Ernst and five daughters : Georgina Maria ( 1850–1913 ), Caroline Elisabeth ( 1856–1947 ), Christoph Christian ( 1860–1961 ), Beatrice Rosa ( 1864–1942 ), Ella ( 1867–1895 ), Helene ( 1869–1926 ), and Bettina ( 1874–1956 ). All were eminent women scientists at the time. They were the parents of mathematician and mineralogist Johann Christian Thomas, a personal physician and friend of many distinguished scientists of the time, among them Carl Friedrich von Meurer, Henri de Lubac, Enrico Fermi, and other prominent medical figures of that era.  
 Thomas was born at 17 Jomuz Ostwicke, near Mainz.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The genus Thomasia ( family Cythraeidae ) has been named in his honor.  
 In 1835 he was appointed Botanist to the Rector of the University of Mainz and in 1849 was appointed to the chair of botany, a post he held until his death in 1806. The botanist Thomas ( botanicus ) rector, the botanist Ernst von Meurer, the mathematician Hermann von Hermann and the mineralogist Franz Wolfgang Hermann Fuchs were all named for Thomas.

Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze ( 23 June 1843 – 27 January 1907 ) was a German botanist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Otto Kuntze was born in Leipzig .   
 An apothecary in his early career , he published an essay entitled Pocket Fauna of Leipzig . Between 1863 and 1866 he worked as tradesman in Berlin and traveled through central Europe and Italy . From 1868 to 1873 he had his own factory for essential oils and attained a comfortable standard of living . Between 1874 and 1876 , he traveled around the world : the Caribbean , United States , Japan , China , South East Asia , Arabian peninsula and Egypt . The journal of these travels was published as `` Around the World '' ( 1881 ) . From 1876 to 1878 he studied Natural Science in Berlin and Leipzig and gained his doctorate in Freiburg with a monography of the genus Cinchona .   
 He edited the botanical collection from his world voyage encompassing 7,700 specimens in Berlin and Kew Gardens . The publication came as a shock to botany , since Kuntze had entirely revised taxonomy . His three-volume treatise , Revisio Generum Plantarum ( 1891 ) was widely rejected or deliberately ignored .   
 In 1886 , Kuntze visited the Russian Near East and spent the 1887–88 period on the Canary Islands . The results of both journeys became part of his main work , the Revisio . At the beginning of the 1890s he left for South America , of which he managed to see nearly all countries . In 1894 , he visited the Southern African countries as well as the German colonies . In the last years of his life , Kuntze moved permanently to Sanremo ( Italy ) .   
 Although he stated that he was merely diligently applying standard practice , his revolutionary ideas about botanic nomenclature created a schism between competing sets of Rules of Botanical Nomenclature , the precursors of the modern International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants . The conflict came to a head at the 2nd International Botanical Congress in 1905 , two years before Kuntze 's death . His uncompromising responses to differing views meant that the doors of much of the academic world , particularly in Europe , were closed to him.Kuntze 's work cast a strong light on the inadequacy of previous approaches to botanical nomenclature . A group of American botanists developed an alternative set of rules , the Rochester Code , which they proposed in 1892 as an alternative to the International Rules . This schism was not resolved until 1930 .

He later credited positive affect as being `` one of the first fully studied and analyzed factors of mental health ''. A number of such studies have been done over the past decades. One of his students was Sigmund Freud.  
 Lawrence was awarded the W. H. Davis Medal in 1935 for his work in the fields of social psychology and personality. He also received the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 for his dissertation Outline of Theory and Method for the Study of Social Behavior. Lawrence received the P.I.O. Medical Trophy in 1942, the Guggenheim Fellowship from the American Psychological Foundation in 1944, and the National Medal of Science from President Harry S. Truman in 1948.

 = W. L. Franke =  
William L. Franke, ( May 3, 1907 – May 15, 1997 ) was an American sociologist who studied women's position in society and worked as a sociologist at Harvard University. Franke's work is associated with later feminist studies of women's work and communication, but was also praised as an example of activism, lobbying for and sustained work by women in government.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Franke was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Peter Edward Franke and Ellen Frances Bosco Franke. She was educated at the Lowell Collegiate Institute. She entered Harvard University in 1947 with a minor in mathematics, and in 1948 graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology. Franke then spent two years teaching in Europe before returning to the United States, where she received her master's degree in sociology in 1950, at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.  
   
   
 === Academic career ===  
 In 1955, Franke was named a full professor at Harvard University. In 1957, she co-founded the Feminist Studies Group at Harvard as a research group. In the late 1960s, she worked as a vice president for The Institute for Research on Women in Washington, DC and as executive director of the National Women's Law Center.  
 Franke served on the research panel on the newly published The Woman's Movement : Examining the Distribution of Sources of Political Power, which sought to summarize feminist scholarship on social change. She also published a book in 1969, Don't Call It Violence, which challenged the feminist gender norms regarding the term `` domestic violence '' in popular media. She co-wrote a report for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on the Progress of Women in the United States which concluded that women would soon no longer have the option of always having to satisfy the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. In 1972 she joined the faculty at Columbia University. After being on the editorial board for Women and Power since the 1960s, she retired from Columbia University in 1977.  
   
   
 == Research area ==  
 Franke worked at two other major American universities, Boston College and Georgetown University. She was the principal of the Eastman School of Public Policy.  
 Franke served as chair of the U.S. Department of Commerce from 1959 to 1969, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was also a trustee of the Eastern State Women's Center.In 1975, Franke served as the inaugural dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, and remained with the school as principal until her retirement in 1987.She was appointed the Dean of Columbia University's School of Public Administration and also, from 1970 to 1978, President of the Women's Business Association, an organization based in New York City.Along with Lynn Aronson and Susan Brown Sherbrook, Franke served on the Women's Political Caucus ( WPC ).In the 1980s and 1990s, Franke argued that the Pentagon was mostly responsible for U.S. and NATO nuclear development. She claimed that the Soviet Union's `` robust capability of developing nuclear weapons and its liquidation programs were what enabled a technologically superior and non-nuclearized, non-nuclearizing Nazi regime to see his Nazi party become the dominant European political power ''.  
 In the 1990s, Franke and her former associate Lynn Aronson focused on nonviolence education as an adjunct of feminism.

Carsten Schor ( 5 April 1824 in Oldenburg, near Eshkol – 20 March 1885 in Berlin ) was a German botanist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Carsten Schor was born in Oldenburg, close to the Eshkol region in what is now southern Poland. In the year 1844, he graduated from the Reformed Theological Seminary in Prague and had to leave because of the separation of his family. In 1846, he went to Göttingen and from there to Berlin where he worked as a teacher of natural history for a short time. In 1847 he married Hannah Sondersam.  
   
 In 1857, he returned to Oldenburg where he died in a typhoid fever. In 1884, his plant collection was purchased by the Botanical Society of Berlin. The collection was donated to the German Flora Society and also by the East Saxon National Heritage Office.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Schor wrote over 150 scientific works. His studies are mostly on the Lepidoptera. Schor's work, however, is not confined to Lepidoptera. He also collected Mantis mantis, Karyophyllum sylvaticum, Hygrocybe intrissoides and Rhizostomus uranicum.

 = Otto von Jakob Fünffig =  
Otto von Jakob Fünffig ( 14 December 1733 in Bürenheim – 7 March 1834 ) was a German writer. He was a son of the pastor and theologian Johann Ludwig von Fünffig ( 1715–1779 ).  
 In 1752 Fünffig emigrated from Vienna, where his father was a professor of theology. He went to Göttingen, where he became pastor of a mixed church. He became the first German Protestant to assume the supreme position in August-September 1757 in Haügen. In 1760 he obtained a parish priestcy in Königsberg. From 1761 until his death, he served as a pastor and also as schoolmaster, and also as the first provost and first dean of the University of Bonn.In 1763 he became a schoolmaster in Bonn. In 1764, he was appointed rector at his native city. From 1764 until 1780 he was a professor of theology at the University of Bonn. In 1765, Fünffig became active in various liberal reform movements of the first part of the 19th century, while his religious theology became much more conservative. In the city, he was a principal supporter of the liberal reformist aspirations of his teacher Max Müller ( 1712–1782 ) and the social reformer Hermann von Helmuth von Helmuths ( 1720–1788 ). In 1785 he became associated with Frederick the Great's Opium War, and of the military campaign which caused the capitulation of Dresden. In 1805, he became one of the founders of the Stiftkreuz Forum in Frankfurt.  
 The Principality of Kürn ( Lower Saxony ) was granted to him by the military governor Hanns Freiherr von Dechen in 1784 after its secession from Germany. He served as rector from 1801 to 1814 in Berlin.  
 He died in Leipzig.

David William Mitchell ( 4 August 1813 – 1 November 1859 ) was an English zoologist and illustrator .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
    
 Mitchell was born in Chalfont St. Peter , Buckinghamshire . He graduated from Christ Church , Oxford , in 1836.Residing in Bloomsberry Terrace , London , he married Prudence Philips Willes , eldest daughter of the Rev 'd Edward Willes of Walcot , near Bath , Somerset on 30 October 1837.Mitchell illustrated George Robert Gray 's Genera of Birds , but finding himself too busy with his work for the ZSL , he employed the German illustrator Joseph Wolf as his assistant on the project.Mitchell was elected into the Linnean Society of London in November 1843 . Mitchell was the first paid secretary of the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) , taking up the post between 10 February 1847 and 6 April 1859 , instigating the construction of the first public marine aquarium in the Regent 's Park Zoological Gardens , which opened on 22 May 1853 . He is credited with rescuing the London zoo financially by publishing attractive images of a few `` star '' animals , thus greatly increasing the number of visitors in the late 1840s.Mitchell was a collector and dealer in skins and eggs , and for a time lived in Penzance , Cornwall.Resigning his post as secretary of the ZSL on 6 April 1859 , he became Aquarium Director of the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris , but died on 1 November 1859 ( shot himself ) , only months after taking up the position , and was succeeded there by William Alford Lloyd .

Rudolf Hermann Arndt Kohlrausch ( November 6 , 1809 in Göttingen – March 8 , 1858 in Erlangen ) was a German physicist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was a native of Göttingen , the son of the Royal Hanovarian director general of schools Friedrich Kohlrausch . He was a high-school teacher of mathematics and physics successively at Lüneburg , Rinteln , Kassel and Marburg . In 1853 he became an associate professor at the University of Marburg , and four years later , a full professor of physics at the University of Erlangen .   
    
    
 == Research ==   
 In 1854 Kohlrausch introduced the relaxation phenomena , and used the stretched exponential function to explain relaxation effects of a discharging Leyden jar ( capacitor ) . In 1856 , with Wilhelm Weber ( 1804–1891 ) , he demonstrated that the ratio of electrostatic to electromagnetic units produced a number that matched the value of the then known speed of light . This finding was instrumental towards Maxwell 's conjecture that light is an electromagnetic wave . Also , the first usage of the letter `` c '' to denote the speed of light was published in an 1856 paper by Kohlrausch and Weber .

 = William Nicol (geologist) =   
Dr William Nicol FRSE FCS ( 18 April 1770 – 2 September 1851 ) was a Scottish geologist and physicist who invented the Nicol prism , the first device for obtaining plane-polarized light , in 1828 .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Nicol was born in Humbie ( East Lothian ) in 1770 , the son of Walter Nicol and Marion Fowler . According to the parish register , he was baptised on 18 April 1770 . Some sources ( including his gravestone ) give his date of birth as 1766 .   
    
    
 == Lecturer ==   
 He started out as aide to his uncle , Henry Moyes , an itinerant lecturer in Natural Philosophy whose blindness necessitated assistance for his chemistry and optics demonstrations . Nicol , having himself become a popular lecturer on that subject at the University of Edinburgh , settled in Edinburgh to live a very retired life . He conducted extensive studies of fluid inclusions in crystals and the microscopic structure of fossil wood . He did not publish any of his research findings until 1826 .   
    
    
 == Nicol prism ==   
    
 Nicol made his prism by bisecting a parallelepiped of Iceland spar ( a naturally occurring , transparent crystalline form of calcium carbonate ) along its shortest diagonal , then cementing the two halves together with Canada balsam . Light entering the prism is refracted into two rays , one of which emerges as plane-polarized light . Nicol prisms greatly facilitated the study of refraction and polarization , and were later used to investigate molecular structures and optical activity of organic compounds .   
    
    
 == Rock sections ==   
 In 1815 , Nicol developed a method of preparing extremely thin sections of crystals and rocks for microscopical study . He hit upon the plan of cutting sections of fossil wood , so as to reveal its minutest vegetable structures under a microscope . He took a slice from the specimen to be studied , ground it perfectly flat , polished it , and cemented it by means of Canada balsam to a piece of plate-glass . The exposed surface of the slice was then ground down , until the piece of stone was reduced to a thin pellicle adhering to the glass , and the requisite degree of transparency was obtained . His technique made it possible to view mineral samples by transmitted rather than reflected light and therefore enabled the minerals ' internal structures to be seen . Nicol prepared a large number of slices of fossil and recent woods . Many of these were described by Henry Witham in his Observations of Fossil Vegetables ( 1831 ) , to which Nicol supplied the first published account of the process.When Nicol died , his instruments and preparations passed to Alexander Bryson , who made many additions to the collections and made numerous thin slices of minerals and rocks for the purpose of exhibiting the cavities containing fluid , which had been described long before by David Brewster and Nicol .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 He died at his home , 4 Inverleith Terrace in Edinburgh ( now renumbered 12 Inverleith Terrace ) on the 2 September 1851 , and was buried in Warriston Cemetery . His burial site is now marked by a plaque on the east wall , north of the sealed eastern gate .   
 Dorsum Nicol on the Moon is named after him .

 = Alice Yancey Gordon =  
Alice Yancey Gordon ( born Alice Olive Marshon ; 19 November 1898 – 10 February 1990 ) was an American anthropologist, feminist, and researcher, and the chief designer and principle administrator of the Sisterhood of Sister Meters. Gordon was born in New York City, New York, the daughter of Wilson Hill Marshon and Jeannie Jordan. She was raised as a Methodist and taught in a church when she was 18. She was also trained as a physician at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.  
 In 1917 she married Ervin E. Gordon. They had six children, and an extensive network of neighbors, associates, and students, and eventually developed the Sister Meters as a lifelong institution. At the time, many women did not share the commitment to the mission in a remote and distant part of the world, and many did not attend public schools, leaving them the responsibility of domestic helpers and paralegals. In order to secure academic and professional degrees, Yancey Gordon turned to her sister's mission. The Sisters of Sister Meters taught women, who were otherwise lost to society, the ways of working, living and doing. The public movement took off and was quite successful as of 1942, when approximately 300,000 individuals had joined the organization. At that time there were forty cities and nearly 15 million adherents. In 1949 Sister Meters made its official debut at Ithaca College when it began with in-service celebrations, lectures, a lecture by Elsie Goddard, and readings by Joseph Welchnoe, St. Paul Williamson, and Sam Dagen, as well as presentations by Betty Friedan and Elizabeth Gellhorn.In 1951, Sister Meters took over from Sister Catholic at Holy Name Roman Catholic Church in Bexar County, Texas, which became the country's first Sisters of Sister Meters Catholic Church. The building is located near the main campus of Fayetteville State College.  
 Gordon graduated from the University of Chicago in 1942, and from Harvard Divinity School in 1945. She taught at Tufts University in Boston and received degrees in psychology from the University of Oklahoma in 1947 and from the University of New Mexico in 1950. Gordon completed her doctoral studies at Yale University in 1953. She became a faculty member at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1958.

 = Jean Marie DeMarquise =  
Jean Marie-Eugène DeMarquise ( 1 December 1812 – 22 July 1870 ) was a French photographer, amateur naturalist, and illustrator.  
 DeMarquise made important photographs of the great naturalists of the late 18th century. His successful full-length prints of both species were printed in at least 10 special editions in the 1890s, and became significant in the photographic revival of the early 20th century.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Childhood and education ===  
 DeMarquise was born in Sainte-Léonard-des-Prémaux ( Santià della Morceau ), Corsica. His father was an amateur painter, woodcarver and lithographer. The home début was a local circus where he went to amuse himself.  
   
   
 === Professional life ===  
 He studied drawing and painting, at the École nationale supérieure d'histoire naturelle, Paris, and became a pupil of Gustave Gillet. In 1850 he established himself as a solo artist with a mostly professional artistic career. His work in landscape and portrait illustrations was accompanied by scientific research about the flora and fauna of Corsica and Africa.  
   
   
 === Wanderings ===  
   
 DeMarquise collected and developed large collections of forest trees and other exotic plants. Among his most well-known works are the famous prints for the  
 1893 Camille Saint-Saëns classic of the same name. In July 1889 DeMarquise accompanied Saint-Saëns on a four-month expedition through the tropics, when, upon reaching Venezuela and then the Guayaquil desert, he abandoned his camera and set up his camera equipment in the Natura, the oldest indigenous home in the town. DeMarquise's studio was devoted to his flora, which was the center of his artistic life. This project is now often regarded as the beginning of a decades-long association between nature and art.  
   
   
 === Relocation ===  
 As a result of his ornithological work, in 1902 DeMarquise decided to relocate to Mérida, to which he was then destined for the next 50 years. He suffered as a result. His wife died in 1917, and his other children left his village. The family lived in exile in Mérida, where he spent the rest of his life.

 = Pablo Astruc (Philosopher) =  
Pablo Astruc ( September 15, 1927 – January 2, 2002 ) was a philosopher, humanist and the founder of postmodern philosophy, and a world-renowned classical music critic.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Astruc was born in Argentina to an ethnic Armenian family. He earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1954 from the University of Buenos Aires. He studied philosophy at Universidad Autónoma de México, where he obtained his doctorate in 1978. Since then, Astruc was a renowned philosopher and in 1977 became a Reader of philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires. Astruc's views on philosophy, especially his rejection of sui generis cognitive knowledge, led to some controversy. He was most notable for his books Critique of Modern Philosophy ( 1984 ), Criticism of the Modern City ( 1992 ), Critique of Modern Art ( 1993 ) and History of Modern Philosophy ( 1995 ). Astruc advocated for a historical critical view of history, for the reappraising of classical philosophy.  
 In 1980, he became editor of the journal Philosophia seminarorum ( Philosophy Seminar ). A number of prominent historical philosophers, including Carl Scheler, Guido Schmitt, David Henderson, Frank Peirce, John Dewey, Harold M. Chalmers, Thomas Hobbes, and J. B. S. Haldane, he influenced were to write books on this theme.He died in 2001 of pancreatic cancer.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Astruc's main book, Critique of Modern Philosophy, argued that critical thinking should be open and participatory, that it seeks `` to find on the ground what is important '', and in particular that it should search for `` the deep-seated myth of identity ''. (... ) Such a myth can no longer be entertained by any rational author.The book developed `` a fundamental critique of Plato and Aristotle, of Kant, Hegel, and his allies, who argued for idealist values that led us to trouble-shoot thoroughly the ontological basis of society, instead of proceeding from the abstract analysis of the actual situation, dealing with its origins and consequences. '' It argued for the replacement of the realism of historical materialism with `` ontological materialism ''. Astruc said that `` ( we ) need to atone for our flippantness for `` wanting answers that could 'be understood '', i.e., problems that might make out our position as idealist. `` For another of Astruc's books, The Meaning of Reality, he argued that `` being reality itself, physics and culture are fundamentally unlike any other scientific field.... They need to be seen to serve our very survival, not some vague aspiration to a pure and simply perfect body of knowledge. '' Also for another of Astruc's books, Expression and Reality ( 1988 ), which he called `` the philosophical basis of existentialism, epistemology, and aesthetics '', he held that reality itself should stand behind human thought, philosophy and science. Also for another of Astruc's books, The Right to be Free ( 1993 ), he argued that freedom is not only the duty of individuals, but also that it belongs to all human beings.For more, see List of works by Pablo Astruc.Of particular note is Astruc's 1996 book Criticism of the Modern City, a critical synthesis of postmodernism and classical aesthetics. According to Campbell Clark, `` Astruc's concern was with the most prosaic problem in contemporary life : the clash between a novelistic view of the world with the non-literary conception of history. It was a novelistic view that was doing serious harm to some small but growing numbers of well-educated, middle-class Argentineans, and Astruc's account of that clash was a fitting antidote for the naïve, often despairing attitude that really counts for more in contemporary world history than any individual's particular life circumstances. `` He also wrote the short story `` Note da Pío, '' which was read in an English-language festival in New York City in 2005.  
 Astruc wrote about the problems of domination in a popular culture in a book The New Aristotelianism.

 = Hippolyte Cuvier =  
Hippolyte Jean-Louis Cuvier ( 2 March 1816, Vendôme – 9 May 1879, Paris ) was a French and Russian physicist who made the first measurements of magnetic fields in the atmosphere in the period of 1861–1866, and also studied solar radiation.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Vendôme, the son of Jean and Joanne Marie-Édouard Marie-Hubert Cuvier. After his father's death, the family moved to Paris, where Hippolyte attended school in the Marais and studied physics at the École des Mines from 1846 until 1853. In 1854, he was admitted to the physics department of the École polytechnique, where he remained until 1861. After joining the École polytechnique, he worked in 1871 in Geneva, starting his studies of the properties of gases. In 1872, he became head of the Bureau des Elephants du Turin, and the following year took up the chair of relativity at the University of Paris. He returned to Paris in 1873, became director of the Royal Observatory of Europe and occupied a position in the Board of Education of the University. In 1876, he published La Cour de l'usage ( on the surface of a magnetic field ). From 1886 to 1896, Cuvier was a professor of physics at the Ecole polytechnique, and died of apoplexy on 9 May 1879, age 50.  
   
   
 == Scientific achievements ==  
 His contributions to experimental physics include the measurement of magnetic field with a reflection tube, and the Cuvier equation of planetary motion. In 1873, he invented the classical magneto-mechanical scale, which has been known as the Cuvier scale. In 1874, he suggested the idea that the type of metals in an electron's path was the only determinant of its motion. Cuvier was also an early astronomer, pointing out several asteroids in 1869 that were crescent-shaped in the opposite sign of the ecliptic.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 In 1872, Cuvier published a large text of mathematical analysis with applications to electrical systems and was appointed professor of electrical and mechanical engineering at the university of the Neuchâtel. In 1889, the École polytechnique awarded him the Prix de Rome and awarded him the Order of Leopold ( Knight Commander of the Legion of Honor ) in 1892, and the Marie Curie medal in 1904. In 1914, he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

 = Victor Karl Danilevskii =  
Victor Karl Danilevskii ( also spelled Danilo, Danili, Danilek ; born November 23, 1925, St. Petersburg – died April 12, 2000, Moscow ) was a Soviet mathematician.  
 From 1953 to 1968, he worked for the Research Institute of Science of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1964, he was a Russian Academy of Sciences researcher. After he left the Academy, he worked in the field of software development. He co-founded `` software analyzer '' group. From 1989 he was head of the Department of Mathematics at the State Institute of Mathematics, Moscow. He won the Leningrad Award in 1993.  
 In 2004, the Moscow State University's State Academy of Sciences awarded him the title of physicist-in-residence. Since 1996 he served as chairman of the `` Department of Mathematics, CAST '', which is dedicated to scientific research in applied mathematics. The `` Russkaya Socivodnik '' magazine named him as a member of the `` State Academy of Sciences. ''  
 In 1999 he received the Order of the Badge of the Red Banner of Labor.  
 In June 2016, the `` Kremlin Commemoration '' of `` St. Petersburg, Soviet Union '' on his grave in the cemetery in Allushkina was proclaimed by the Interior Ministry.In the Russian newspaper Svoboda he wrote : `` If someone wanted to find my ideals of using a machine to measure all dynamics of extremely small problems, this situation and how Danilevskii not only started this task can be known to him : OK, let's listen to what works. Here comes something special. This is a machine that can solve this problem, that is to say, he helped pioneer the advancement of the problem of liquid crystals. His decisive step in this goal was very easy : he just used the greatest practical machine ( for instance, a toy turbo-converter ). This was nothing special, but nevertheless it was done to a very strong and most simple mechanical conclusion. How brilliant! ''  
   
   
 == Works ==  
   
 In the course of the 1936–1949 he worked on the hypothesis of quadratic group properties. In 1938, he constructed an orthogonal group, which was the first non-kriging orthogonal group. In the following year, he completed another group which became the basis of the project on mergesort invariants for orthogonal groups. In 1957, the result of his thesis about solvable solver for orthogonal groups was proved. In 1958, he obtained one of the first results on the number of triples which are equal to ( π/2, π ). He discovered the suspension principle of pentagons, and in 1964 proved that a bipartite plane with ( R, R ) plane of rationals perpendicular to each other has a normal, say, area equal to the quantity that is the sum of the surface area of the plane and the surface area of an ordinary polygon.  
   
 Danilevskii also worked on the proof of the composition of a p-algebraoid in solution of the algebraic group problem. This group was the basis for later groups in classical algebras. He used generalised Richardson's methods to prove properties of polynomials on topologies and homotopy classes. Also in the context of certain solvable solver he demonstrated the value of a polynomial over the recurrence field ( Chebyshev rule ).  
 In 1958–59, his major work was published on linear algebraic functions and proof of integrals. This series contains the most famous paper, in which he proved Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1962, he gave the classic postulate of equivariant calculus. He also did work on error theory, including the unsolved problems in Poisson curve approximation.  
 Danilevskii continued in an important line of work involving properties of commutative rings. For example, the optical lines of commutative rings with congruent for all the coefficients of the ring are associated to a characteristic continuum in a continuum space. His most important work concerns the analysis of continuum morphisms of commutative rings. He pioneered the concept of linkage of rings in continuum space.

 Graves was born in Wandsworth, London. He was educated at West High School, a reputable private school. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, at 16 where he excelled in maths. Graves received a D.Phil. in 1948 for his work as a Classics scholar.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Graves was appointed C.V. by Oriel College, Oxford, in 1948. Thereafter he taught history, mathematics and classics at the school. He later became the Dean of the Faculty of Theology, to which was allocated the Dean of Arts and Droitwich. During his tenure he brought in both new and outgoing classes of humanities scholars.Graves also became the first professor of English to assume the position of head of a graduate degree at the college, where William Hutton Gibson was Professor of Classics in 1952, with the post-graduate certificate Graves served for his contribution to the College as Chancellor of the College.In 1959, Graves became the first Head of the department to make an immediate recovery after the collapse of the British radio band. His policy is to maintain full competition among courses, to present programmes that the institution thought were popular, and to make sure that students are not forced to choose a class that has not been offered in the last few years.  
 In 1964, Oriel College was restored, now part of Oriel College of the City of London, and Graves was appointed Provost of the college. From 1971 to 1972, he was the Provost. He chaired the Librarians'Conference, which he helped organise. In that capacity, he and Jane Drumm were involved in the opposition to the New Entomological Year in 1971, which would have reduced it to a four-week celebration of British entomology. The plan for the new year was to extend the focus to other parts of the world and set a schedule to meet the need for better entomological research in India, Bhutan, and the Baltics.During the Second World War, he served as Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ). Thereafter, Graves became a staunch opponent of any form of nuclear disarmament.Graves was President of the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954-1955.  
   
   
 == Family life ==  
 In 1966, Graves married Felicity Jane Faulkner, a former pupil at Oriel. They had four daughters and five sons, including Evan. Evan Graves was killed in a car accident in Cambridge in 1964. Another son, David, became a professor of urban studies.

 = Heinz Tiessen =   
Richard Gustav Heinz Tiessen ( 10 April 1887 – 29 November 1971 ) was a German composer .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Tiessen was born at Königsberg , where he studied with composer Erwin Kroll before moving to Berlin . There , he enrolled at Humboldt University and at the Stern'sches Konservatorium , where he studied composition and music theory . He worked as a music critic for Allgemeine Musikzeitung from 1911 to 1917 before becoming a theater Kapellmeister and composer for Volksbühne in 1918 . From 1920 to 1922 , he conducted the Akademische Orchester and between 1925 and 1945 , he taught music theory and composition at the Berliner Musikhochschule . He also co-founded the German division of the International Society for Contemporary Music and served as conductor of the Junger Chor . During the Third Reich , his music was classified as `` undesirable '' by the Nazi authorities , and after World War II , he almost completely stopped composing . From 1946 to 1949 he directed the city Konservatorium and beginning in 1955 , he headed the department of composition and theory at the Berliner Musikhochschule . His best-known pupils were Eduard Erdmann and Sergiu Celibidache . He died in Berlin .   
 Tiessen composed two symphonies , a dance drama and incidental music for a number of plays , some Music for String Orchestra , a Totentanz-Suite for small orchestra , chamber works , pieces for piano and organ , lieder , and choral music . The music of Richard Strauss , who in 1917 had helped Tiessen obtain a job at the Berlin State Opera , influenced much of his early works : the First Symphony is dedicated to Strauss . From 1918 onwards his musical idiom inclined more towards an individual form of Expressionism , to which his many theatre scores contributed in evolving a highly dramatic , free-form style .

Tina Keller-Jenny ( born June 17 , 1887 in Schwanden , Switzerland , died October 25 , 1985 in Geneva ) was a Swiss physician and Jungian psychotherapist who witnessed firsthand the development of analytical psychology during its formative years .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Tina Keller was the daughter of Swiss industrialist Conrad Jenny , and grew up at the Jenny-Castle , in Thalwil , Switzerland . In 1912 she married the theologian Adolf Keller and was mother of five children . Tina Keller completed many years of analysis with C.G.Jung and Toni Wolff ( 1915–1928 ) , who discovered movement as active imagination . She completed medical school in 1931 , and practiced as a psychiatrist and Jungian-oriented psychotherapist . She was one of the first women in Switzerland to found a psychiatric Jungian practice . Keller-Jenny was one of the pioneers in integrating analysis with body-based approaches such as movement and dance , which has since become a major element in the field of body-sensitive analysis . A Therapy largely unknown until the 1950s when rediscovered by Marian Chace and therapist Mary Whitehouse . Whitehouse later became a dancer and dance teacher having studied with Martha Graham and Mary Wigma.After the death of her husband Adolf Keller in 1963 , Tina Keller worked in a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles together with Trudi Schoop . Schoop was a dance therapist , dancer and comedian . Back in Switzerland , she was asked to speak on the 10th anniversary of C.G.Jung death . She was by then the last surviving collaborators of C.G.Jung 's early years . Until her old age , Tina Keller made therapies , including her grandnephew and painter Daniel Garbade . She wrote books and theses , and died 98 years old in 1985 in Geneva .

In 1920 he began work in the chemistry department at the University of Freiburg, where he served as the director from 1929 to 1935. From 1926 to 1928 he was a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Freiburg, where from 1929 to 1933 he was the Head of the Chemistry Department.  
 Reinhardt was a pioneer of the study of solid state and field theory. In 1919 he was awarded the Gesellschaft für die Physik und Aerodynamik ( Gold Medal of the Institute for the Science of Physics ). In the same year he obtained his doctorate in the University of Leipzig. Reinhardt and Nils Fransson are the first to set up the Schwabe oxygen deprivation experiments at the Leipzig University.  
 Reinhardt pioneered the theory of what is now called Reinhardt functions. These functions can describe the behavior of an artificial quark, a quark in a leptonide monomers, or a granular quark, which ultimately turned out to be the subatomic structure of the neutrino, the quark fermion.Reinhardt ’ s experimental set-up of an artificial hyperfine structure was able to explain and illustrate the ultimate functional properties of the quark ; the Leyden flask experiment was carried out under his supervision at Leipzig.

He authored Extraits du Dictionnaire universel d'histoire naturelle . In 1845 , in the Dictionnaire , he coined the expression `` theory of the evolution of organized beings '' . Science historian Goulven Laurent argued that Gérard was the first to propose a clear scientific theory of evolution ( 1844-1845 ) , and that he used the term `` evolution '' rather than transformism . By evolution , Gérard was referring to transformation of species over time by direct pressure from a changing environment .

 = Bernard Davis (biologist) =   
Bernard David Davis ( January 7 , 1916 – January 14 , 1994 ) was an American biologist who made major contributions in microbial physiology and metabolism . Davis was a prominent figure at Harvard Medical School in microbiology and in national science policy . He was the 1989 recipient of the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology from the National Academy of Sciences .   
    
    
 == Education ==   
 Davis was born in Franklin , Massachusetts , where his parents , Jewish immigrants from Lithuania , had settled . ( Davis himself was nonobservant , and `` insisted on atheism '' . ) He was valedictorian at his high school , then attended Harvard University , where he majored in biochemistry . After earning his Bachelor of Science degree , he enrolled at Harvard Medical School , graduating in 1940 with a rare M.D. , summa cum laude . He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958 . In a front-note to a posthumously published commentary that appeared in 2000 , the major contributions of Davis to microbial physiology has been noted as , `` the use of penicillin for the selection of auxotrophic mutants and his U-tube experiment to prove that bacterial conjugation required direct contact between the two bacterial strains . ''   
    
    
 == Moralistic fallacy ==   
 In a short article published in Nature in 1978 , Davis coined the term `` moralistic fallacy '' after calls for ethical guidelines to control the study of what could allegedly become `` dangerous knowledge . '' The term was intended as a converse to the naturalistic fallacy , a term coined by G.E . Moore in the early twentieth century but often applied to certain related views of David Hume in the eighteenth century . Hume pointed out the logical fallacy that occurs when deductive reasoning jumps from statements about what is to prescriptions about what ought to be . Davis thus referred to the `` moralistic fallacy '' as `` in effect , an illogical effort to derive an 'is ' from an 'ought ' . ''   
 Sometimes a theory is rejected with a reference to the danger of misuse . In doing so , one fails to differentiate sufficiently clearly between its epistemological value and its practical value , or between the moral , value-free knowledge and – in consideration of moral valuations – the potentially negative consequences of the knowledge . From a perspective of scientific theory , the accuracy of a theory is relevant , not its practical value , its origin or history of use . No theory is protected against misuse , nor can a theory be falsified by misuse . Both misuse as well as renunciation of knowledge can have disadvantageous consequences .   
 An example of the naturalistic fallacy would be approving of all wars if scientific evidence showed warfare was part of human nature , whereas an example of the moralistic fallacy would be claiming that , because warfare is wrong , it can not be part of human nature .   
    
    
 == On scientific writing ==   
 On the current format of scientific writing , Davis had opined , `` A scientific paper is an unusual art form . It has to be as compact as possible , while giving the reader all the information needed to repeat the experiments . Because the literature is vast , the format of a paper is standardized so the reader can quickly find the parts that interest him ; readers skim most of the papers that they look at , except those very close to their interests . The aim is efficient , impersonal transmission of the essentials , rather than a narrative account of the steps along the way . ''

 = David Iosifovich Grossman =  
David Joseph Grossman ( December 3, 1901 – July 14, 1980 ) was a noted American mathematician and physicist. He also became one of the world's leading mathematicians of his era, as well as a noted performer and a player in Hollywood.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
   
 David Grossman was born on December 3, 1901, to French parents in New York City, the son of Paul Grossman, a physician, and his wife Sallie Brande Baron-Sébastien. He was educated at New York University and the City College of New York, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1925, the highest honor awarded to a student in that school. From 1926 to 1928, he received a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from Columbia University.  
 In 1930, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an electrical engineer. Upon his graduation from MIT in 1932, he became a full professor at Caltech in 1937 and, subsequently, was promoted to full professor in 1943, becoming Director of the National Bureau of Standards in 1942 and Cofounder of the National Institute of Standards in 1943.  
   
   
 === Film career ===  
 Grossman directed, among other films, the 1933 film Plane Crazy ( an adaptation of French theoretical physicist Émile Durkheim's We Make the Sky ) and two short films : Cradle To Grave ( 1944 ) and The Grey Lady ( 1944 ), both about the nature of suicide in American childhood. The former, based on Ernst Haeckel's memoirs, was filmed in the New Jersey suburbs, where he lived for most of his life.  
 The latter was set in remote and isolated Appalachian caves, and was based on the 1947 play The Blue Man of Fancy. The latter, based on the fictional story of the author's son, Maurice, was based on the 1949 play Black Lips. Both films starred Samuel West as the title character and drew criticism from both the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) and the director Roy Rogers for displaying the very essence of the moviewright's sentiments : the film was `` an absolute triumph of trying and failing to be unreal ''. 
 Grossman was a noted actor. In The Grey Lady, he played the title role, the illegitimate son of the father of the protagonist's twin. The film's success made it possible for him to relocate to the United States. He was in contract at the time of his death to direct the 1963 version of Crash ( intended to recapture his strong reputation as a screenwriter ), but it was not a success.  
   
   
 == Oscar recognition and endorsement ==  
 In 1927, after attending the first international technical congress in his native Switzerland, Grossman won the election to the American Physical Society. His acceptance speech contained a set of syntheses of A. N. T. Peierls's and John von Neumann's ideas about the field of information theory, much of which was much in agreement with his own, and suggested that a fully quantum theory could be of use in computational physics. The speech had a profound effect on Grossman's scientific future and on the scientific literature on quantum theory.

 = Antonina Prikhot 27ko =   
Antonina Fedorovna Prikhot'ko ( April 26 , 1906 in Pyatigorsk , Russia – September 29 , 1995 in Kiev , Ukraine ) , was a Russian-born Ukrainian Soviet experimental physicist . She was an Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and is known for her fundamental contributions to the condensed matter spectroscopy .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Prikhot'ko was accepted to the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute in 1923 and graduated in 1929 . Still as a Junior , she started research on spectroscopy under the supervision of Ivan V. Obreimov , and finally earned a PhD in this field under his guidance . In 1930 , she moved to the newly established Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology for working with Obreimov on low-temperature spectroscopy of molecular crystals , a field pioneered by him , in the first in the USSR cryogenic laboratory created by Lev Shubnikov . This research was primary focused on comparing the spectra of vapors and crystals of weakly interacting molecules that at low temperature manifest a number of narrow bands due to the freezing-out the thermal motion of molecules . In this way Obreimov and Prikhot'ko investigated a wide class of inorganic and organic molecular crystals and detected optically low-temperature transitions between their different phases . The principal technical advances were in taking absorption spectra in polarized light and measuring dispersion , including the anomalous dispersion near the absorption lines , at low temperatures . During WWII Prikhot'ko worked in the city of Ufa where a number of Institutions of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was evacuated . Since 1944 Prikhot'ko worked in Kiev , in the Institute of Physics , where here husband , a prominent Soviet nuclear physicist Aleksandr Leipunskii , was appointed as a Director . There she established a Division of the Physics of Crystals .   
 The principal discovery of Prikhot'ko was published in her 1944 paper based on the experimental data collected still in Kharkov , and in her 1948 follow-up paper . She reported the discovery in the absorption spectra of monocrystals of naphthalene two new bands that were polarized along the symmetry axes of the crystal , as distinct from the majority of bands that there present in both components of the spectrum at the same frequencies . Because individual molecules in crystalline naphthalene are tilted with respect to the crystal axes , existence of strongly polarized absorption bands proved unambiguously that electronic excitation is not localized at individual molecules but propagates across the crystal . Prikhot'ko ' discovery stimulated development of Davydov ' theory of molecular excitons for crystals including several molecules in a unit cell . While existence of excitons was predicted previously by Yakov Frenkel and afterwards by Gregory Wannier and Nevill Mott , Prikhot'ko ' was the first convincing experimental discovery of excitons . The follow-up experiments on low-temperature spectra of benzine crystals confirmed agreement between the theory and experiment .   
 During the following years Prikhot'ko and her collaborators investigated spectra of a number of crystals , and her personal favorite has been crystalline oxygen where electronic excitations combine with magnetic ones .   
 Since 1965 Prikhot'ko served as a Director of the Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine . She was awarded a Lenin prize for her scientific achievements and a title of a Hero of Socialist Labor .

 = Pablo Turpin =  
Pablo Turpin ( August 7, 1911 – March 20, 2000 ) was an Argentine physicist, important for his work on infrared spectroscopy, crystallography and color discrimination. He was also a pioneering rationalist and élite theorist.  
 Turpin's own father was a descendant of Spanish conquerors of Veracruz in the time of Francisco de Rojas and another ancestor of the banker Manuel de Castro y Amerigo y Almeida, who was a founding member of the New Spain. Turpin was born in Isabela, who was called Chegaju-Gran, but used Turpin as the last name of his surname. After graduating from the University of Buenos Aires, he enrolled in the faculty of physics in 1923. Turpin taught briefly at the Pontifical Military Academy.  
 In 1938, the Berlin Government enacted legislation which classified science from the academic fields of mechanics and metallurgy into two national zones. This restricted research and allowed only teachers to pursue their specialties. That year, the government finally abolished this law, but provided Turpin with a special exemption allowing him to continue working in the Buenos Aires Scientific Community. After this he returned to Argentina and took up the post of the director of the Institute of Physics of the University of Buenos Aires, later known as the Universidad Cervantes. At this time, he worked on pioneering spectral lines and wrote a series of important papers on the calibration of spectroscopic instruments. He developed color recognition tests for the color vision of children.  
 In 1949 he married Valeria Teoh, a native of Ríocelo. The same year he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Buenos Aires. His main contributions were to the self-model of spectroscopy and for the design of the radiometric spectrograph.Turbin died in Buenos Aires, aged 86, but left a small number of letters to his students. Among these were a selection of letters in which he expressed his appreciation of the timely publications of the university and the Argentine scientific community, particularly that of George Gamow and Alfred Keacke, and their contributions to the promotion of international research.

 = Pietro Maria Gazzaniga =   
Pietro Maria Gazzaniga ( 3 March 1722 at Bergamo , Italy – 11 December 1799 at Vicenza ) was an Italian Dominican theologian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 At a very early age he entered the Order of St. Dominic , and studied the various branches of ecclesiastical sciences , especially philosophy and theology . He was then , despite his youth , appointed to teach philosophy and church history , first in the various houses of his order and later at the University of Bologna .   
 The University of Vienna had in 1760 a vacancy for the chair of dogmatic theology , which had been assigned exclusively to members of the Dominican Order . The Empress Maria Theresa appealed to Gazzaniga 's superiors to have him transferred . At his feet sat the Empress herself , Cardinal Migazzi , and Garampi ; and Pope Pius VI , during his sojourn in Vienna , attended his lectures . After twenty years he returned to Italy , where he continued to lecture in various places until his death .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 In theology Gazzaniga was a leading defender and exponent of the Thomistic school during the eighteenth century . By strict adherence to the traditional teaching of his school , he set himself against the spirit of his age , which sought to modernize and to conduct all theological schools of Austria on plans designed to render them more independent of ecclesiastical and royal authority . He succeeded in winning over to his cause Simon Rock , till then an associate of Gerard van Swieten , the promoter of the Jansenist spirit in Austria , and with his assistance restored Thomism in the schools . His fidelity to Aquinas likewise rendered him very bitter against Molinism ; so much so , in fact , that he succeeded in persuading Gomarist Calvinists , as against the Arminians , to subscribe to the Thomistic doctrine of predestination and reprobation ( ad sanam Thomistarum de predestinations et reprobatione doctrinam descenderunt , Proelect. , vol . II , diss . 6 , n. 242 ) .   
 His principal work , the `` Praelectiones theologicae habitae in vindobonensi universitate , nunc vero alio methodo dispositae , emendatae et auctae '' , went through many editions ( 9 vols. , Bologna , 1788–1793 ; Bassani , 1831 ) .

Horace O. Bell ( February 27, 1926 – March 9, 2002 ) was a Cuban-American physicist. He died in Washington, D.C. while working for the United States Air Force in Miami, Florida, during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Bell's work investigated waves in radioactivity, studied radar, meteor showers, space weather, weather forecasting, black-box weather stations, ionosphere, communication satellites, jet aircraft, lightning, space debris, nuclear reactor water vapor absorption and photoelectric discharge, ultraviolet rays, and other topics in the sciences.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Bell's father, Ernest, was a barber from Caguas, Mexico. He moved to Fort Lauderdale in 1946 and later to Rio Rancho, Mexico, where he was a demonstrator of physics at Fort Lauderdale Central High School and City College.  
 Bell graduated from Union College in Brooklyn, New York in 1948 with a B.A. degree in physics. He then received his M.A. in physics from Hunter College in 1948. He then transferred to Princeton University, where he earned a Ph.D. in physics under Hans Bethe.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After receiving his Ph.D., Bell and a team of graduate students at Princeton began experimenting with radar. In 1948, Bell and his co-workers discovered what they thought were anomalous interference patterns with increasing intensity. When they placed a heavy magnetic compass barbell in front of a computer designed to measure radio-activity at their laboratory, it reported anomalous effects.Because the Bahamas had just been hit by three separate jet explosions, Bell figured that if the disruptions were cumulative, the probability of large explosions of either the ground or upper atmosphere was very high, and that once a larger event had occurred, the probability of the smaller one would be the same.Bell went on to perform a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon and determined that the local weather was, in fact, shaping the weather, although the precise mechanism for this is not known. During the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which eventually led to the use of the now discredited helicopter spraying theory in South Vietnam, he concluded that the main cause of the storm was probably high-velocity, high-altitude cumulus rainstorms.He worked for the Office of Scientific Research and Development during the 1950s and 1960s. From the late 1960s until his death, he helped to build up the Manhattan Project and is the author of `` S. T. McConnell, `` Radiation and Deterrence '', `` Rays, '' `` Radar, '' and `` Space Weather ''. He was a member of the American Geophysical Union's Executive Committee for the Bicentennial of the American Geophysical Union.  
 Bell's writings have been referenced in books and studies and he has been considered one of the most important figures in science in the last 20 years. After his death, `` Astronomer V '', published by the Earth Institute, reprinted several of Bell's research papers and was one of the preprints for his book `` The Space Weather of the World.

Gregory of Valencia ( Spanish : Gregorio de Valencia ) ( c. 1550 – April 25 , 1603 ) was a Spanish humanist and scholar who was a professor at the University of Ingolstadt .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Gregory of Valencia was born in Medina del Campo around 1549–50 .   
 He received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Salamanca , where he undertook the Jesuit novitiate in 1565 . In 1567 , he went on to study theology at Salamanca , where through his instructor , Mancio , he became interested in the theological renewal movement initiated by Francisco de Vitoria .   
 He studied theology at Valladolid ( 1568–1571 ) .   
 In 1571 , he was called by St. Francis Borgia , superior general of the Jesuit order , to teach philosophy in Rome . There he was ordained a priest .   
 He continued his studies at Salamanca ( 1572 ) .

His compositional output includes several orchestral works , chamber works , and works for solo piano . He also wrote 4 ballets and a considerable amount of music for radio programs . In 1937 his symphonic poem Légende won the Jean Lallemand Prize which led to the work 's premiere performance that year by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under conductor Wilfrid Pelletier . The work was repeated by the orchestra in concerts the following year under conductor Sir Ernest MacMillan .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Born in Hull , Quebec ( now Gatineau , Quebec ) , Gratton studied music theory and composition with Albertine Morin-Labrecque , Oscar O'Brien , and Alfred Whitehead . He was a piano student of Alphonse Martin and Alfred La Liberté . From La Liberté he gained a great appreciation for the works and aesthetics of Nikolai Medtner and Alexander Scriabin , two composers which influenced his own compositional style.During the 1920s , Gratton toured with Charles Marchand performing folk music that was harmonized by O'Brien . He notably performed in concerts with Marchand at the CPR Festivals between 1927-1930 . He soon after began working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during the early years of national radio . He composed and conducted music for Je me souviens , one of the first major Canadian radio series which featured scripts by Félix Leclerc . Also notable among his compositions for CBC Radio   
 was the incidental music for Cécile Chabot 's 1945 Christmas story L'Imagerie.Gratton died in Montreal in 1970 at the age of 69 . He was made an associate of the Canadian Music Centre posthumously .

 = Dorothea von Heytinger =  
Dorothea von Heytinger ( 1567–1645 ) was a Norwegian woman who wrote an abridged version of the Tale of Harald Hedin. She died while traveling, probably from plague, but her manuscript survives, and includes a full index to the Tale. The first printed version appeared in London in 1619.  
   
   
 == Background ==  
 Heytinger was the daughter of a wealthy tailor who owned several shops in Norway, and her mother was Stig Vidhelm Fyrstad, a carpenter in their home village of Kaarupøy.  
 Dorothea von Heytinger was the first of three children born to the tailor and his wife. When her father died in 1585, her mother continued her embroidery and made substantial improvements to her harp. She became the fourth of her three daughters, and travelled throughout Norway to attend school. She married Edward Junge Danberbruns around 1598. She worked as a school teacher until 1707, when she became a professor at the University of Østfold.  
   
   
 == Publication ==  
 The second edition of the Tale of Harald Hedin was published in Norway in 1619. The poem `` Norske Voyn to svenska Østfold '' was published in a pamphlet written by her sister, the feminist Nellmei Dettsker. It was accompanied by a booklet ( entitled `` Discorsi forma usu capitale Latin '' ), in which she described the procedure of surviving a plague. This pamphlet was subsequently published in the United States as the first volume of a large anthology by J. H. Hudson and C. L. Myers titled Voynas Ungdritt i hansen. This was eventually reprinted in two volumes, and continued to be popular after its founding in 1902, reprinted by the American Steamship Company in 1943. In the supplement to the first book, she appears to refer to `` the harp of my father, the smith of my mother's, and the sweeper of the house, '' referring to herself and her family, whom she describes as `` good linenners ''. However, there is no record of her having spoken of their profession. They are presumably described in the Tales of Harald Hedin, and the passage in the third book that gives her identity as a nun seems to have originated with Hedin's own narrative, which may have begun as a comment on the women's right to accessie against persecution by the Church.  
   
   
 == Literary legacy ==  
   
 Dorothea von Heytinger has been listed as the author of more than 35 editions of the Norwegian version of the Tale of Harald Hedin. Her uncle was Henrik Stanislaus von Heytinger. A merlot from Harald Hedin's collected travels has been called `` her jellied hazel, milk-beer, and chocolate ''.

 Born into a prominent Italian intellectual family, Pezzoli attended the prestigious lyceum of Buonaparte, from which he graduated in 1936. After a year at the state University of Lombardy, he joined the faculty at the Pontifical Gregorian University, in Rome, as lecturer in philosophy in 1939 and professor of pedagogy in 1948. In 1951, he joined the Pontifical Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ), as an associate director, as he was able to separate from the University and was soon appointed chairman of the CSIR itself, later becoming principal of the Pontifical Commission for Ecumenical Affairs.  
 When Pope Paul VI requested Pezzoli to rejoin the Catholic hierarchy in 1957, he asked that he retire as a priest so that he could focus on his scientific studies. Nevertheless, Pope John Paul II ( in a message to the Spanish-speaking world on October 14, 1958 ) bestowed upon Pezzoli the title Prefect of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and entrusted him with the task of establishing in Rome the Centre for International Scientific Cooperation.  
 In 1971, Pezzoli was made a candidate to succeed the late Pope Paul VI. After his death, Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed him Apostolic Nuncio and Bishop of Pavia, and installed him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Gregorio, the first Latin American to serve as such. In 1986, Pezzoli became a member of the Academie des Hautes Études Sociales. He died on July 29, 2005, in Bologna.

 = Frank Sharpley (geologist) =  
Frank Lawrence ( 1795-1841 ) was an American geologist, professor, anthropologist and mineralogist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Sharpley was born in Grimsby, Vermont. He was educated at Grinnell College, joining an international geological collection along the way. He was the only surviving student to complete a university degree there. He studied anthropology in Brazil from 1818 to 1824. He lectured at University College London from 1824 to 1827. In 1832 he returned to England where he served as a professor of the Ancient History of England. He was an advocate of the Loch Ness Monster until scientific investigations ceased to exist.  
   
   
 == Teaching career ==  
 Sharpley was appointed head of the department of geology of University College London in 1827. He remained at that position for nine years, becoming its third chief of geological science and its first permanent chairman in 1832. At this time he worked to eliminate the insubstantial errors and omissions that led to school and agricultural practices that had been `` predominantly handed down from previous societies ''.As head of the geological department of University College London, Sharpley was on the commission appointed in 1841 to examine the `` value of certain erroneous and corrupt geological records '' to establish that the Canary Islands were a colony of a Spanish coastal empire. Much of the important material relating to this claim would later be lost. Sharpley's comprehensive survey of the Canary Islands in 1844 confirmed the claim that they were a Dutch colony, particularly the colonizing of an extensive area. He also won the support of Jane Addams to the creation of a body of evidence that supported the claim of Dutch possession over the island.Sharpley retired in 1843, settling in the state of Delaware. He returned in 1849 to University College London, where he became professor emeritus in 1865. He lived in the working class community of Allston and died there in 1841.

Robert Fiske Griggs ( 22 August 1881 in Brooklyn , Connecticut – 10 June 1962 ) , was a botanist who led a 1915 National Geographic Society expedition to observe the aftermath of the Katmai volcanic eruption .   
 In June 1917 , Griggs and the eager NGS explorers rushed to the Katmai coast with the express goal of exploring the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes . They quickly worked their way up through the ash-filled Katmai River valley and over the pass . It was a month of terror and elation for the twelve adventurers . Through the long Alaska summer days , they took chemical and geologic samples , shot photographs , and made rough maps . Mincing their way across the crumbling , treacherous surface of the hot ash , they studied the temperatures and temperaments of the roaring fumaroles and explored the perilous margins of the pyroclastic deposits . As they explored and documented the valley , they began to build a picture of the eruption . For five years , the American public had been entranced by the exciting volcanic discoveries in Alaska . Hungry for stories to push the horrors of World War I from their minds , thousands of National Geographic subscribers were thrilled to read Griggs ’ gripping articles about the adventures of his exploring parties .   
 As the discoveries unfolded , Griggs became increasingly zealous in his advocacy of the site . His vivid descriptions of the wonders of the Katmai country ignited the interest of what was then a budding conservation movement in the United States . The mysterious volcanic valley seemed an ideal candidate for protection . Griggs and the chiefs of the National Geographic Society campaigned persistently to preserve the area , and in 1918 , President Woodrow Wilson declared 1,700 square miles ( 4,400 km2 ) of land as Katmai National Monument .   
 He holds degrees from Ohio State University ( BA ) , University of Minnesota ( MA ) , and Harvard University ( Ph.D ) and taught at Fargo College , Ohio State , George Washington University , and University of Pittsburgh .

Alexander V. Wrangham ( March 3, 1897 – March 18, 1980 ) was an American physician, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research on the effects of ultraviolet light on health.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Wrangham was born in Pottsville, New York, to a family of educators. His grandfather, James Wrangham, was a teacher of Russian and Russian literature, and his great-grandfather, Daniel Wrangham, was the seventh President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ). He received an MA from Mount Holyoke College and an MD from New York University School of Medicine in New York City. He married Colleen Burr on March 20, 1918. They had four daughters, including Claire Wrangham Wrangham and Alyn Wrangham Wrangham. He earned a Ph.D. in physiology from NYU in 1926, with a dissertation on the effects of ozone on the kidneys.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 In his research, Wrangham looked at the effects of ultraviolet ( U ) radiation on the kidneys. He then compared the rate of urination with that of air at different depths. The results showed that this radiation affected the entire urinary system more than other types of radiation. Wrangham further demonstrated that urination was inhibited at a rate much greater than the rate at which a chemical reaction took place.Wrangham's experiments also showed that urination was the most sensitive part of the urinary tract, and that only the kidneys responded to this radiation, which meant that urination would not slow down as the brain became accustomed to the high level of urination.Wrangham was recognized for his work at The Rockefeller Institute. He later became Professor at the University of California, San Diego. He was also Dean of the Biological Sciences department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was considered one of the greatest biologists of his time, and his laboratory is the subject of the biographical obituary `` Alexander Wrangham : Biographer '' of the Journal of Medical Photosynthesis.It was Wrangham's essay `` The Amity for Freedom '', published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which laid the foundation for later controversies over the limits of animal rights. The essay encouraged a belief in freedom of speech and personal autonomy. This led some to believe that Wrangham was a feminist, and the proponents of this interpretation disagreed with this, and that the results of the test he used were flawed. Wrangham himself said of this work, `` It seemed to me that man, like every animal, is influenced by this instinctive instinct to seek the cheapest share of a total producer of animal products ''.A documentary film about Wrangham, recently released, was produced by the Wrangham Institute for Health and Happiness, produced in collaboration with Univision. It was directed by Seth Schoenfeld, who served as medical editor for Dr. Wrangham's research.

Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant ( 23 August 1797 , Villiers-en-Bière , Seine-et-Marne – 6 January 1886 , Saint-Ouen , Loir-et-Cher ) was a mechanician and mathematician who contributed to early stress analysis and also developed the unsteady open channel flow shallow water equations , also known as the Saint-Venant equations that are a fundamental set of equations used in modern hydraulic engineering . The one-dimensional Saint-Venant equation is a commonly used simplification of the shallow water equations . Although his full surname was Barré de Saint-Venant in mathematical literature other than French he is known as Saint-Venant . His name is also associated with Saint-Venant 's principle of statically equivalent systems of load , Saint-Venant 's theorem and for Saint-Venant 's compatibility condition , the integrability conditions for a symmetric tensor field to be a strain .   
 In 1843 he published the correct derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations for a viscous flow and was the first to `` properly identify the coefficient of viscosity and its role as a multiplying factor for the velocity gradients in the flow '' . Even though he published before Stokes , the equations do not bear his name .   
 Barré de Saint-Venant developed a version of vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann ( now understood as exterior differential forms ) which he published in 1845 . A dispute arose between Saint-Venant and Grassmann over priority for this invention . Grassmann had published his results in 1844 , but Barré de Saint-Venant claimed he had developed the method in 1832 .   
 Barré de Saint-Venant was born at the château de Fortoiseau , Villiers-en-Bière , Seine-et-Marne , France .   
 His father was Jean Barré de Saint-Venant , ( 1737–1810 ) , a colonial officer of the Isle of Saint-Domingue ( later Haiti ) . His mother was Marie-Thérèse Josèphe Laborie ( born Saint-Domingue , 1769 ) . He entered the École Polytechnique , in 1813 at sixteen years old . where he studied under Gay-Lussac . Graduating in 1816 he worked for the next 27 years as an engineer , initially his passion for chemistry led him a post as a élève-commissaire ( student commissioner ) for the Service des Poudres et Salpêtres ( Powders and Saltpeter Service ) and then as a civil engineer at the Corps des Ponts et Chaussées . He married in 1837 , Rohaut Fleury from Paris . Following a disagreement on an issue of road with the Municipal Administration of Paris , he was suddenly retired as `` Chief Engineer , second class '' , on 1 April 1848 . In 1850 Saint-Venant won a contest to be appointed the chair of Agricultural Engineering at the Agronomic Institute of Versailles , a post he occupied two years.He went on to teach mathematics at the École des Ponts et Chaussées ( National school of Bridges and Roads ) where he succeeded Coriolis .   
 In 1868 , at 71 years old , he was elected to succeed Poncelet in the mechanics section of the Académie des Sciences , and continued research work for a further 18 years . He died in January 1886 at Saint-Ouen , Loir-et-Cher . Sources differ on his date of death : gives 6 January whereas 22 January . In 1869 he was given the title 'Count ' ( comte ) by Pope Pius IX .

 = Oskar de Groot =  
Oskar M C3 A8ld C3 B6gel de Groot ( 12 May 1888 – 9 May 1945 ) was a Dutch mathematician who contributed to differential equations, topology and algebraic topology.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 de Groot was born in Linseenam, Baden.  
 He was a member of `` Die Angewandte Handelslehre '' ( the Royal Institute of Technology, and from 1931 held the chair in algebraics ). He became a member of `` Theoretische Lehre von den Sud '' ( `` Theoretical Teaching School of the Royal Institute of Technology '' ) in 1908, and continued to hold that position until his death. He had four sons and one daughter.  
 In 1912 he published `` Symmetry und Numerical Analysis '', which paved the way for later authors, including Cornelis van Hyck and Max Merkle. He was a strong supporter of algebraic topology, both in his honor and of Boager. He was one of the founders of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1931, and its secretary until his death.  
 He received a Ph.D. in 1936, and his position at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences at the time of his death was in mathematics.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 De Groot's major work was the book he is best known for, `` Symmetry and Numerical Analysis. ( co-written with Gert-Jan Huszel ). '' In it, de Groot developed the principle of homotopy groups. According to the principle, if two homotopy groups are now labeled with the same number of elements, then they have a common exterior. Subtracting the number of elements in the group from the number of elements in the outer one produces the number of elements of the inner group ( or the number of primitives ). This number ( which is now called the homotopy group dimension ) is known as the homotopy product dimension and is written HGG ( roughly `` homotopy group product '' ).  
 He was also a pioneer in the field of integral geometry, which, according to quantum mechanics, also shows the existence of flat surfaces, for which they would be called n-adic.

Richard Crawshay ( 1739 – 27 June 1810 ) was a London iron merchant and then South Wales ironmaster .   
 Richard Crawshay was born in Normanton in the West Riding of Yorkshire . Initially starting work aged 16 , working for Mr Bicklewith of York Yard , Thames Street , London ( to whom he was apprenticed ) in a bar iron warehouse in London , he became sole proprietor of the business on Bicklewith 's retirement in 1763 .   
 He married Mary Bourne in 1763 and they had a son William and three daughters , Anne , Elizabeth and Charlotte . Charlotte married Benjamin Hall , and became the mother of Benjamin Hall , 1st Baron Llanover .   
 By the 1770s he was a leading London iron merchant , dealing mainly in Swedish and Russian iron . The firm was Crawshay and Moser in 1774 , but Crawshay , Cornwell and Moser in 1784 . The business still existed as R & W Crawshay in 1816 . By 1775 , he was acting as Anthony Bacon 's agent for supplying iron cannon to the Board of Ordnance and was from 1777 a partner in that business ( casting cannon at Cyfarthfa Ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil ) . This continued until Bacon had to give up government contracts in 1782 , because he was a member of Parliament .   
 In 1786 , following the death of Anthony Bacon , he took over the whole Cyfarthfa Ironworks , in partnership with William Stevens ( a London merchant ) and James Cockshutt , who had previously managed the forge and boring mill for David Tanner . In May 1787 he took out a licence from Henry Cort for his puddling process , but the rolling mill needed was not completed until 1789 . He solved the problems of the puddling process by using an iron plate for the furnace ceiling and sea-washed sand for the floor . In 1791 he terminated the partnership , which had made little profit . He continued the business alone , and had two blast furnaces , 8 puddling furnaces , 3 melting fineries , 3 balling furnaces , and a rolling mill in 1794 . A blast furnace was built by 1796 , and a fourth in 1796 . There were 6 by 1810 . He thus developed Cyfarthfa into one of the most important ironworks in South Wales .   
 Crawshay was very ambitious and imperious in manner , being called 'The Tyrant ' by some , but was without social pretension . He was active in protecting the interests of the iron trade and was a major promoter of the Glamorganshire Canal which immensely improved transport of iron to Cardiff Docks . At his death in 1810 his estate was worth £1.5 million . In his will he left three-eighths of his ironworks to his son William Crawshay I , three-eighths to his son-in-law , and two-eighths to his nephew Joseph Bailey .

His father worked as a steam elevator engineer and his mother as a superintendent. David graduated from high school in Rochester, New York in 1938. He completed college in 1957 with a B.S. in geology and anthropology at Columbia University.  
   
   
 == Early career ==  
 Foley served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan ( a post he held from 1945 to 1966 ), where he graduated with a degree in physical geography and geology in 1956. He joined the Geological Survey of Canada as an assistant chief of the section of dinosaur reptiles ( now known as troglobites ) in 1966.  
 In the 1980s, Foley left the Geological Survey to focus on coauthoring Fossil America, his magnum opus. The book remains one of his most popular works. A few years later, Foley published The Martian Hand, which focused on the evolution and physiology of the limbs in dinosaurs.  
   
   
 == Geological collaborators ==  
 David was a frequent collaborator of Walter Cadman and many other scientists. With Rudolf Bosmer, Foley worked on the economic paleobiology of the coelenterata of some dinosaurs. He also worked on gastropods, with later work in aquatic biostratigraphy.

 = William Howe (sister) =  
William Howe ( 22 March 1728 – 6 February 1839 ) was a British naturalist and naturalist journalist who wrote numerous articles and accounts of natural history for the Bostonian and other periodicals in the Bostonian journals.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born at Grewton, Somerset, the son of Thomas Howe, a farmer, and his wife Mary ( Sarah ) ( born Booth ). He had two younger sisters and two younger brothers, Isaac ( 1747–1805 ), of Dorchester, and John ( 1748–1822 ) of Surry, his uncle. His sister Sarah Howe died in childhood.  
 After leaving school, he worked in the ships at Tyne and Wear, going on to become a surgeon and later captain in the English shipyard and sea fortifications of Edinburgh. He left the firm in 1763 and worked for Sir Joseph Banks. He travelled and was master of horses and especially of horses which he purchased from the Gloucestershire Company. In 1767, he arrived in New York and worked for the Davises.  
 In 1772, he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, but two years later, with the financial difficulties resulting from war, his journey was delayed by drought, and he was forced to return to Europe by way of Japan. He stayed in Japan the next four years and made a collection of botanical plants and ferns from the local vineyards. He returned to London in 1780 and lived there until his death in 1839.He produced a major botanical collection during the Revolutionary War. He corresponded with John Ashby, two of the founders of the Royal Society, from 1776.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Howe became an important member of the scientific and literary community, and was appointed fellow of the Royal Society in 1764, later becoming the first Earl of Sandwich. When asked if he knew a certain story about William Borget and his son of Thomas, he replied that he had met them on the Cape and that they had come back from their excursion through many places through difficult country. Howe had to renounce the kingly title in 1780 because of various suspicious decisions by his brothers regarding the future of the family. Howe was elected an associate of the Royal Society in 1789, but never made an exhibition. The Royal Society described him as an `` obscure early correspondent '' but was strongly inclined to his inclination towards literature. He participated in the Goetheanum at Windsor. In 1797, Howe became an author and illustrator, having illustrated Jules Verne's Voyage of the Beagle and Pierre Bougon's Nausea, of which he produced many engravings and others representing old European country views. He was joint editor of the Memoirs of the Martyrs of Caithness. He wrote an account of his trip, in the anonymous Bostonian Magazine. He wrote letters of tribute to Jules Verne in Nature, the Dictionary of National Biography, the Memoirs of the Martyrs of Caithness and Historical Sketch of New England History in his own Notes on the River Mystic.  
   
 Howe died suddenly at his house in Surry, Suffolk, aged 49, on 6 February 1839, following a severe attack of fever. His death was reported at the time of his death ; other sources say he died on 7 February. Howe was survived by his second wife, Mary, who, unlike her brother, was not married to Verne.The biographical dictionary ( 1821 ) lists his surname as Howe.

 = Alexander Grose, 1st Baronet ( 7 December 1810 – 11 January 1895 ) was a Danish author, pedagogue, poet, and translator.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Alexander Grose was born in Bækant from a noble family, the grand-nephews of Tjern Habel ( who emigrated from Holland with his family to Denmark in 1644 ) and Cinna Dagnel ( 1642–1713 ), at Bækant Cathedral, and was educated in the home of his family at the old brothel which was later demolished to make way for a public bath. He was elected a Protestant minister at Bækant in 1839. He was elected a municipal councillor in 1852. From 1858 until 1858, he lived and worked in Denmark. He was awarded the Goethe Medal in 1862, a Prussian Knight of the Order of the White Eagle in 1867, the Franz Liszt Medal in 1872, and the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog ( 6th class ) in 1878. He became a professor of comparative mythology and began lecturing in 1798 and 1803 at the newly established University of Copenhagen.  
 Grose's translation of the works of Homer is considered an important advance. The translation of The Odyssey was completed in 1836, and his translation of the Aeschylus Epitome, begun in 1836, is regarded as one of the greatest of all translations. The publication of his History of Denmark was a decisive step forward in Danish history.  
 In 1785, Grose was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1814 the Danish Academy was founded in Copenhagen. The establishment of the Danish Academy was said to come about at Grose's suggestion. He also pioneered the introduction of the use of the French monogram of the University of Copenhagen.Grose served as minister and member of the Royal Danish Society, for three years ( 1821–23 ), and of the Academy of Sciences in 1835–1837, and as a member of the Danish Academy in 1863. Grose was elected the second king of Denmark in 1858.  
 Grose's poetry is the masterpiece of the best Danes, and his translations are used in modern Denmark and abroad.

George Barrow ( 11 December 1853 – 23 July 1932 ) was a British geologist.Barrow was born in St George Hanover Square , London , the fifth of eight children born to John George Barrow , a general practitioner at the Royal College of Surgeons , and his wife , Eleanor Barrow.Barrow matriculated at London University in 1871 , holding a Turner scholarship . Admitted to King 's College London , he studied science , winning prizes in mathematics and geology . He was the first to map a metamorphic gradient by determining a sequence of metamorphic zones in the metapelites of the Scottish Highlands . Every first appearance of an index mineral was taken by Barrow as the beginning of a new metamorphic zone . Later the underlying principles of metamorphic zones were clarified by the Finnish geologist Pentti Eskola , who introduced the concept of metamorphic facies . He was awarded the Bolitho Medal of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1912.He died in Chorleywood , Hertfordshire .

Fyodor Ivanovich Uspensky or Uspenskij ( Russian pronunciation : [ ˈfʲɵdər ɪˈvanəvʲɪtɕ ʊsʲˈpʲɛnskʲɪj ] ; Russian : Фёдор Иванович Успенский ) was the preeminent Russian Byzantinist in the first third of the 20th century . His works are considered to be among the finest illustrations of the flowering of Byzantine studies in the Russian Empire .   
 Uspensky was born near Galich in 1845 . He was educated at the University of St. Petersburg , with his first thesis ( 1872 ) dedicated to Nicetas Choniates . For two decades ( 1874-1894 ) he read lectures at the Novorossiysky University in Odessa . This position allowed him to spend considerable time abroad .   
 Uspensky 's doctoral thesis ( 1879 ) dealt with the foundation of the Second Bulgarian Empire . Although he specialized in the Byzantine-Bulgarian relations and investigated the Slavic influence on the Byzantine economy , Uspensky also researched and wrote extensively on the Crusades .   
 In 1894 Uspensky , who shared Slavophile ideals , decided to move to Constantinople to study and protect the surviving monuments of Byzantine antiquity , which had been neglected by the Ottoman authorities for centuries . He founded the Russian Archaeological Institute ( headquartered at Studion ) and presided over its pioneering archaeological research in Constantinople , Asia Minor , Macedonia and Bulgaria . In 1900 , he was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences . With the outbreak of World War I , Uspensky was forced to abandon his work and flee Turkey..   
 Back in Petrograd , the 70-year-old professor was invited to edit the organ of Byzantine studies , Vizantiyskiy Vremennik . After the October Revolution , he delivered lectures at the Leningrad University ( 1922–27 ) and , enduring criticism of the Bolshevik authorities , prepared for publication the results of a lifelong study , a monumental three-volume account of the history of the Byzantine Empire .   
 Uspensky died in Leningrad in 1928 . The posthumous publication of his magnum opus , based on numerous unpublished sources and unprecedented in scope , demonstrated the wide range of his scholarship . His book about the Trapezuntine Empire also appeared posthumously . The Taktikon Uspensky is named after him .

Elias David Rinehart ( 1856–1922 ) was a British dendrologist who pioneered genetic mapping of the morphology of mosses and lichens.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Rinehart was born in the Balliol family at 90 Everglades Road, Clifton, London, England. He was educated at Roehampton School and London School of Economics, gaining his BSc from University College London in 1895.In 1900, he was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.  
 In 1913, he became President of the Archaeological and Botanical Institute, holding that position until 1932, when he was succeeded by Sir Paul Anderson.His significant work was on mosses, lichens and mosses and calcareous algae. This included the mapping of the North-western edge of the Ashmolean Museum and of any association between British and German mosses. His suggestion that some of the rare Douglas fir forests of the Gleneagles were once forest was published posthumously by the botanist Charles Smith in 1924. A glossary of terms had already been prepared for the Glossary of Scots and Welsh Entomological Terms by Timothy Dawson Smith in 1885.  
 Rinehart specialized in the microscopic morphology of mosses and lichens, which he discovered at the Howard Stephenson Museum in Gloucestershire, and ( together with Otis Jones ) correlated plant species, characterising many previously undescribed species. His work on lichens, mosses and leaves became internationally known when, for the first time, published, as Flora of the Isles of Scilly ( 1922 ), a study of mosses from the Hakean and Eastern Hills ( Wales ).He died in 22 December 1922 at a cottage near Chiltern, Somerset, England, at the age of 77.

 = Johann Gottlob Carpzov =   
Johann Gottlob Carpzov ( 26 September 1679 , Dresden – 7 April 1767 , Lübeck ) was a German Christian Old Testament scholar , a nephew of Johann Benedict Carpzov II and a son of Samuel Benedict Carpzov . He was the most famous and most important Biblical scholar of the Carpzov family . He was titular professor of Oriental languages at Leipzig from 1719 to 1730 , and preacher and theologian until his death . Like his uncle , he was an opponent of the Pietists . His critical works are : Introductio in Libros Vet . Test . 1721 , 4th ed . 1757 ; Critica Sacra ( I . Original text , II . Versions , III . Reply to Whiston ) , 1728 ; Apparatus Historico-Criticus Antiquitatum et Codicis Sacri et Gentis Hebrææ , 1748 . The Apparatus is in the form of annotations to Thomas Goodwin 's Moses and Aaron , and appended to it are dissertations on `` The Synagogue Treated with Honor '' ( a statement of what the Christian Church has retained of ancient Jewish customs ) , on `` The Charity System of the Ancient Jews '' ( discussion of the question whether צדקה in the Old Testament ever means `` alms '' ) , and others .   
 According to the Jewish Encyclopedia ,   
    
 Carpzov represents both an advance and a retrogression in Biblical science — an advance in fullness of material and clearness of arrangement ( his Introductio is the first work that deserves the name ) , and a retrogression in critical analysis , for he held fast to the literal inspiration of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament and bitterly opposed the freer positions of Simon , Spinoza , and Clericus . His antiquarian writings are still interesting and useful .

Karl Zatz ( 20 January 1909 – 26 April 1983 ) was a German sociologist and one of the leading sociologists of the Third Reich. From 1948 to 1948 he headed the German Statistical Institute. From 1950 to 1952 he headed the Social Analysis Institute. From 1952 to 1955 he headed the Institute for the Study of Social Policy. From 1955 to 1958 he headed the Social Theory Research Institute ( German : Verwaltungs-Verwaltungsschutz-Institut ). He was also in 1947 a founding member of the German Statistical Institute, a vice president of the Institute for the Study of Social Policy and chairman of the Committee on Economic and Social Research.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Zatz was born in Erlangen. He was educated at the University of Erlangen and the Technische Hochschule ( Technology Institute ) of the University of Freiburg, where he later earned his doctorate in 1945. After graduation he worked for the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( Ministry of War Production ) and again at the Ministry of Finance. After the Second World War he was involved in anti-communist activities in his home city of Berlin and in the Great Depression.  
 Zatz's ideas made him particularly unpopular among political conservatives, particularly those opposed to Ludwig von Mises'position that science should be carried on with empirical methods and objective decision making. Social scientists were against the mainstream `` theory '' of the German state, since the German ideal of man was the individual. Zatz's work sparked the radicalization of Germany's political scientists. His theory of experimental sociology was the first to argue for the application of multiple focus to problems of organization. His research focused on industrial research, industrial social capital, and the American Institute of Industrial Research, whose members included the economist Reinhold Niebuhr. Zatz drew the leading Marxist economists ’ attention to the importance of the relations between capitalist and proletariat in the economy.  
 He developed widely used statistics for agricultural production and the working class of Germany. He then developed theoretical models of social conflict and decided how they would be justified. These theories, backed by empirical data from Nazi Germany and the 1960s experiments of the U.S., had significant impact on the ideas of political science and the study of social science.  
 Zatz died in Berlin in 1983.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Zatz married Elisabeth Ritschl between 1923 and 1929. They had two sons, Karl and Ernst, and a daughter, Helene, who was an expert with nuclear power and social engineering.

 = Hal Buberman =  
Hal Buberman ( Hebrew : נסיקות גון גלולה‎, August 10, 1912 – October 22, 1986 ) was a prominent biblical scholar and historian of the Hebrew Bible.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Hal Buberman was born in Rishon LeZion, the son of Yeraim Buberman and Rofhel Bernstein. He went to secondary school in Petah Tikva. His father opened the grocery store in Edelstein, and a family of ten was living there in the summer of 1934, and a second store opened in 1934. By the age of ten, he had developed his interests in philosophy, Oriental languages, and art and his religious training. In 1935, he entered Talbots College, and he also studied Hebrew. A year later, he was appointed as a study assistant to Prof. Emile Migne at the Hebrew University. However, he was later awarded a scholarship by the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and at the beginning of 1938 was granted his Ph.D. He taught at Columbia University, University of Illinois, and the University of Paris ( from 1942–45 ).  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 During World War II, Buberman was stationed at the Hospital of St. Joseph in Jerusalem as an emergency medical doctor, during the course of which he learned about the use of plasma therapy in treating patients with open wounds, and had the opportunity to observe, in detail, several animal experiments on its use. In 1944, while serving as a director of the city of Jerusalem's hospital, he was called to investigate the use of hypernatremia in the treatment of some infectious diseases. This led him to work on modern studies in the origins and history of blood plasma in the ancient world. Buberman undertook research in different fields as well : he was the co-author of several biblical studies on the life of Jesus, the biblical Geonim and a study on the Book of Isaiah which was published in 1947.  
 Buberman authored many volumes of historical studies in the history of Israel. In 1952, he wrote, A History of the Genesis of Israel, that traces the development of the religion, Jewish sources, Old Testament texts and their translations, from early Aramaic to Hebrew. He provided a historical overview of the Jewish religious system, pointing out that early times were characterised by fixed beliefs, practices and antiquities. At the same time, he concluded that Hebrew history had in fact become increasingly diverse, and that some early religious figures, influenced by the Canaanite prophets, had passed into later history, becoming increasingly independent.

 In 1956, Buberman, at age 65, suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for several months in Bnei Shimon, Braskonia, where he died in 1986.

He worked at the Institute of Zoology at Harvard ( 1892–95 ), before founding the Labçier du Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in 1905, where he led pioneering studies of the wild Atlantic red spot. His doctoral work, `` Description des species électrophoriques dans l'Isle Royale '' ( 1896 ) was based on observations of African red spot species. He served as a commissioner in the French presidency from 1902–1906, and served on several committees, such as the Association Française des Sciences Politiques, and the League de Suppléments Sociales de l'Académie de Musique in the same position ( 1907–10 ). He was also an emeritus professor, retiring in 1944.In his earlier years, he made extensive use of arachnids to study dark fungi, notably the Red-throated Entoloma moth, the only freshwater organism known to create cycads. Other significant studies involved the Qosiinella monachum and the commonly sighted Pleurovorella dolichopus. Maîtresse also gave students time to study the natural history of magma. Among his major collaborators was Eduard von Maisel.

He was responsible for the design of a number of cryptographic protocols in the 1980s, including the Stuxnet worm and its remnants. He is best known as the creator of System 0, an algorithm for calculating the logarithm of pi and its successors.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Norton was born to a New York Jewish family in New York City. He was the only child of Edward Norton ( 1891–1968 ), a banking executive and one-time president of the New York City Department of Finance, and Ann Norton ( 1908–1993 ), a medical researcher. He grew up in Queens. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York.

 In 1953 Norton founded the Baker-Norton Corporation, which he sold in 1976. This subsequently sold to the NASA Astronautics Research Laboratory. His former employer was the European Foundation, whose chairman was Heinz Brandt, founder of Heinz-Brandt Aircraft Corporation.  
 His work focused on systems and techniques of protecting critical data by `` distributed computing '', originally in collaboration with Phil Zimmermann. He also developed an alternative method for decrypting the symmetric ciphertext by mixing independent germane bits. He is particularly known for his work with Milton Nash, contributing to the construction of a pseudorandom hash function for AES that allows for a stronger and more reliable system-wide cryptanalysis.  
 He taught at Cornell University, the University of Chicago, and then briefly at Johns Hopkins University before leaving in the mid-1990s. He worked as an advisory fellow for the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from 1992 to 2001, before his departure to work on the Wireshark team at DeepMind, an Internet security company. He did his post at DeepMind at NASA until 2004. Norton wrote for a number of journals, including British Computer Society, Cybernetica, Computer and Communication Society, and Digital Bulletin.

 Youssef Wahba was born in Cairo , Egypt in 1852 of a prominent Coptic family . His father , Wahba Bey had been a founder of the first Coptic charitable society that included Muslim scholars such as Abdallah Nadim and Sheikh Muhammed Abduh . He translated the Code Napoleon into Arabic while at the Ministry of Justice between 1875 and 1882 and participated in setting the modern judicial system in Egypt becoming one of the first Egyptian judges in the Mixed Court of Appeals in 1894.He later became Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1912 then Minister of Finance from 15 April 1914 until 21 May 1920 . As Minister of Finance , he introduced the first bank notes in Egypt backed by the full faith and credit of the Egyptian Sultanate which bore his signature as Minister of Finance . He became Prime Minister of Egypt in 1919 during a difficult period in Egypt 's political life . Many members of the Coptic Christian community to which he belonged , objected to his accepting the premiership on the grounds that it would antagonize the relationship between Muslims and Christians when both were united under the Wafd Party to fight against the British occupation . Youssef always maintained the view that it was critical that a government nominated by the Sultan of Egypt lead the country rather than have the British fully annex it ( especially as the victorious powers were carving up the old Ottoman Empire at the Versailles conference ) . During his premiership , Youssef Wahba introduced several economic reforms including the removal of price controls on agricultural products , probably a first in the history of Egypt , as well as the creation of the Banque Misr by Talaat Harb Pasha , the first national bank .   
 He joined the first independent Senate when he was elected from a district in Alexandria in 1924 . During his tenure in the Egyptian Senate , he supported various legislation relating to strengthening the independence of the Egyptian judicial system . He also resisted the introduction of any special privileges for minorities in Egypt whether based on ethnicity or religion ( including the Christian Copts ) first suggested by the Brunyate Commission for Judicial reform in 1917 . He retired from the Senate in 1930.He has two publications on the Commercial Code in Egypt , the first co-authored with Shafik Mansour Bey `` Sharh Al Qanun Al Madani '' ( An Analysis of the Egyptian Civil Code ) and the second , co-authored with a fellow Judge from the Mixed Court Abdel Aziz Kahil Bey `` Sharh Al Qanun Al Toujari Al Masri ( An Analysis of The Egyptican Commercial Code ) . Youssef Wahba also drafted the constitution of the Majllis Milli , the first Coptic Christian council to manage the affairs of the Coptic community in Egypt in 1882 outside of the control of the Coptic Orthodox Church .   
 He died in 1934 and was married to Doudou , daughter of Mikhail Bey El Nakkadi and had eight children . Two of his sons Mourad Wahba Pasha ( 1879-1972 ) and Sadek Wahba Pasha ( 1885-1971 ) had prominent careers in the Egyptian judicial system and the diplomatic service respectively . Youssef Wahba 's grandson , Sadek Wahba , is a notable New York City-based managing partner of a private equity firm I Squared Capital and member of the board of trustees of the American University in Cairo .

 He is notable for having determined the solar constant at Mont Blanc in 1875 , and , in 1881 , for proposing a standard for luminous intensity , called the Violle , equal to the light emitted by 1 cm² of platinum at its melting point . ( It was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp , but it was made obsolete by the candela , the standard SI unit . )   
 Throughout his life , Violle taught at several colleges including the University of Lyon and the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris . He was one of the founders of the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée and the École supérieure d'optique . He improved and invented a number of devices for measuring radiation , and determined the freezing and melting points of palladium .   
 Violle is believed by some to be the secret identity of Fulcanelli , a contemporary French alchemist whose true identity is still debated . His biography can be found in this book : `` A l'ombre des chênes , l'alchimiste de la République '' . [ 1 ]

 = Charles Dubois (treasurer) =   
Charles Dubois or Charles du Bois ( 10 September 1658 ( baptised ) -20 October 1740 ) , was treasurer to the East India Company and a botanist . He corresponded with other naturalists including James Petiver , William Sherrard and Hans Sloane and was famous for maintaining a garden with interesting plants from the colonies . He was instrumental in introducing rice cultivation in North America .   
 Dubois was the son of John Dubois ( 1622-1684 ) and Anne , daughter of Charles Herle . The wealthy Huguenot family was in the cloth and silk trade and Charles inherited his father 's home at Mitcham , Surrey , where he had a garden filled with the newest exotics at that time in course of introduction . John Dubois was involved in the politics of London and represented the Whigs . In 1681 he was in the Committee of the East India Company . A son who was also known as John Dubois became cashier general to the East India Company on 30 September 1697 . Dubois became cashier-general to the East India Company on 27 October 1702 after the death of his step-brother , John Dubois the younger . In 1730 Charles Dubois and his nephew Waldo Dubois were implicated in a financial scandal involving some cargo shipments and false accounts . In 1734 he and a clerk named Tullidge were implicated in monetary losses arising from accepting security notes instead of cash from traders . As regards botany , he seems to have been chiefly a patron rather than a worker ; thus he appears as one of twelve English subscribers to Micheli 's ‘ Nova Genera , ’ 1728 . His name , however , occurs as having contributed observations to the third edition of Ray 's ‘ Synopsis , ’ 1724 . Many of the plants in his collection was acquired by his step-brother Daniel du Bois while others came from correspondents such as Edward Bulkley in Madras . His dried plants occupy seventy-four folio volumes , the entire number of specimens being about thirteen thousand , and are in excellent preservation ; they form part of the herbarium at the Oxford Botanic Garden . Dubois also collected shells , fossils and coins . He made notes on insects as well . Dubois obtained rice seed from India which was introduced into British South Carolina in 1766 through a Thomas Marsh.He died 21 October 1740 . It has been claimed Brown established his genus Duboisia in honour of Charles Dubois but it was actually named in honour of a Louis Dubois .

 = Kenneth Harvey Nash =  
Kenneth Harvey Nash ( April 27, 1913 – May 18, 2001 ) was an American author and professor of physiology at Columbia University.Nash published in over 100 scientific and popular science journals.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Nash was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Willis F. and Irene Beatrice Nash. He earned a B.S. degree in physiology from the University of Connecticut in 1935, followed by a Ph.D. in physiology from MIT in 1937. His doctoral thesis was on the ATPase activity of kidney glycogen and work during the early stages of diuretic therapy. After graduate studies at Cambridge and University of Berlin, he received his D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1939.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At Columbia, he was head of the Department of Physiology from 1939 to 1946. After he received his doctorate, Nash published nearly 100 scientific articles, including three books. He is recognized as the inventor of the alkaline vitamin G and the phytochemical ring carbon-10-ethyl-3-benzoin, credited with inventing the nitrous oxide, also known as `` cat's cradle ''. While he was on the faculty at Columbia, he founded the International Institute of Molecular Biophysics, an organization for the study of molecular biophysics. He is a recipient of the John F. Kennedy Biomedical Research Center Medal in 1997.After leaving Columbia, he taught at the Federal Bureau of Chemistry from 1952 to 1955. During this time he published several reports on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their role in lipid metabolism. These reports were the inspiration for a proposed paper written by Nash in 1957.  
 In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Nash was chief scientist for several chemical companies. His research interests included the oxidative phosphorylation of phosphatidylcholine and the metabolism of dietary proteins. Nash also published extensively on aliphatic phosphorus in vascular smooth muscle, the biochemistry of in vitro studies of salivary lipase, vitamin K metabolism and synthesis of vitamin E.In addition to his academic work, Nash was a medical doctor for over 30 years, serving on the New York State Medical Council and the New York State Nursing Commission. Nash was also Chairman of the Epidemiology and Public Health Division of the New York State Medical Society.Nash died in New York City, aged 82.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Nash published extensively on the biochemical and physiologic effects of aliphatic phosphorylating, the enzymes needed for the proton pump reaction that causes sodium chloride to ionize to magnesium chloride. The triazole oxygen oxygen ring catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ). Several sulfur, amino-acid and carbonyl rings are used to accept the free radicals. A variety of enzymes can be converted to the green radicals nitric oxide and nitric acid ; however, nitric oxide is only formed by fission of a blue radical. The breakdown of organochlorine gases is controlled by the organochlorine redox system, which is constantly being changed. At the molecular level, oxidative phosphorylation of DNA leads to synthesis of vitamin A, which then binds to ribonuclease.

 Jonas was born in Breslau in 1851. In 1882 he graduated from the University of Breslau with a doctorate in Botany. During his doctoral studies he learned oriental languages, and also worked in the medical faculty at the University of Basel, where he spent much of his academic career. In 1884–1887 he was a professor of natural history at the Humboldt University of Berlin and later became Professor of Natural History in 1891.  
 Jonas was a passionate citizen of the Heiligenhauptemberg region. He was especially interested in the study of the flora of South-East Asia, especially of the highland areas of Nepal and Tibet, and co-authored numerous scientific papers with Alois Fischer. He was also interested in the administration and promotion of botany in rural areas of Germany. During the civil war period of 1870–1871 he was mayor of Graz.  
 Jonas was an early supporter of Franz Friedrich von Pfitzner and Georg Wilhelm Schmid. In 1878 he published his work Zur Herbivorae Botanicus, in which he showed the striking parallel between plants of China and of India. In 1890, Jonas became one of the first scientists to show that crops can grow in humid habitats, and on this occasion he also suggested several reforestation schemes.  
 In 1894 he authored `` Das Herbivorne des Edeles '' ( with Leo Fredelfeld ).In 1902, Jonas was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Ostfront, and in 1908, he was awarded the title of Fürst der Bürger München ( for outstanding service ).

 Muench was born to a noble family. He studied medicine at the Universities of Leipzig and Königsberg and graduated in 1816. In 1822 he became a physician at Stuttgart, first under physician M. Rauern, and then under anatomical surgeon P. Schüler, to whom he became particularly close after his examinations in 1824 and 1826, respectively, at the University of Heidelberg and Halle. In 1828 he succeeded Schüler as the anatomist to the federal court in Koblenz.In 1833, he was appointed lecturer at the University of Braunschweig.  
   
   
 == Botanical collections ==  
 Muench published on a range of topics, many of which are held in the University Library's National Botanical collection. A specific field of study, however, is marine biology. He made meticulous note of a number of marine species found only on that branch of the ocean, describing each species in considerable detail, ranging from crustaceans to whales. He was particularly influenced by the descriptions by British physician Edward Huxley, followed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and the work of British botanist James de Gray ( 1793–1869 ).

 == Views on atomic energy ==  
 Leuthold opposed nuclear energy as a means of solving the energy problem.At the 1914 Paris Conference on Atomic Energy, Leuthold presented the viewpoint that the concepts of `` radioactive '' and `` radioactive energy '' were merely synonyms for the same concept. He also argued that the use of energy became a `` necessary evil '' in the sense that it might destroy the chances of perfect investigation of the fundamental nature of the atomic structure of the nucleus. The issue was explored at length at the 1915 Mannheim Conference.

John Steele Gates ( October 14, 1919 – October 10, 1999 ) was an American liberal and activist organizer. He is best known for his efforts to unionize the United Auto Workers.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Gates was born on October 14, 1919 in Dundee, Indiana, the son of Walton Gates, a caretaker for sick and elderly people, and Marion Hemsley, née Payne. His father died before John was born, leaving the family in the poor state of Indiana. John attended the University of Chicago and then entered the University of Missouri, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1927. After an unsuccessful attempt to register as a Democrat in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, Gates decided to seek a new career in economics as a public school education administrator in the Great Northern Railroad Company. While in Missouri, Gates also joined the class of 1940.  
 After moving to Flint, Michigan in 1937, Gates worked as a school board member and as a consultant for the Northern Pacific Railroads. In the late 1930s, Gates founded Michigan Organization for Democratic Action, a nationwide progressive organization that advocated on behalf of unionized employees in the public sector. He also served as the committee chairman for the Michigan Strike Debt Action Fund during the Mississippi Gulf War of the early 1950s. He resigned in 1951 as a West Coast committeeman to become an organizer for Democracy Works.  
 In 1956, Gates joined the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and then was a contributor and the first editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal until 1966. In the summer of 1968, Gates headed the Coalition to Organize Unemployment at the Lawrence Community College in Lawrence, Missouri, which encouraged a national assembly for unemployment benefits.  
 During his time as a journalist, Gates became an advocate of left-wing democratic socialism, and he spoke at conferences of social movements such as the August 7, 1968, May Day, and Solidarity Labor Day protests. In 1975, Gates was a founder of the Federation of Public Workers.  
 Gates died on October 10, 1999. He was survived by his wife Marian ( Doris ), two daughters, Marian Ford Gates and Betsy J. Gates, and a son.Gates'racial politics are remembered for his advocacy of black liberation in the late 1960s and 1970s.

 = Richard M. Scammon =   
Richard Montgomery Scammon ( July 17 , 1915 – April 27 , 2001 ) was an American author , political scientist and elections scholar . He served as Director of the U.S. Bureau of the Census from 1961 to 1965 . Afterwards , he worked for decades directing election analysis for NBC News .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Scammon was born in Minneapolis , Minnesota , and earned a bachelor 's degree in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1935 . He later earned a master 's degree from the University of Michigan , also in political science.Scammon enlisted in the Army during World War II , attaining the rank of captain . He served in occupied Germany after the war , rising to head the military government 's office of elections and political parties . After his discharge , he served as chief of the research division in Western Europe for the U.S. Department of State from 1948 to 1955.After leaving government service , Scammon founded the Elections Research Center in 1955 . Its enduring contribution was the long-running series of volumes , America Votes , which for the first time provided standard and reliable statistics for the results of major elections in all 50 states . ( The biennial compilations , published by Congressional Quarterly 's imprint , CQ Books , were later co-produced with Scammon associate Alice McGillivray . After Scammon closed the Center in 1995 , Rhodes Cook has continued to oversee production of America Votes . Scammon also served as a consultant to NBC News in the 1960 general election , working with the RCA computers and methods to call state-by-state totals for the Presidential race . He was briefly introduced to the audience on the air on election night .   
 In 1961 , President John F. Kennedy appointed Scammon as Census Director , which he continued until 1965 , during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson . Indeed , on November 13 , 1963 , Scammon was at the table for the 1st Planning Meeting of JFK 's 1964 Campaign To Re-elect The President ; a campaign which never occurred . According to the Washington Post , while serving as Director of the Census , Scammon was `` a personal adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on public opinion and political trends . `` Returning to his voting research , Scammon was hired by NBC News to direct its extensive election-night coverage in November 1968 . He continued his work as a consultant for NBC until 1988 . In 1976 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.As an author , Scammon 's most famous work was The Real Majority : An Extraordinary Examination of the American Electorate ( 1970 ) , co-authored with Ben J. Wattenberg . The New York Times described it as `` arguing that , for the Democratic Party to survive , it needed to look beyond the economic issues that dominated the American electoral scene in the first half of the 20th century , [ and ] toward social issues that deeply disturbed voters in middle America . '' In Scammon 's words , the typical voter was `` unyoung , unpoor and unblack . '' His blunt phrasing `` shocked many Democrats , but resonated true with others . `` In some ways , The Real Majority served as an answer to Kevin Phillips 's 1969 volume , The Emerging Republican Majority . And it presaged a shift away from the politics of the New Deal , and towards a more ideological politics , especially at the presidential level , that largely benefited Republicans in 1972 , 1980 , 1984 and 1988.Scammon was married to Mary Allen Scammon and lived in Chevy Chase , Maryland for five decades . He died of Alzheimer 's disease at a rest home in Gaithersburg .

 =  C3 89mile Blanchard =   
Charles Émile Blanchard ( 6 March 1819 – 11 February 1900 ) was a French zoologist and entomologist .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Blanchard was born in Paris . His father was an artist and naturalist and Émile began natural history very early in life . When he was 14 years old , Jean Victoire Audouin ( 1797—1841 ) , allowed him access to the laboratory of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle . In 1838 , he became a technician or préparateur in this then , as now , famous institution . In 1841 , he became assistant-naturalist .   
 He accompanied Henri Milne-Edwards ( 1800—1885 ) and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Breau ( 1810—1892 ) to Sicily on a marine zoology expedition . He published , in 1845 a Histoire des insectes , or History of the insects and , in 1854—1856 Zoologie agricole or Agricultural Zoology . This last work is remarkable : it presents in a precise way the harmful or pest species and the damage they cause to various crop plants . This work was illustrated by his father . Blanchard was critical of Darwinism . He argued that Charles Darwin 's pigeon studies were unscientific and that his ideas about evolution were false and unoriginal.In 1870 , Blanchard and Charles-Philippe Robin opposed the election of Darwin as a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences.He published an atlas of the anatomy of the vertebrates which appeared between 1852 and 1864 . This publication raised his hopes to obtain the chair of reptiles and fish at the Natural History Museum left vacant by the death of Auguste Duméril ( 1812—1870 ) but it was finally Léon Vaillant ( 1834—1914 ) who was selected . However , in 1862 , he was given the chair of natural history of Crustacea , Arachnida and Insects . He left this in 1894 following his infirmity . He was elected , in 1862 into the Academy of Science . He began to lose his sight after 1860 and became blind in 1890 . He died in Paris .

Dorothy Emma Smith ( née Thaler ) ( 22 July 1864 – 14 January 1949 ) was an American author and social activist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Smith was born in Petersburg, Georgia, the daughter of Samuel and Emily ( Martin ) Thaler. She attended the private Davidson-Roosevelt School, and graduated from and then obtained her PhD from Cornell University in 1883. She was an editor of American Free Press and the editor of the African-American magazine Unitarian Woman. She founded a Free Press classroom in Schenectady, New York.  
 As a senior at Yale University, she studied the works of Leon F. Burnside, and in particular Frederic Brown, and published her first book, Freedom and Responsibility, in 1897, in the series Civil and Political in America. She was also a leading supporter of feminist causes and influenced the way in which women were represented in poetry, fiction, and other creative fields. She became the first woman to lecture at Columbia University in 1899, and became the first female professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota, in 1901, in a joint program with Dorothy Savage.  
 In 1911 she co-founded the Gloria Steinem Club, an organization devoted to religious freedom and women's rights. Her work and organization inspired President Theodore Roosevelt and one of her early students, Alice Walker, to run for Congress as the New Party in 1912, and led to the establishment of the Woman Suffrage Caucus of 1916.  
 In 1903 Smith married Lowell Henry, with whom she had a son named Victor Smith.

 = Jacob Wolfowitz =   
Jacob Wolfowitz ( March 19 , 1910 – July 16 , 1981 ) was a Polish-born American statistician and Shannon Award-winning information theorist . He was the father of former United States Deputy Secretary of Defense and World Bank Group President Paul Wolfowitz .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Wolfowitz was born in 1910 in Warsaw , Poland , the son of Helen ( Pearlman ) and Samuel Wolfowitz . He emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1920 . In the mid-1930s , Wolfowitz began his career as high school mathematics teacher and continued teaching until 1942 when he received his Ph.D. degree in mathematics from New York University . While a part-time graduate student , Wolfowitz met Abraham Wald , with whom he collaborated in numerous joint papers in the field of mathematical statistics . This collaboration continued until Wald 's death in an airplane crash in 1950 . In 1951 , Wolfowitz became a professor of mathematics at Cornell University , where he stayed until 1970 . From 1970 to 1978 he was at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign . He died of a heart attack in Tampa , Florida , where he had become a professor at the University of South Florida after retiring from Illinois .   
 Wolfowitz 's main contributions were in the fields of statistical decision theory , non-parametric statistics , sequential analysis , and information theory .   
 One of his results is the strong converse to Claude Shannon 's coding theorem . While Shannon could prove only that the block error probability can not become arbitrarily small if the transmission rate is above the channel capacity , Wolfowitz proved that the block error rate actually converges to one . As a consequence , Shannon 's original result is today termed `` the weak theorem '' ( sometimes also Shannon 's `` conjecture '' by some authors ) .

 == Research ==   
 Edwards published more than one hundred journal articles and books including Decision Analysis and Behavioral Research and Utility Theories : Measurement and Applications . In the introduction to a Festschrift for Edwards , Barbara Mellers states [ 1 ]   
    
 Decision Science and Technology is a compilation of chapters written in honor of a remarkable man , Ward Edwards . Among Ward 's many contributions are two significant accomplishments , either of which would have been enough for a very distinguished career . First , Ward is the founder of behavioral decision theory . This interdisciplinary discipline addresses the question of how people actually confront decisions , as opposed to the question of how they should make decisions . Second , Ward laid the groundwork for sound normative systems by noticing which tasks humans can do well and which tasks computers should perform.In 1962 , Edwards founded the Bayesian Research Conference with the aim to incorporate and apply Bayesian statistical methods and ideas to decision theory . In Statistics he is well-known as lead author of Edwards , Lindman , and Savage ( 1963 ) , Bayesian Statistical Inference for Psychological Research , Psychological Review , 70 ( 3 ) , 193-242 . This article introduced the notion of 'stable estimation ' , and was the first to note that a p-value of 0.05 in the Normal model corresponded to a lower bound on the Bayes Factor of 0.26 .

 = Ernst Didand =  
Ernst Didand ( August 13, 1849 – May 4, 1915 ) was a Swiss American naturalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
 Didand was born on August 13, 1849 in Rue Pierre-Simon in the canton of Sanche-Périau ( Dansonstadt ). He was the second of four children, two of whom died in infancy.On September 11, 1885 his mother, Sophie Didand, died at her parents residence near Rheims. Ernst received an early education, receiving four lessons a day with the violin, piano and vocal exercises. In 1886 his family moved to Wismar, Sichuan, where he was enrolled at the École polytechnique in Paris. At the age of 20 he became a student at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Sciences Politiques in Paris.  
 In 1891, after the death of the inventor Jean Baptiste Basignon, Didand married the sister-in-law of the celebrated scientist Pierre Joseph Lidell, César François Lidell. César had come to Paris in 1890 from his native Lyons to study botany at the École polytechnique. He was a student of Le Père Jouan and the family later came from Burgundy to become the owners of the exporter Perrier.In 1895 Didand received an interest in nature from his mother. He took his first walks with Paul Jansen and was encouraged by Jacques Leclerc to become a botanist. Although he did not have any formal scientific training he could claim to have made extensive field observations. On May 10, 1898 he became an assistant to Jansen in the Zoological Station at Paris, where he prepared and attended the Botanical Congress at Vienna the following year. Here, and in the laboratory of Joseph August Heinrich Petermann, he gathered samples of blueberries, pawpaw, tomato, chamomile, liverwort, ginseng, ostracod fruit, etc.  
 In 1901 he applied for a position at the Botanical Museum in Königsberg, where he spent most of his career. His first appointment was a few months after the deaths of two of his brothers and another of his sisters in 1902 ; he worked in the laboratory of Jansen and subsequently, earning his living as a naturalist. In 1909 he also joined the staff of the newly formed Division of Plant Herbaria, and in 1913 became the first employee of the division's botanical collection.  
 He died in Königsberg, Switzerland, on May 4, 1915.  
 Didand had a complete work on the genus Aetolus collected from the numerous species of purple annelid, an African native, as well as from specimens of many other plant families. He published, with Jansen, the results of his explorations in 1920. However, much of his knowledge on plant anatomy was theoretical in nature, and appeared later without any testability for published in academic journals.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 As an original research assistant of Jansen, Didand was awarded the French Award of the Society for Experimental Botany in 1919.  
 The genus Didandia is named in his honor.

He worked at the Estonian National Centre for Scientific Research ( NCSIR ) and was the first director of the RIKEN ZSMIR ( Estonian Bio-Electron Microscope ) located in Nätsavärta University. He specialized in studies of phytoplankton, but also studied how seeds of plants are degraded by the sun and how to maximize their nutritional value, both of which have been central in his theories of plant nutrition.  
 Polydox received his bachelor's degree from the University of Uppsala ( 1964 ), and then his doctorate from the State University of Tallinn ( 1974 ). He then took a post as head of the University of Uppsala ’ s Institute of Plant Breeding ( IBI ) before becoming a professor.  
 Polydox did significant work to improve knowledge of terrestrial plankton and agriculture. He worked in this field for ten years at IBI and was elected director of the institute in 1996.Polydox was Professor of Environmental Engineering at NCSIR, and worked on the development of life support devices, ecology, developmental biology, `` living biology '' and invertebrate reproduction. He led the EAZ Biotechnology Research Centre, and worked on enzymatic regulation, gene expression and growth, and responded to marine contamination issues. He chaired the EAZ Bioengineering Association and the Biofuels Science Centre. His passion was astrophysics, and he was elected as a member of the International Academy of Astronautics in 1991.

 == Life ==   
 The Bodelschwingh family belonged to a Westfalian nobility . Friedrich 's father Ernst von Bodelschwingh was Prussia 's Finance Minister . His family 's links with the Hohenzollern made Friedrich von Bodelschwingh an early playmate of future emperor Friedrich III .   
 Friedrich von Bodelschwingh first wanted to study mining but eventually followed higher education in agriculture and became farm supervisor of a modern estate in Gramenz , in Eastern Pomerania , where he discovered the miserable situation of the landless farm workers .   
 Wanting to help the needy , he sought to engage in missionary activity but his parents convinced him to get a Protestant theology MA first . He studied in Basel , Erlangen and Berlin , and became a clergyman in 1863 .   
 His first parish was the German church in Paris . There were at the time in Paris about 80,000 German day labourers . Bodelschwingh raised money in Germany to build a church and a school near Buttes-Chaumont at 93 rue de Crimée , Paris 19e . From 1924 , the building became an orthodox church .   
 In 1872 , he became the head of a Protestant charity ( which had been established in 1867 in Bielefeld ) to take care of epileptic patients . Under his leadership , this institution became one of the most important ones among the German `` inner Mission '' , extending their activity to all forms of handicap .   
 In 1885 , in order to help the poor to become the owners of their house , he founded the first savings bank dedicated to the financing of housing in Germany .   
 In the 1890s he founded in Norddorf , on the island of Amrum , in the North Sea , a series of homes , destined to offer holidays in a Christian environment .   
 At the same time he pursued a political career as a royalist MP .   
 He died on 2 April 1910 and his son Friedrich von Bodelschwingh ( nicknamed pastor Fritz ) took over the management of the institutions by then identified by the name of Bodelschwingh ( Bodelschwinghanstalten ) .   
    
    
 == Influence ==   
 Friedrich von Bodelschwingh senior invented and applied several unusual and innovative ideas which have captured donors ' imagination and provided work to the poorer . For instance , he launched a collection of used clothes which is still on today ( die Brockensammlung ) . The Swiss charity `` the house of shreds '' ( das Brockenshaus ) is continuing this activity today according to the Bodelschwingh principles , collecting , repairing and reselling old clothes .   
 Friedrich von Bodelschwingh senior can be considered as the father of fundraising . Theodor Heuss would give him the nickname of the `` most resourceful beggar Germany had ever seen . ''   
 In 1951 , the German federal Post Office paid tribute by dedicating him a postage stamp .

 = Jacques Philippe Marie Binet =   
Jacques Philippe Marie Binet ( French : [ binɛ ] ; 2 February 1786 – 12 May 1856 ) was a French mathematician , physicist and astronomer born in Rennes ; he died in Paris , France , in 1856 . He made significant contributions to number theory , and the mathematical foundations of matrix algebra which would later lead to important contributions by Cayley and others . In his memoir on the theory of the conjugate axis and of the moment of inertia of bodies he enumerated the principle now known as Binet 's theorem . He is also recognized as the first to describe the rule for multiplying matrices in 1812 , and Binet 's Formula expressing Fibonacci numbers in closed form is named in his honour , although the same result was known to Abraham de Moivre a century earlier .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Binet graduated from l'École Polytechnique in 1806 , and returned as a teacher in 1807 . He advanced in position until 1816 when he became an inspector of studies at l'École . He held this post until 13 November 1830 , when he was dismissed by the recently crowned King Louis-Philippe of France , probably because of Binet 's strong support of the previous King , Charles X . In 1823 Binet succeeded Delambre in the chair of astronomy at the Collège de France . He was made a Chevalier in the Légion d'Honneur in 1821 , and was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1843 .

 = Stanis C5 82aw Frieda =  
Stanisław Frieda ( September 27, 1906 in Genać – February 26, 1992 in Lublin ) was a Polish-born physicist known for his contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics and his specific heats and the Friedmann–Boltzmann equations, and also for his experimental work in nuclear physics. He was a high-ranking member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and two officers of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Frieda served in the Polish diplomatic mission to the United States.  
 Frieda is notable for introducing the concept of a second derivative of a general theory and for the calculation of the Friedmann–Boltzmann equations. In 1955 Frieda was the first person to calculate the surface conditions for a nuclear chain reaction. In 1958 Frieda and Eliezer Liebig independently calculated the surface conditions for the `` Wild Swallow '' reactor at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, with a calculated critical mass. Frieda published the details of his calculation of the critical mass of the reactor, calculating it to be 4,200 × 10^-8. Frieda was the second nuclear physicist in history to have used the K-tube method.  
 Frieda married Aleksandra Rozwoski in 1952.

 = John Kingsbury (father) =  
John Kingsbury ( 20 November 1809 – 21 October 1890 ) was an English diplomat and Orientalist who served as Permanent Secretary of the United Kingdom in 1898–1899.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 John Kingsbury was born in Kirtland, Somerset, son of James Kingsbury, Governor of Westmorland from 1833, and Sarah ( b. 1831 ). He became very interested in languages, especially Arabic and Persian. He became friends with King Abdul Aziz, who arranged a private meeting with him in 1868 at the Court of St John, London, at which he met with Queen Victoria, her guardian angel. He shared their enthusiasm for studies in Egypt and Persia, and soon became one of the leading scholars of Arab literature in Britain. As a Member of Parliament ( MP ) he served on the 1922 Manchester Unionist-controlled Committee for a New Education, and later as Leader of the Labour Party in 1918.  
 Kingsbury then began a career as an economist and a diplomat in Europe. In 1860, he travelled to Constantinople to establish friendly relations with the Sultan, Mehmed III. During his time there, he was particularly interested in Bactria and the Transjordan, with the aim of improving its language and civilisation. In 1860, he was the first to explore western Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Syria ( on a £1000 expedition funded by the British Empire ), including Aqaba ( for the first time ever ), and obtained the subject for his Academy of Sciences. In 1863, he acted as an adviser to the Principal in Beijing on the preparation of the translation of Egyptian science and literature. He was active in the Egyptian-Roman War and in the campaigns of the Somme and the Crimean War, commanding troops in the Crimea. He became a member of the British House of Commons in 1870 and served as a Foreign Secretary for the 10th time in 1890.  
 During this period, he served as a member of the House of Lords, and in 1890 was chosen chairman of the Advisory Council on China.  
 In 1885, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and in 1899 a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1906 he was knighted.

 = Harry Turner =  
Harry Turner ( 12 February 1891 – 3 July 1966 ) was a British Anglican clergyman. He was a bishop of the Diocese of London, a fellow of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Doctor of Divinity, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was knighted in 1950 for services to church history. He died in London.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Turner was born at Derry, County Wicklow, Ireland. His father, born in Dublin in 1851, had emigrated to London from Ireland in 1858. Turner's mother, Ann, was born in 1858, in County Roscommon, Ireland. Ann Turner had been married to John Turner, 3rd Earl of Dunstable. Ann was the granddaughter of Dr. Walter Walter Turner, the ( 1794-1845 ) founding director of the Royal Irish Academy. She was the sister of the Rev. John E. Turner.  
   
   
 == Education and parish work ==  
 He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1911. He was then readmitted to Trinity College, Dublin ( later University College ) where he studied theology from 1912–18. He became a rector in the Diocese of London in 1918, and in 1921 to Trinity College, Dublin. He was elected to the Ireland diocesan parliament in 1922 and was re-elected alderman of Dublin in the 1929–30 by-elections. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in the 1921 to 1933. He died on 3 July 1966.  
   
   
 == Church history ==  
 Turner was active in the literary world and served as president of the Diocese of London Chapter of the Royal Irish Academy ( 1925–32 ). He was honorary rector of Trinity College from 1927 until his death. He was the first bishop of the Diocese of London to be ex officio Reader of Trinity College, Dublin, the first African-born bishop of the Diocese of London to be so honoured, and was awarded the Edgar Gale Memorial Medal of the Piety of Jesus Christ. Turner was also an active member of the Congregationalist communion.  
   
   
 == Church history in Ireland ==  
 In 1916 he became a member of the Board of the First Commission on Irish Churches, the first post-war commission on the Irish church to include representatives of the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church. The Commission met its initial deadline of December 30, 1918 and established a Temporary Conference to study the church in Ireland. On August 31, 1919 he published the Observations on the Church in Ireland, a paper in the Quarterly Review of the Annals of the Annuities and Antiquaries. This paper is still regarded as a major study of Irish church history and tradition.  
 As Bishop of Derry, Turner focused his efforts on the institutions of the Church, developing a unified and durable framework for its educational and religious life.He also instituted a parish school system, which was designed to provide all-female schools. Under his guidance, the convalescent colleges became localised classes of colleges with a greater focus on the developing baccalaureate and higher academic programmes. This was to form part of the church life in Ireland at the time.  
   
   
 == Church history in England ==  
 While serving as Dean of Trinity, Turner was involved in the development of education in Ireland and helped establish the Bishop's College ( which still exists today ) in Derry. This degree of autonomy greatly contributed to the growth of the diocesan school system in Ireland in terms of a greater ability to focus on the educational development of the young.  
   
   
 == Memorials ==  
 A collection of Harry Turner's papers and letters was donated to the library of Trinity College, Dublin in 2002.

Robert V. Simeon ( December 4, 1858, New York City - January 28, 1947 ) was a psychologist. Simeon was noted for his research on association learning in animals and in humans. He studied the effect of early and intense exposure to an unfamiliar and threatening sound. His findings were published in two papers published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London ( the most comprehensive English journal on psychology ).  
 Simeon also studied color vision, as revealed by polarized light. He developed a chromatic scale of color vision based on segmented images of pure hue. The scale provides a visual representation of the range of colors in the human visual system and also serves as an effective index of stimulus values, ranging from normal color vision to a first-order hyperpolarization.  
 His studies in color vision and associative learning were also important for scientists who studied art, and particularly painting, and both Theorie der Klasse und Handelungen ( Theorie of Color and Handwriting, 1887 ) and Gedichte der art ( Illustrated Art and Handcraft ) were translations of Russian publications and a critique of contemporary art, especially European art in general.Simeon's work was awarded the Rudolf Flahns Prize in 1896 for work `` illustrative of the origin of painting, and of its relation to that of another branch of art : sculpture ''.

 = Paul Christoph Hennings =   
Paul Christoph Hennings ( November 27 , 1841 – October 14 , 1908 ) was a German mycologist and herbarium curator . He discovered the study of cryptogams and mushrooms as a volunteer at the botanical garden . Although circumstances initially prevented him to study in that area , he later returned to natural sciences and eventually rose to a position at the largest herbarium in Germany . Originally interested in all non-higher plants , he specialised into mushrooms and became particularly versed in tropical species sent from abroad .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Borne in Heide , he was attracted early to plant sciences early and as a young man attracted the attention of director Ernst Ferdinand Nolte while a volunteer at the Botanischer Garten der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel . After an interlude caused by the Second Schleswig War , and during which he worked in the postal services . This job , which he abhorred , forced to move a number of times until he could settle in 1867 in Hohenwestedt , where he remained until 1874 . There he began lecturing at the Agricultural School ( German : Landwirtschaftsschule ) . He also began issuing exsiccatae and seed collections until Nolte 's successor , August W. Eichler , appointed him as an assistant . When Eichler went to work at the University of Berlin herbarium , he soon invited the younger man to join him . A complete autodidact , Hennings rose to become one of the foremost mycologists of his time , and particularly a specialist of tropical fungi thanks to the innumerable collections sent to Berlin from the German colonies and South America . He had two sons from his wife Mathilde , which he had married in 1876 , but lost one to illness in 1907 , which , in the words of his obituarist , `` paralyzed his energies and stole the pen from [ his ] busy hand '' . He died within a year .

 == Early life ==  
 Jones was born at Fishwick, Northamptonshire, the second son of Henry Jones, founder of Fishwick Bulb and Appel Centre, an ironworks in the villages of Weymouth, Northamptonshire, and Etruria. He was educated at Eton College and Emmanuel College, Oxford, and attended classes at Bath and the University of Cambridge. He travelled to Europe in 1781 and 1785. He returned to his native village and in 1787 he established the `` Bulb '' Company of Fishwick Bulb and Appel, which for his interest and innovation expanded into the `` Flygarden '' of three feet in height, standing on three feet two feet six inches in width, and occupying 75 acres ( 220 acres in the natural-historical district ). The `` Flygarden '' is the first and smallest agricultural area in England and was the first market garden in London. The production of fruit trees and vegetables, and the recording of England's nature was Jones's first fame and he soon became the garden's main visitor.In 1792 Jones succeeded James V. Hill on the overseership of the farm which had been opened to him for `` mineral trading. ''

He applied to the parliament for a series of licenses for mines on land in England and in Wales. He also travelled extensively in Europe to attend meetings of the scientific society.  
 Jones was a skilled botanist, and some of his discoveries date from his time in Europe, including the discovery of the strange-shaped strawberries, commonly known as `` Jones'strawberries. '' In 1805 he published `` An Account of an Early Treasures-Table of Agriculture in the Midlands and at Liverpool, drawn up by Mr Andrew Jones, with an Account of the Curative properties of Saltpetre in Cornes. With a Vegetable-Suffix... ( Some years after he had lost the use of his left hand, in consequence of an accident of an ear ) '' ( original title : How We Shall Grow Corn, or, A Plain View of our Vocation of Radish Gardening, with an Account of the Cure of Severe

He also served as Secretary of the Advisory Committee on Equality of Opportunity for the Comission for Equality and Sustenance. He is also commemorated by the joint name of the Mendelson School of Economic Sciences and Mendelson Institute, the first integrated economics and social science school in England.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Philip Mendelson was born on 22 January 1892, the only son of Florence Compton Mendelson ( 1871–1961 ), a printer and secretary, and her husband James Cecil Mendelson. The Mendelson family moved to Peterborough, England in 1899 when their great-great-grandfather Hugh Compton Mendelson and several of his family had fled Nazi Germany in order to escape persecution.  
 Mendelson was educated at the University of Cambridge. He became a member of the Lord Rennie Fund for Oxford University at the end of World War I and served as its vice-president. In 1918, he became a close friend of Alfred Marshall, the same year he became Oxford's new President. The money donated by this aid enabled both schools to increase in size from a couple of dozen to 12 to twelve hundred staff. The Mendelson Institute was given its own building at Wandsworth. Mendelson retired in 1941 and was succeeded as Chairman by Edmond Rees-Mogg. In 1945, when the Institute had finished its first year of operation, it was `` appointed an auxiliary member '' of the School of Economic Science of the University of St Andrews, Scotland, in recognition of its vigorous missionary work and her work with educational workers in the rural areas. He and his brother Carl lived there for nearly four decades, becoming a permanent community of 30,000 in Dumfries and Galloway. Mendelson died at home in Oxford on 4 February 1961.  
   
   
 == The Nobel Prize for Economics ==  
 In 1955, Mendelson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics `` for discoveries which have made it possible to construct entirely new empirical theories of economics and to make predictions about changes in the national economy ''. He had received only a small fraction of the Nobel Prize money, of which 35,000 were awarded to pay his brother Carl. The committee called for 16 distinguished economists to nominate a winner, and Mendelson was chosen as the winner. Mendelson was elected President of the Sociology Department in 1951.

 = Daniel Becker =  
Daniel Becker ( German : [ baʁɔ̃ bʁesh ] ; January 6, 1881 – October 11, 1965 ) was a German economic historian. He was the dean of the Faculty of Arts at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Stuttgart, and the main author of two books about the German economy, My Germany and The Dictatorship of the Jews. Becker wrote on most German economic topics, including comparative studies, taxation and economics.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Daniel Becker was born on January 6, 1881, in Vienna. His family immigrated to Vienna in 1885, then followed it to Germany.  
 Becker studied philosophy and German at the University of Würzburg, and wrote on political economy. Becker finished his studies in Leipzig in 1907.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Becker worked as an economic consultant for the Royal Bank of Austria, the Deutsche Bank and the Standard Bank of Austria ( which merged into the Deutsche Bundesbank in 1927 ). Becker also was responsible for developing the Austrian treatment of the People's Republic of China. Becker published many books, including My Germany and The Dictatorship of the Jews, to explain the relationship between capitalism and the second-class status of Jews in Germany.  
 In 1928 Becker published a book in German entitled Rhetoric of Capitalistic Production : Die Statistik der Erscheinungen der gegenwartlichen Preussischen und Insel ( The Economy of a State, the State as an Instrument of Capitalist Production ). Becker concluded that the German state, through its policies and economic institutions, is essentially a measure of the meritocracy of capitalism and racial supremacism.From 1928 to 1931, Becker chaired the Technical Commission for the Economic Affairs of Poland. From 1933 to 1939, Becker served as director of the Economics Ministry's European Development Department.  
 Becker died in Stuttgart on October 11, 1965.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Becker was one of the first German scholars to develop a comparative perspective on economics. He emphasized the comparative values of the Western democracies, their methods of social and economic development, and their historical development. He developed the notion of the equalizer concept in economics as an analytical way to distinguish between higher economic development within a country and slower economic development in a country without such a development.  
 Becker's account of the effects of political, social, economic, and geographic factors on economic growth deals with many different people and institutions, ranging from individual and family life and political life to the development of bureaucracies and diplomacy. Becker writes that while others `` tended to diminish the significance of differences and insignificance '' of individual differences as to economic development, the main factors are those with `` major social and political consequences ''.  
 Becker wrote that as history unfolds, the ability to develop some countries, the ability to develop others, and the ability to recover the rest will depend on the development of democratic capitalism. Becker thought that inter-national competition among nations should lead to `` progressive social development '', but that further development is always and necessarily directed toward strengthening democratic capitalism and diminishing the privileges of the privileged.  
   
   
 == Students ==  
 Becker was well known as a teacher, both in Germany and in Switzerland. A student named Hans Gross commented that Becker was the first person to use the term reformist and productive. Hans Gross was a particularly important influence on Becker, as Gross had developed economic theories based on various aspects of the post-industrial development.

 = Max Schindler =  
Max Schindler ( 7 February 1743 – 26 May 1796 ) was a German physicist and mathematician.  
 Schindler was born in Freiberg ( today : Große Anhalt ), Silesia. Schindler's brother Johann was the son of mathematician Julius Maria von Schindler. He matriculated from Freiberg in 1773. His mother died after seven years at an early age. At age 14, Schindler won the State Prize of the Ordo Templi Orientis ( predecessor of the University of Heidelberg ) for his geometry examination, and in the same year he won the Freiberg Città-Aristarchadis ( Ferghana Prize ) from the Province of Jura. This earned him an eulogy from his father-in-law, Bishop Antoine Pierre Bothe. Schindler received a university education, and studied chemistry, physiology, and mathematics under Joseph Davy, who was a student of Alphonse Le Caire. While in Jura, Schindler developed an interest in Roman mechanics. In 1789 he published his first written paper on heat balance. He made his academic return to Freiberg in 1800. From 1800 to 1802, Schindler taught at the University of Freiberg, and at the Prussian Polytechnic ( later the University of Würzburg ) from 1803 to 1806.  
 In 1807, Schindler became lecturer in physics at the University of Freiberg. At the request of Georg Cantor, Schindler became the third professor of mathematics at the University of Jura, which he occupied until 1814. He was professor of mathematics at the University of Freiberg from 1813 until his death. He was the father of the German mathematician Ernst von Schindler.  
 The Albert Einstein ’ s 1948 equation that describes light speed as the product of wavelength and frequency is named after him as well as Schindler's law, `` a statistical consequence ''. The European Center for Nuclear Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom, which is named after him, was founded in his honor.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Max von Schindler was the son of physicist Julius Maria von Schindler ( 1704-1791 ) and his wife, Maria Catharina ( 1727-1794 ). The daughter of the historian Johann Christian Gottfried von Schindler ( 1696-1764 ), she was the niece of Mathilde Gauss, son of the Lutheran theologian Johann Gauss ( who died in 1709 ). The other members of his family were Bartholin ( 1696-1735 ), Marburg ( 1698-1751 ), Countess Johanna von Schindler-Wallenberg ( 1725-1785 ), and Count August von Schindler ( 1729-1791 ).

Alain Manesson Mallet ( 1630–1706 ) was a French cartographer and engineer . He started his career as a soldier in the army of Louis XIV , became a Sergeant-Major in the artillery and an Inspector of Fortifications . He also served under the King of Portugal , before returning to France , and his appointment to the court of Louis XIV . His military engineering and mathematical background led to his position teaching mathematics at court.His major publications were Description de L'Univers ( 1683 ) in 5 volumes , and Les Travaux de Mars ou l'Art de la Guerre ( 1684 ) in 3 volumes .   
 His Description de L'Universe contains a wide variety of information , including star maps , maps of the ancient and modern world , and a synopsis of the customs , religion and government of the many nations included in his text . It has been suggested that his background as a teacher led to his being concerned with entertaining his readers . This concern manifested itself in the charming harbour scenes and rural landscapes that he included beneath his description of astronomical concepts and diagrams . Mallet himself drew most of the figures that were engraved for this book .

 On October 9 , 1941 , shortly before the United States entered World War II , President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a crash program to develop the atomic bomb . The key raw material for the project was uranium , which was used as fuel for the reactors , as feed that was transformed into plutonium , and , in its enriched form , in the atomic bomb itself . There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940 : in Colorado , in northern Canada , in Joachimsthal in Czechoslovakia , and in the Belgian Congo . A professor at Columbia University , Kerr was seconded to work on the Manhattan Project , tasked with locating and procuring supplies of uranium . As part of this assignment , he traveled to Katanga Province in the Belgian Congo , he also visited and assessed the Canadian Eldorado deposit on Great Bear Lake , and the vanadium mines of the Colorado Plateau . Kerr 's association with the Manhattan Project and later with the Atomic Energy Commission continued until late in the Cold War .

 He was born in Edinburgh . His parents possessed considerable landed property in Midlothian . Educated partly in the University of Edinburgh and partly in France , Italy and Switzerland , and early acquiring an interest in natural history , he benefited greatly by acquaintance with foreign languages and literature , and with men of science in different countries.He was induced in 1837 , through the influence of Leopold von Buch , to devote his special attention to the brachiopoda , and in course of time he became the highest authority on this group . The great task of his life was the Monograph of British Fossil Brachiopoda , published by the Palaeontographical Society ( 1850–1886 ) . This work , with supplements , comprises six quarto volumes with more than 200 plates drawn on stone by the author .   
 He also prepared an exhaustive memoir on Recent Brachiopoda , published by the Linnean Society . He monographed the entire series of Brachiopoda collected by HMS Challenger.Davidson benefited from an introduction to Elizabeth Gray by John Young in 1865 . Gray had a lifelong interest in the fossils of Girvan in Scotland . Her family took their holidays there each year and they would devote their time to gathering cleaning and labelling fossils . Gray had some basic geology training , but she preferred to let others do the scientific descriptions . Gray would send collections of fossils , including brachiopoda , regularly over several years between 1867 and 1885.He was elected fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1852 and in 1865 awarded their Wollaston medal . He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1857 , and in 1870 received a Royal medal from the Royal Society . In 1882 , the degree of LL.D . was conferred upon him by the University of St Andrews.He died at Brighton on 14 October 1885 , bequeathing his fine collection of recent and fossil brachiopoda to the British Museum .

 = Frederick John Tupper =  
Frederick John Tupper ( 4 August 1814 – 22 April 1885 ) was an Irish landowner and political activist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Tupper was born on 4 August 1814 at Aylesbury. He was educated at Maidstone Grammar School, then attended Westminster School. In the evenings he attended rugby matches, and also frequented the countryside. Tupper's father was an Irish Republican who was active in the Red Cross. Tupper became an active political activist in the League of Nations in 1872, when he worked on the Committee on Claims to the West Indies.  
 Tupper is most notable for his `` standing stone of scientific and cultural values '' and for the Tupper Prize, given for `` excellence in the past, present and future. '' His political activity was cut short when he was elected Member of Parliament for Varick, County Dublin, in 1872. The party lost the seat, but he was re-elected to the Irish Parliament in 1879.  
   
   
 == Political career ==  
 Tupper made his political capital through his connection with the League of Nations, with whom he had worked previously in the drafting of its rules. The League had formally dissolved after the civil war in Ireland in 1867. Tupper ran unsuccessfully in the elections of 1868 and 1870 for the seat of Varick in East Tyrone, on the Isle of Mull. He retained this seat from 1870 until 1876 when he retired, but was re-elected in the election of 1876.  
 He returned to his village of Aylesbury in 1878, where he built a large house on his property, designed by architect William Bessemer. Tupper, who was greatly interested in the natural history of the district, invited the prominent Irish photographer and naturalist John Victor Clarke to begin work on a survey of the area. The resulting report, 'A Natural History of an Irish Rural Area ', was published in 1879. The resulting discoveries resulted in an Irish Antiquarian-Naturalist's House, erected in 1882.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 During his time at Aylesbury, Tupper also got involved in political activism in Ireland. In 1882 he and the agricultural economist Thomas John Watson co-founded the Central Committee of the Ulster Free Trade Union.  
 When David Lloyd George, who was negotiating a peace treaty between Britain and Ireland, secured support for breaking off the process in May 1885, it was in part Tupper who spoke out against the recent peace. In a series of letters, Tupper revealed the extent to which the `` split '' between the British and Irish public was being worked out. He wrote :  
   
 For the past half-century the English public have never acknowledged the essential significance of the Alliance with the Irish. The facts, indeed the whole pattern of British action since the War of Independence have been obscure, the minds of many observers have been split, and, because of the approach of the Government, when it began in the new year the result was something like a world-wide shock.  
 In later life Tupper worked in Kildare on behalf of Irish interests in the Irish community. He was also a member of the Board of Trade of Ireland, the Irish Committee of War, the Irish Labour Party, the Post Office and many others.Tupper died at his home in a cemetery on 22 April 1885. His health had improved, and his papers are now lost. The grave lies near to a collection of tuberculosis notes.

 = Dimitri Navachine =   
Dimitri Navachine ( Дмитрий Сергеевич Навашин , 30 August 1889 – 25 January 1937 ) was a Russian politician and economist . He governed the BCEN-Eurobank in France from 1927 to 1929 . In addition , he served as a consultant to the French Popular Front to offer advice on combating the economic crisis in France . Ideologically , Navachine was a socialist but his politics and theories were more closely associated with the Popular Front , not Marxism–Leninism . Although well-respected for his economic views in France , Navachine nonetheless created many enemies both there and in the Soviet Union . He was assassinated in 1937 but his case still remains unsolved .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Dimitri Navachine was born in Moscow on 30 August 1889 . After the February Revolution in 1917 , he was assigned to the vice presidency of the Red Cross under Alexander Kerensky 's newly formed Russian Provisional Government to oversee the treatment of German prisoners during World War I . Perhaps due to his experience with economics and his invaluable connections in the West , Navachine managed to stay in good favor with the Communist Party when it seized power late in 1917 , despite being a Kerensky supporter . At first critical of the new government , Navachine nonetheless assisted with restoring the country 's economy , devastated by war and revolution . The Soviets ' first important assignment for Navachine was to send him to Spain in 1921 ; as a diplomat , Navachine negotiated with Spain to exchange its petroleum reserves with the Soviet Union rather than Royal Dutch Shell.In 1927 , Navachine was assigned to Paris to assume the directorship of BCEN Eurobank which was responsible for the Soviet Union 's financial matters in France . He resigned from the position in 1929 and either worked for or with a group of right-wing bankers connected to the Banque Worms . After Joseph Stalin 's rise to power , Navachine elected to remain in France , advising the French Popular Front , a political party that shared his ideological views , during France 's economic crisis in the 1930s . Léon Blum 's economic minister Charles Spinasse collaborated closely with Navachine who also published a two-volume study on the issue . Well-respected for his input , Navachine counseled Spinasse to disband the industrial cartels in France .   
    
 Some historians insist , despite claims by Navachine that he cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1929 , he engaged in espionage on behalf of the Soviet government . French detectives , however , could find no evidence of him engaging in acts of espionage beyond the early 1930s . By 1937 , having already declined a summons to return to Moscow , Navachine was faced with open hostility from Soviet agents . Worse still , he created enemies with anti-Semitic groups who were aware of his counsel in final political parties.On the morning of 25 January 1937 , while walking his fox terrier dog in Bois de Boulogne , Navachine was assassinated , stabbed to death in an incident still unsolved by French police ; he was 47 years of age . His assassination has been connected to at least three other murders carried out during a state of ongoing violence in France : Italian anti-fascist dissidents Carlo and Nello Rosselli , and undercover agent Laetitia Nourrissat Toureaux . Panteleimon Takhchiyanov , an officer of the NKVD , is suspected to have carried out Navachine 's assassination , possibly to silence him before he released evidence proving the innocence of Soviet political prisoners . Another theory argues his attack was coordinated by the fascist extremist group La Cagoule to create fears of Communist conspirators in France.His remains are interred at Montrouge Cemetery .

 = Sergei Tabachenko =  
Sergei Ivanovich Tabachenko ( Russian : Эди́нович Фа́нович Аверсков ; 10 September 1897 – 1 June 1989 ) was a Soviet scholar and linguist. He worked at the Bolshoi Gosudarstvennoe Academy ( BGA ).  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Tabachenko was born in Kazan, Russia, the son of a lawyer and a pedagogue. He began his studies in music at Kazan University ( 1895 ), and graduated with a second place in the second class in 1911.In 1913, Tabachenko took up a position at the Institute of Military Education in Kazan, as head of the music department, and continued with his studies at the university after completing his military training. At that time, the Institute of Military Education ( with its 2,000 students ) housed the Kazan Philharmonic Society. In 1914, he was appointed head of the faculty at the university. His position allowed him to travel abroad and to establish contacts.  
   
 In 1924, Tabachenko's further studies at BGA were interrupted by the Second World War. A year later, he joined the New BGA under Soviet State Control. He wrote several works on the history of Russian poetry, writing Harmony of Minds in 1941 and Musical Deprivations in 1946. In the course of the war, Tabachenko went through his period of radicalisation. He became an active member of the left wing Communist Party, and started a revolutionary journal, Provinstva Narodniia, which published pamphlets sympathetic to the Soviet government, particularly the Mejlis and the Communist Front. The editorial board of Provinstva Narodniia included two members of the Committee of People's Commissars of the Moscow Military District.  
   
 In 1942, Tabachenko was dismissed from the university and expelled from the Soviet Union.In March 1943, the Soviet government denied him his permanent position at the university. But, in a letter to Trotsky, the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev appealed for a civilian position for Tabachenko and gave priority to all other candidates. After a period of over three years, Tabachenko was finally offered a professorship at the Kharkiv Academic Center of Musicology in March 1946. As an Academician, he taught at the Theoretical Institute, and also at the Kharkiv State University.  
 His former pupil Karel Bogdanov recalled to The Moscow Times his first meeting with Tabachenko at Kharkiv. `` He was clearly in charge of the school of music, the concert hall, and orchestra. He had complete authority over everything in the building, and the administrators were afraid to screw him. '' He also recounted the experience of Ernest Bechdel, who met Tabachenko while he was studying at the Institute. `` I was in a familiar atmosphere, and we were able to watch television together, and that one would bring something out.... I think he introduced me to modern music, and I became a fan of its knowledge. '' In 1956, he was honored by virtue of the designation `` the professor of the administration of the Kharkiv University ''. In 1953, he was made a corresponding member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences of the Soviet Union.The Kharkiv state university named in his honor the Mikhailovsky-Tabachenko Building, which serves as the headquarters of the Faculty of Musicology.  
   
   
 == Postwar years ==  
 Tabachenko wrote several books and many articles on the history of Russian poetry, later collecting them into volume 19 of his Dialogues with the Poets, published in 1957. He died on 1 June 1989. His son Vladimir Issikovich Tabachenko became a prominent pedagogue in Slavic languages.

 == Career ==   
 Samuel ran a Paris seminar during the 1960s , and became Professeur émérite at the Université Paris-Sud ( Orsay ) . His lectures on unique factorization domains published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research played a significant role in computing the Picard group of a Zariski surface via the work of Jeffrey Lang and collaborators . The method was inspired by earlier work of Nathan Jacobson and Pierre Cartier another outstanding member of the Bourbaki group . Nicholas Katz related this to the concept of p-curvature of a connection introduced by Alexander Grothendieck .   
 He was a member of the Bourbaki group , and filmed some of their meetings . A French television documentary on Bourbaki broadcast some of this footage in 2000 .   
 Samuel was also active in issues of social justice , including concerns about environmental degradation ( where he was influenced by Grothendieck ) , and arms control . He died in Paris in August 2009.His doctoral students include Lucien Szpiro and Daniel Lazard .

 = Leon J. Wood =   
Leon James Wood ( 1918–1977 ) was an American theologian .   
 He is the author of one of the few books on the Holy Spirit as portrayed in the Old Testament as opposed to the New Testament . Wood wrote , `` The evidence that spiritual renewal , or regeneration , was true of such Old Testament people lies mainly in two directions . One is that these people lived in a way possible only for those who had experienced regeneration , and the other is the avenue of logical deduction that argues back from New Testament truth . `` According to Wood , the Scripture stated that the Holy Spirit God is omnipresent and necessary in the current age prior to the Church 's Rapture and the Great Tribulation , for imparting a new life `` to those who trust Christ as their Saviour '' . His action mainly differs from the past in that the Holy Spirit `` will cease one aspect of His work , namely , the restraint of sin in the world '' ( 2Thess 2:7 ) .   
    
    
 == Education ==   
 Wood was educated at Calvin Theological Seminary with graduate studies in Israel through New York University and at the Oriental Institute , Chicago . He received his Ph.D. degree from Michigan State University .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 The Seminary building of Cornerstone University 's Grand Rapids Theological Seminary , where Wood taught Old Testament Studies for many years ( 1946–1975 ) and served as Academic Dean ( 1952–1973 ) , is named the Leon J . Wood Seminary Building in his honor in 1977.From 1973 to 1977 , Wood served as a translator/editor on the project which resulted in the creation of the New International Version ( NIV ) of the Bible.Wood is best known for his advocacy and promotion of the controversial `` gap theory '' of Creation Science and his spirited defence of the plenary inspiration of Scripture . Several of Dr. Wood 's books were published in the two or three years following his 1977 death .

 = Isaac Scholz =  
Isaac Scholz ( German : [ ssəɐŋks ] ; 1781 – 4 June 1822 ) was a German neuroanatomist and physiologist. Scholz discovered in 1781 that the placement of the brain on the cornea creates a sort of surface's membrane that surrounds the brain and allows colour information from different parts of the brain to be projected onto a separate 'vasculature'( der veschleit ). He also discovered that the number of filaments that carry visual information from the eye to the retina can be increased by decreasing the number of connected sensory fibres.  
 Scholz'discovery was praised by Carl Ludwig van Dusen, the founder of modern vertebrate physiology, who wrote :  
   
 Dr. Scholz's single discovery, in the sense in which it is now recognized, was with force and beauty as extraordinary as that of Blaise Pascal : for it seemed to awaken a desire in all thinkers, and to elevate the sublime against mere poetry. Its importance is not in quantity, but in its value.  
 Scholz'discoveries subsequently spread through Europe, and are now known as `` Scholz's law '', although he actually proposed it as a method for testing the physiology of animals. His work is still used today, for example in phycology.Scholz's reputation as a neuroanatomist did not last, however. In 1820, shortly before his death from tuberculosis, Scholz's son, Johann Georg Scholz, married a woman, the first cousin of his nephew, Benjamin Scholz. Historians believe that the war-time laws and superstitions that Scholz brought back from his exile in China, introduced by his son, reinforced the father's image as the ideal ancestor of modern neurology.Another nephew, Gottlieb von Schmidt ( 1796-1850 ), became a neuroanatomist. He proposed that a distinction was made between parts of the human brain as innate and acquired as a byproduct of physiological development, rather than created in an evolutionary process. Schmidt's experimental method of removing damaged parts of the brain led to a great growth in both understanding of brain function and in this area of neurobiology. The possibility that different parts of the brain are related to one another or the environment was one of the central ideas of his philosophy. He took his ideas further by showing that the subdivisions of the human brain were products of accidental circumstance in combination with structural causes.

 = Alvaro Alonso Barba =   
Alvaro Alonso Barba was a secular Catholic priest and metallurgist .   
 Antonio ( 1786 ) says , `` Baeticus ex oppido Lepe , apud Potosi '' ; hence Barba is assumed to be of Andalusian origin , from the ancient Roman province of Baetica . From the words Lepe and Potosi , Lipes in western Bolivia might be indicated .   
 He lived at Potosi during the period when its silver mines were most productive and luxury among the Spanish residents and mine owners had nearly reached its height . Father Barba divided his time between his priestly duties and a close study of the ores of this region and their treatment . There had been , since 1570 , a complete revolution in the treatment of silver ores , through the application of mercury , and a number of improvements followed , of which Barba had knowledge .   
 In 1609 , he invented the pan amalgamation process ( in Spanish the cazo or fondo process ) for extracting silver from ore by mixing it with salt and mercury and heating it in shallow copper vessels . In 1640 he published in Madrid a book entitled Arte de los Metales , the earliest work on South American ores and minerals . It includes information on mineral localities in Bolivia . The book has been republished in Spanish , French , English and German .

 = Jerzy Zachary Fick =  
Jerzy Zachary Fick ( 27 March 1875 – 8 May 1967 ) was a Polish-born American industrialist, lawyer, and political activist, the nephew of Polish-American mathematician Joseph Szilard. Fick is regarded as a pioneer of mathematical economics in the United States.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Fick was born to Polish parents in Naskowiec, Belarus, the son of a judge of the local council, named Jerzy Zachary, and his wife, Gertrude. His father was an attorney. After finishing high school, Fick went to Petersburg to study law. He then attended Lemberg University where he was elected to a physics physics faculty and pursued a long career in physics research. In 1912 he was made director of a university near Kraków, where he remained for the rest of his life. He then went to Paris for further study and returned to Poland to practice law.  
 He had to wait a year in Paris before returning to Kraków. From 1908 to 1915 he worked in the bar in the city of Korczak, working for a bank and negotiating labor contracts for Jewish peasants and workers. He later worked as a private practice lawyer in Oplitch, and finally became the head of the office of labor relations.  
 In 1918 he was arrested at his home by police and taken to Pernikowska prison in Smolensk, where he stayed for three months before being released. At the end of the war he resumed his legal practice at Magyar Sokolovka and defended the interests of the `` The Order of Mac Caspian '', a group of Polish and Soviet Jews, against attacks from anti-Jewish sentiments. He died in 1937 from esophageal cancer, aged 81.  
 Fick's greatest contribution to mathematical economics was the Ponzi scheme ( as much as a play on the spelling of `` Pyeat '', which was compulsory for university enrollment ) that the Jewish-American Václav Havel believed he was able to deploy against the people who had built up the property market following the defeat of the Polish Provisional Government. However, this scheme made the impact of its success more immediate than the Ponzi scheme. During the First World War, Ramiro Menéndez described Fick as `` an economist of the highest quality... and on the boundary between Jew and capitalist. ``  
   
   
 == Positions ==  
 Fick spent much of his career in the United States. In 1920 he became a research fellow at the University of Chicago, then transferred to Princeton, New Jersey in 1930, where he worked with economist J. E. B. Keller, and of course with the distinguished theoretical economists Peter Hassler and John Kenneth Galbraith. He also joined the board of trustees of Case Western Reserve University in 1932 and became director of its Industrial Research Center. The faculty member and emeritus professor of law at Columbia University from 1938 to 1942, Fick lectured on the theory of real estate at the Harvard Graduate School of Business and at the Columbia School of Forestry and Environmental Studies in the United States from 1948 to 1967. He also advised President Harry Truman on trade and war issues, and he was an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson.In 1921 Fick obtained for himself a membership of the Académie des sciences et métiers in Paris. In 1926 he became a foreign member of the Société Mathématique de France.Fick retired in 1956, after which he lived in Greenwich Village, Connecticut, with his wife and his seven children. In 1962 he moved to Chicago, where he was a professor emeritus at the DePaul University Law School. During the 1960s he worked on a joint labor settlement between the United Auto Workers and the United Mine Workers of America.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Born to a wealthy Jewish family in Naskowiec, Belarus, Fick married Julia Peyman in the United States in 1895, in the year of the founding of the Nazi Party. He died in 1963, and in 1967 his papers and those of his family were transferred to the National Archives in Washington D.C., where he was buried in an unmarked grave.

 = Benjamin Daniel Price =  
Benjamin Daniel Price, FRSE ( 21 December 1831 – 10 February 1907 ) was a Scottish geologist and meteorologist who became a noted author in the field.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Price was born in Morningside, Perthshire, Scotland, and educated at Balmau Castle School in the Low Countries, graduating with a First Class BSc degree in 1871. He went to London and then to Aberdeen, where he studied at Queen's University and University of Edinburgh.  
 After working as a demonstrator in educational administration at Aberdeen he went to Edinburgh, where he succeeded his uncle, Thomas Erskine Price. In the autumn of 1873, Price returned to Edinburgh and became the geologist for the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was elected Fellow in 1875 and became Senior Lecturer in 1880. He taught courses in geology and meteorology for the Board of Scientific Management of the Royal Scottish Geological Survey. In 1887, at the age of sixty-one, he was succeeded as Geologist to the Board. In 1889 he took up the post of Deputy Chief of the Geological Survey. His work was supervised by James Somerville Douglas, who was a distinguished meteorologist. In 1900, he retired from the board and took up a position as a professor of geography at the College of Agriculture in Fife.  
 In 1899 he published a paper on the flow of the Cenozoic Lake Daniell, as it flowed through the Aberdeenshire Highlands. In this paper he detailed a variety of possible changes in local geography due to the impact of the moon and through the presence of man. The paper was first published in the Philosophical Magazine and was translated into three languages : Chinese, English and German.  
 His book Global Cohesion : Stages and Figures of Change in the Pattern of Origin and Evolution of Rivers, laid the foundation for the geomorphological classification of water streams. It was a major contribution to the geomorphological classification of rivers and in 1923 it was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Medal. He was a founder of the Geology Department at Aberdeen University, where he lectured on the geology of different parts of Scotland.  
 Price died on 10 February 1907 at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, aged 82.

 = J. B. Calkins =  
John Baxter Bruchich Calkins ( January 21, 1866 – April 8, 1936 ) was an American economist who studied the effects of pure and applied factors in the financial markets. He is best known for his pioneering paper, `` A Statistical Analysis of the Housing Market ''.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
   
 Calkins was born in Detroit, Michigan and studied at Clark University for two years. During his undergraduate studies, he made a mathematical calculation to create the statistical likelihood formula that accounts for wide variation in patterns of the trend in house prices, by reviewing paper by Peter Ewald. During his law degree, Calkins studied banking cases, in particular, one involving a Chinese national, an accounting fraud case, and other similar challenges. During this time, he considered graduate school in mathematical economics, but he passed a combination of the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University. In April 1888 he received a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins with a dissertation on natural values. During the next two decades, he served as a dean of Johns Hopkins'College of Arts and Sciences, and was a professor at Temple University.  
 He was later made assistant to William Longey of the Virginia Board of Elections, serving until 1902. Calkins retired from that post, but continued as head of the board of elections. He then left as chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania in 1907, and later at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  
   
   
 == Career at the Federal Reserve and academia ==  
 In 1913, after studying for the summer at Columbia University, Calkins became assistant to William Du Bois, a fellow young economist. Du Bois began to arrange with him a series of scientific papers on mathematical analysis of structural problems in the financial markets, and he and Calkins took a joint trip to the United States. Calkins devoted the rest of his career to public debate on monetary policy, which was quickly noted as a promising field for study.  
 He was a frequent lecturer at Oxford University, and his main area of research was the application of statistical techniques to industry and finance. He wrote the textbooks for mathematical economics for more than forty years, including Is There a Government Unemployed? and Economics, the New Order, also called High Society : Essays in Accounting and Statistics.  
 He was a longtime collaborator with J. Prescott Howe. Calkins died in 1936, at the age of 78, after spending nearly a decade in a nursing home, in Los Angeles.

Emma Maria Wolffhardt ( born 27 . July 1899 , died 1997 ) was a German Industrial Chemist at BASF and she was the first women chemist at BASF who had her own research area . Furthermore , she was the first to use the carlotte model for understanding and improving organic synthesis .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Wolffhardt studied at the University of Würzburg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology . She did her doctorate with Stefan Goldschmidt . Wolffhardt started her career at BASF in 1925 . At first , she had to work in the literature office of the main laboratory . She was very unhappy in this job because she was not allowed to work in research . Months later , Alwin Mittasch , who was head of the laboratory at the time , searched for an assistant , and Wolffhardt applied and was appointed Mittasch assistant . Then , she supported Mittasch in his scientific work . In 1940 , she received her own research area , where she researched the production of aviation fuel . She was the first to use the calotte model for understanding and improving organic synthesis . In this way , Wolffhardt was the first German researcher to archieve a yield of 8-10 % for triptane . In 1950 , Wolffhardt was the first women university graduate in the history of the company who celebrated her 25th anniversary . In 1960 , she retired . She died 1997 in Heidelberg . She had an adopted daughter .

 = Malte H C3 B6mayer =  
Malte Henri Christian Hämayer ( 16 December 1836, Halle – 5 July 1920, Halle ) was a German anatomist, who worked mostly in a nearby town.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hämayer was born in Halle into a Christian family. He studied medicine at the University of Göttingen and Vienna, where he received his doctorate in 1874. In 1876, he became an assistant physician of the clinic in Seelau and later worked as an assistant surgeon at the Halle Anatomical Institute, and as assistant professor at the anatomical clinic of his friend and colleague Hans Blässer at the University of Halle.After his retirement, Hämayer took up the post of member of the Halle zu Steinhausen clinic. He worked with Blässer until 1891, when Blässer and Blässer moved on to the University of Leipzig.  
 Hämayer worked in Leipzig as a neurologist, and then on the same post at Halle.Among his research interests was pyometra, the classification of heart lesions. Hämayer was a close associate of Hans Blässer, although they were sometimes at loggerheads over the years over topics. Hämayer worked on the classification of bacterial species of the genus Memza, also known as botulism. He proposed that the pyometra of the species of the genus Memza were pyometra because they were infectious bacteria.During his career, Hämayer edited, contributed to, and contributed to other scientific journals. His greatest contribution to science came in the field of vasaesthesia, or `` mind reading ''. Hämayer used it to `` break down '' speech and understand what it was that was spoken about. It was inspired by that of the famous neurologist J.S. Lister and influenced the work of numerous German neurologists.
