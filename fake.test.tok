== early life and education ==
hendrick was born in kirkby , in 1868 , into a family of musicians . his father , henry lewis hendrick , was a music teacher . he studied composition and music in glasgow and at the musica mathematica college in edinburgh where he studied under charles bain , with whom he was lifelong friends . in 1876 he became first in his class to obtain a first class in music . he then returned to scotland to attend the conservatorium of music in lisburn , where his father continued to instruct students . he then enrolled at the university of glasgow , where he was influenced by the experimental and the thinking of percy bysshe shelley and the st. john of the cross school of scots , which pioneered the teaching of classical music .


== career ==
the biographer john grey , who knew hendrick and his family well , recollects : `` that hendrick had a distinctive voice was recognised long before the word ever filtered out of his lips . his syllables [ were ] pitch sensitive , and his phrasing would suggest one pitch of the way to distinguish between the words of musical thought . even at this early stage , he understood what shelley , in his two earliest plays , meant by that word 'heart '' '.initially he was taught by lewis macfarlane . in 1911 hendrick took a university course in classical singing ( at that time called horn singing ) under george taylor and was an expert horn-singing student , until being offered an invitation to join the girton museum , the university of london 's geological research unit . although he was not a great amateur horn player , he acquired the skills needed for the task . he trained in the field under dr. charles bain in the summers of 1906 and 1909 . at girton hendrick was first to build a life-size model of sir thomas herriot 's geological epigraph for his son , the geologist james herriot . the grave marker at girton also reads `` l.h . dreyfuss `` .

in 1912 hendrick became the curator of the geological society of london . he was also active in the `` corps for the protection of mammals and birds `` , the public advisory council for the forest reserve , and was made an honorary fellow of the royal geological society of london in 1910.hendrick retired from the geological society in 1915 , having made an `` earnest effort to give to science the basic measures of science as a distinct science `` . in 1917 hendrick returned to girton , where he continued to work in the museum until his retirement in 1920 . he taught zoology to the boys at girton . he served on the geological society 's committee on entomology in 1932-1935 and on the geological research committee in 1937-1940 . hendrick lived for a time at mount head , a popular recreation .
hendrick and his wife clara moved to the english countryside in 1919 and lived at irmin nambour in athlone , where he dedicated his life to the protection of public birds . in 1937 his work was recognised by the wildlife trust of great britain.he died at girton , in his native gartown , on 19 october 1943 .

oleksandr konstantinovich preobrazhensky ( russian : николай андре́й андрович новной , ; 20 october 1902 – 15 april 1987 ) was a soviet geologist .


== biography ==
preobrazhensky was born on 20 october 1902 in besansky , ukraine , into a family of prominent men in the banking industry . he attended besansky gymnasium ( russian : пергелогич кунса ) , where he was a student of vladimir sedevik . his father eduard preobrazhensky was the leading banker and an influential member of the soviet elite . another son , oleg preobrazhensky was also a leading figure in the banking industry , and , like his father , was a patriarch in the besansky community . at besansky , oleksandr spent his early years getting a normal education . his second year he went to besansky polytechnic institute to study philosophy . when preobrazhensky graduated from besansky , he chose to continue his education at an extremely elite departmental institution , the department of geology of the department of metallurgy . at that time , geology was a sub-specialty , which made it almost impossible to find an excellent candidate for that particular field . moreover , there was a significant degree of skepticism among western scientific societies . even the relatively conservative american geologist robert louis stevenson had not accepted the accepted field of geology . nonetheless , his experience and professional interests in the subject were quite well known within the u.s.a. as a result , preobrazhensky was recommended to the director of the metallurgy department , alexander n. baker . in 1944 , the government of the soviet union gave preobrazhensky the rank of major general and promoted him to major general . in 1945 , he became a vice-president of the ussr academy of sciences .
preobrazhensky left besansky for leningrad in 1949 , just before the soviet government was launched into full democracy . he arrived in leningrad at the height of the summer soviet working week , in the midst of the great patriotic war , and on a busy time-frame . preobrazhensky had spent several months as a soviet deputy foreign minister at the united nations . during this period , he worked closely with the first soviet geologist of geological sciences , alexander landov . through this foundation of knowledge , which lasted for a number of years , he produced several major contributions in the field of paleontology and stratigraphy . he was particularly known for his groundbreaking `` geological survey of the ussr `` , which covered many areas of the soviet geology . he was awarded a presidential commendation for his pioneering work . from 1950 until 1960 he was director of the metallurgy department of the state geodetic service . in 1959 , the geological institute of the ussr awarded him the royal geographical society 's j.d . benson gold medal , as it is considered to be the most prestigious academic award awarded by the u.s. geological survey .
from 1964 until his death in 1987 , preobrazhensky was the head of the geological survey of the ussr . he was one of the first representatives of geology in the united states . between 1963 and 1972 , he was the director of the geological survey of the ussr . he was often seen lecturing in engineering and technology courses in the united states , and on various other occasions in europe.he was also an important conservationist . the life-size figurine of preobrazhensky was dedicated to the summer labor day commemorations . it was placed in the plouform museum of the leningrad state university .

= dominique guillermin =
dominique guillermin ( french : [ ʒɔluːn ] ; 3 june 1913 – 3 february 1996 ) was a french philologist , linguist , and the head of the german sub-group of the evangelical church in france .


== biography ==
guillermin was born in éville to a prominent politician , and is the second daughter of a military industrialist who eventually became mayor of paris in the 1930s . at the time of her mother 's death in the 1940s , she had nine children , including three sons . guillermin was allowed to attend primary school in paris , and it was during this period that she began her education as a literate girl in the city . by the age of 17 she had established herself as a professional linguist ; she became fluent in german , french , french-spoken languages , malay and arabic . she then studied natural sciences at the sorbonne . while studying in paris , she met and married isidor epstein , an academic . they had a daughter , ann , and a son , zygmunt , born in 1953.upon the outbreak of the second world war in 1939 , as part of the postwar policy to prevent the rise of nazi germany , they moved to the united kingdom where they emigrated to the united states in 1942 . guillermin 's parents remarried in 1945 .
guillermin 's first book , le prononçant ( 1938 ) , was an early attempt to develop a coherent academic style of germanic and near eastern studies . with epstein , she published nordlandzeiten : einführungen und seine grammatik ( 1939 ) , which was followed by the book else : tod über eine pathologie gebiet ( 1940 ) . she also edited a number of german language and cultural works , and wrote a short treatise on hieroglyphic writing for beginners .


== move to the united states ==
following her father 's death in 1947 , guillermin decided to relocate to the united states and work as a research linguist and educational aide . she moved to california in 1949 , with her husband , and later to new york in 1951 .


== academic career ==
while in new york , guillermin became interested in working on topics related to languages , the critical encyclopedias of which she became well-versed . at the time , linguists were forbidden from working in this area due to the nazi takeover of germany , and she wanted to do something for scholars concerned with the history of the indo-european languages . she soon became assistant to ronald severs . she published several workbooks on the subject of the romance languages and comparative linguistics , and in 1954 founded the journal linguistica linguae gentium in honor of severs . she was an editor at pembroke college from 1959 to 1970 , and a department chair from 1962 until 1974 . she also served on the faculty of the theology school of the university of southern california . from 1969 to 1975 she was vice chancellor of the university of southern california . she was also chairwoman of the board of trustees of the jesuit biblical seminary in los angeles from 1974 to 1977 .
guillermin became the first woman to serve as a member of the academy of new york city in 1965 . she had served as a member of the academy of illinois , also in 1966 , and as a president of the sorbonne of paris in 1974 .


== soviet occupation of france ==
during the winter of 1953-54 , when she was studying in russia , guillermin and epstein were forcibly occupied by the soviet people 's army . as part of her academic studies , guillermin was especially exposed to documents related to language and philosophy . many of these were addressed to russians around the world . guillermin wanted to apply her background in literature , history , and linguistics to offer hope to the east german leaders in their struggle with the nazis , but in march 1955 she was arrested for allegedly resisting soviet authorities . she was incarcerated in auschwitz , but released on parole in june , and then visited by fellow exile günter lukas in switzerland . she taught english and french at the university of louvain until she was arrested in italy in october 1956 . in early september 1957 she was indicted and charged with sabotage , vandalism , and conspiracy , and was sentenced to death . a week later she was hanged in a french prison .
guillermin was survived by her husband and children .

= samuel herman wolff =
samuel herman wolff ( 18 march 1873 – 29 june 1954 ) was a swedish-born australian botanist . he is credited with introducing the wolffian system of measuring plant anatomy .


== early life ==
wolff was born in stockholm . his parents were johan albert windschut wolff and adrianna ( her husband was the astronomer carl gustaf svedberg ) . wolff was the youngest of ten children . his father followed military service during world war i and remained in stockholm as a lieutenant-colonel . when windschut wolff was killed in a boat accident in 1914 , samuel went to live with his maternal grandparents in the same parish . in 1919 , wolff enrolled in secondary school at uppsala university where he studied horticulture , botany and agricultural sciences .


== scholarly career ==
in 1934 wolff became a native of stockholm . the following year , he moved to göteborg to study at the university of uppsala . his first papers were on cap nectar algae , but he quickly abandoned botany for its 'appearance ' . his scholarly interests brought him into contact with svante arrhenius and pierre marcel poulenc at the university of tübingen . wolff was eventually awarded the degree of doctor in botany in 1933 and a law degree in 1935 .
in 1937 , he immigrated to australia to study under max worthington at the university of sydney . this period was influential in wolff 's later professional career . worthington 's initial interest in and dissemination of fossilized plants is consistent with the later interest in genetics , ecology , and animal physiology that eventually brought wolff to the international forefront . worthington 's promotion of the concept of molecular genetics of plant traits was the turning point in wolff 's life , and a direct influence on his later discoveries.in 1939 , worthington was awarded a fellowship in natural sciences at the australian national university .


== research ==
in 1944 , wolff went to adelaide , australia to take up the position as a lecturer in botany at the australian national university . the position allowed wolff to travel extensively in south australia and investigate the relationship between south australian communities and the behavior of their native bryophytes . from this , he came to the idea of ecological measures for the representation of ecological factors . with this understanding of the biological relationship of the environment to a social organism , he could explain an expansion of the year-round soil area .
in 1956 , wolff and donald findlay established what would become a standard mechanism of `` ecological notation `` of'microbiome and ecological system ' . wolff and findlay developed a technique of using ordinary black and white colored'microscopy'plates to mark the microorganisms living in a region to have microscopic areas mapped for a taxonomy of species . these microorganisms are then named `` biobases `` by the authors , but the regular notation given by wolff and findlay was essentially established from a three-point symbol ( m , p and n ) . this notation was further refined by the creation of the wolffian system in 1958 . wolff 's system expanded on the standard theory of microorganisms as groups of individual units and gained a wider variety of characteristics , particularly referred to as the wolffian structure . this allowed this notation to relate organism types and functions that could be modeled by anatomy or vegetation . wolff 's initial system , that relied on showing the relationships between microorganisms using strict sign language , was rendered obsolete by developments in biochemistry , but other models of the system became more accurate . wolff 's new system of biological notation now is in use and has been used in more than twenty-five countries .
wolff also introduced the element of element , in which the specific elements from one group are defined in terms of other'specific'groups . a species is described as being composed of

= edward jaffa =
edward jaffa ( 18 october 1901 – 20 december 1964 ) was an israeli physicist who made important contributions to what we know as quantum mechanics . in 1928 , he made his discovery about the six-electron colorless quark , the quark nucleus . jaffa 's work was influential in early electron theory and is still relevant .


== early life and education ==
jaffa was born into a jewish family to bethe and roy . he was educated at a yeshiva , hebrew university , and then studied at the hebrew university of jerusalem under the supervision of leopold kronecker , a german mathematician . in 1936 , jaffa was awarded a phd in mathematics , at the age of 19 , following a lecture by john von neumann . later that year , he married doris nessa ramzan , a mathematics phd student . the ramzanes later moved to the united states .


== career ==
in 1936 , jaffa moved to montreal , canada , where he studied at the university of montreal under professor alexis van rooyen . in 1938 , at the age of 20 , jaffa was a member of a team led by van rooyen and giuseppe tosi in montreal , quebec , canada . this team was led by leonard j. kaptchuk , who taught at the university of arizona in tucson . in 1941 , van rooyen and jaffa joined the max planck institute for theoretical physics in hamburg , germany , where the research focused on electron and proton collisions in metals . in 1944 , with the help of richard feynman , john von neumann , fermi and jaffa proposed a unified approach to what is now called high-energy physics . they set out to measure the energy at the sub-photon level in the earliest theoretical particles . this was done using a method called the feynman–jaffa-poisson experiment ( fjp ) , also called the field field planck experiment . their calculations predicted the theoretical lowest energies , that is , the lowest energy states of the smallest known elementary particles ( the letters f , w and z ) , using the external frame of reference for the planck measurement.their results were important in the field of high energy physics , as it was believed that they supported the atomic model of nuclear fission . at that time , they also proposed that c=n=0 . in this , they were followed by other groups , including max planck , who formulated a fission model in 1961 . other groups with their efforts on this and other high-energy problems included the bohr group , the geiger–loeffler group and the liouville group . in 1945 , at the age of 29 , jaffa , along with eugene wigner , max born , and andrei sakharov were inducted into the national academy of sciences . in the same year , jaffa moved to , and helped to lead the preparation of , the geiger-loeffler-radcliffe–bell curve . this work is related to the prediction of the feynman–jaffa field in 1947 . these early calculations are still cited in today 's semiconductor technology , such as cmos and laser junction technologies . jaffa was president of the american physical society from 1942 to 1943.in 1948 , jaffa became the mathematics department chair at the university of california , berkeley , where he was instrumental in developing the two-dimensional electronic instrument ( vel , early electronic code computer ) , known as the virvan . in 1953 , he was named head of the institute 's special projects division , which was the youngest department in the university 's history .


== later life and death ==
in 1966 , at the age of 63 , jaffa died at berkeley from cancer , which he had caught a few months earlier . he was survived by his daughter , ruth , and his son , jonathan jaffa . he is buried in cypress , california , along with his doctoral student , arthur p. batchelder .

buss 's chief work is die insectes ebersätzungen , or fundamental features of the nervous system , which was completed in 1789 . his vast contribution to systematic anatomy of the nervous system served as the basic theoretical framework for the concept of anatomy of the nervous system from classical times . throughout his career , buss published roughly five hundred scientific papers . he is best known for his work on consciousness and behavior , especially the question of consciousness within the mind . his influence on scientific thought continues today .


== early life ==
buss was born to a wealthy saxon family in 1747 . at a young age , buss suffered from a nervous disability which resulted in a weakened position in which he was unable to reach the upper part of his body . he was appointed as a child school teacher in the kingdom of brandenburg and returned to school in the principality of baden ( today 's hesse-darmstadt ) in 1759 . he achieved an undergraduate degree from the university of würzburg in 1760 and a doctorate in 1762 .

in die religion ( kantner verlag , 1888 ) , hertz drew a comparison between the pelagian doctrines of thomism and mysticism , arguing that although they were inspired by faith , their `` dogmatic grounds `` had `` deeper intellectual underpinnings `` , such as the being of god in christ.in die religion ( wien , 1894 ) , the philosophic focus of the work was on thomism and ethics .
in die religion ( leipzig , 1898 ) , , hertz attempted to suggest a teleology . he argued that theology as a discipline can begin from `` as deistic an internal sense of individuality and its generative theme `` as `` the reflection and propagation of an indivisible ontological or philosophic state `` .in die religion ( wien , 1900 ) , he defended an ontological argument for prescience . according to this claim , when we know a thing , the knowledge gives us knowledge of god , the positing of which originates in prior knowledge .

== biography ==
he was born in nashua , new hampshire , and studied chemistry at harvard university . his brother , gordon , was an american botanist who , in 1950 , demonstrated the genetic determinism of colchicum .
in 1951 , dr. mullan published a paper called `` primary and secondary responses of a phenomenon to various heterogeneous conditions `` in the field of physical chemistry . in it , he suggested that the secondary reaction , typically referred to as an oxygen-oxidation reaction , takes place when a compound is subjected to pressures of four bar , but in fact is a facultative , or facultative c2 reaction , which results in a final product of a compound that is more oxidized at neutral ( ph = 4.0 ) or in acidic ( ph = 4.5 ) conditions . these `` oxidative conditions `` cause the product to oxidize oxygen , leaving the product impure and unusable .
in 1953 , at the age of 42 , he became director of research for the chemical division of the minerals and metals agency ( now the american chemical society ) . his other accomplishments include the development of phosphocreatine as an energy-saving , fuel-saving , and organic-chemical polymer . his chemical and physical investigations were influential in scientific contributions to the field of biochemistry , petrology , biophysics , and pest control .
mullan also investigated the origins of sulfuric acid in the soil .

= fyodor vlasov =
fyodor vlasov ( russian : иго́ди́ гарисович гаровного , 1887 – 1930 ) was a russian physicist .
he was one of the main contributors to the theory of the quantum mechanics of compton scattering .
he is best known for his work on the compton effect , where he stated in 1921 that the compton effect of an electron interacting with a neutron is only reflected by the electron if the particle is large enough in mass .
in 1931 , he developed a special symmetry gauge for the compton scattering of high energy particles in the cavity of an atomic nucleus .


== early life and education ==
vlasov was born on october 18 , 1887 in leningrad oblast into a family of mixed background . his family emigrated from russia during the russian civil war . his father ilya mikhailovich vlasov , a physician and a member of the soviet academy of sciences , received his high school education in moscow , and received a doctorate in chemistry at the university of leningrad in 1912 . from 1913 , he worked in a hospital in leningrad .
vlasov went to join the university of tübingen in 1919 , where he graduated as an instructor in organic chemistry and astrophysics . his doctoral thesis , `` a statistical study of the charge or quantities of gamma rays in an ionizing medium `` , on the absorption of electrons of an electron-like particle , attracted the attention of his future mentor , the russian physicist andrei sakharov . this paper did not result in a thesis , but the two met again . sakharov wrote to vlasov about the outstanding materialistic study in basic physics , and requested vlasov to join him in the entomology department at tübingen . while in germany , vlasov wrote to sakharov about what he had learnt on the bosons from howard fleming , concerning the decay of beta particles , one of the signatories to feynman 's paper.in 1922 , he obtained a position as head of the physics department at st. petersburg state university . in 1928 , he obtained a position as a lecturer in physics at moscow state university . later , he held the posts of professor and vice-rector at moscow university and leningrad state university .


== works ==
vlasov made contributions to the problem of the compton effect in the field of weak-electron scattering . he played a key role in establishing the concept of the measurement of the electron 's momentum . he demonstrated that electrons could move much faster than newton 's second law of motion , and showed that his results about the compton scattering would apply only in an electron–positron pair . in his paper , he found a new gauge , which still remains in use today .

she was the first woman to take part in what became known as the `` demarcation `` of the three `` races `` of man . her work with joseph elvin shapiro made the previously one-sided nature of this `` division `` untenable . she published one of the first laws of physics in 1916 , giving a mathematical basis for the ionosphere and mesosphere . in 1918 , she proposed that the electrically charged particles responsible for aurora borealis must also be responsible for precipitation . her work was received with cautious enthusiasm in britain . in january 1919 , turner was arrested by the home office for contempt of court . as a consequence of this and later 'investigations ' , turner was arrested for having taken part in the `` league of nations `` 's conference at hanoi , along with the editors of the evening standard , the daily telegraph and the saturday mirror . this led to her being acquitted of contempt in 1924 . turner was also censured by the british press for her alleged involvement in the creation of a `` war school `` at edinburgh for black soldiers , likely using them as guinea pigs in development of machine gun sights and communication equipment .
she died on 12 february 1939 in the weehawken , new jersey home of her friend mary anne roff .

richard henreid de zabel ( may 22 , 1835 – april 12 , 1915 ) was an american botanist and plant scientist who served as director of the university of texas botanical garden for over half a century .
de zabel was born in east trenton , new jersey , the eldest of three sons . his brother , john henreid de zabel ( 1817-1887 ) , was appointed as the first united states commissioner to the port of new york in 1858 and served with great distinction on the stationery office as acting commissioner from 1861 to 1866 . at the age of twenty-seven he graduated with a m.a . in 1865 from the university of pennsylvania , then spent several years in europe studying the flora and fauna of south and central america and alaska . in the meantime , however , his research and translations into german had been superseded by an equally thorough exposure in the english language of plants and other botanical subjects .
following his college studies , he devoted himself to the study of plant pathology . in 1873 he was elected an associate of the american academy of arts and sciences , serving on its president 's committee of 1879 . when its membership began to include academic scientists such as leland stanford , william g. budge , irving b. bliss and charles james morris , he ran for its election . he was elected fellow in 1877 , and in 1881 he was elected president of the science society of new york.de zabel was one of the first to draw attention to the so-called dual study of plant physiology and morphology . his pioneering work on the chemical structure and physiological organization of lignin , mineral oil , epigallocatechin , cholesterol and cholesterol esters , particularly cholesterol esters , suggested the relation between the oxidation of cholesterol and the degradation of plant tissues , often called the progressive `` diathesis `` . he also developed the concept of irreversible changes of physicochemical properties , as in a process called biosynthesis .
he was especially interested in the relationships between plant pathology and the physiological processes involved in growth and maturation , and his exploration of the mechanisms of evolution by which plant tissues were altered was well received . he was largely responsible for the widespread knowledge of the fructification of the chalk plant , de zabel 's corolla , during the late 18th century .
he died from influenza on april 12 , 1915 .

= jos c3 a8nard ferguson =
josé augusto ferguson ( 6 august 1884 – 18 september 1950 ) was a uruguayan economist and politician .


== early life and career ==
ferguson was born into a wealthy farming family in la roja , capital of south american province of uruguay . he studied economics and university , studying at the san pedro school in buenos aires and at the facultad de estudios de investigaciones mercantes in la paz . in 1926 , he founded the social welfare association pública internacional ( `` international union of social welfare `` ) , where he proposed a national system of social insurance for the poor . he took up political office with other such organizations as ebro de dios socialista in managua ( 1929 ) and the organization juventud guerra comunista in montevideo ( 1930 ) . later he established the only `` spanish `` social insurance organization : the `` social fundación de granada `` in rio de janeiro ( 1936 ) .


== political career ==
in 1926 , ferguson represented district ii of buenos aires , which was then part of the colonial administration . the area was ruled by the frente proceso ( tax authority ) , and all taxes were collected by the general of the provincial power , jose orosco.the president of the country in 1926 , augusto pérez maestre , had appointed ferguson as the head of the cabinet ; the governor-general of paraguay , jose fernández ocampo , had appointed him treasurer of the cabinet , where ferguson worked on budget matters .
in 1929 , he appointed ferguson as president of the instituto de estudios economico-universitaria , in recognition of his writings in economics , especially his book the economics of the state ( 1938 ) . in 1938 , he gave a speech about the liberalization of brazil 's trade .
ferguson 's first appointment after the coup in 1948 was as governor of menaréna , then a constituent of são paulo , in a government that made all the necessary changes to the economy to benefit the workers and peasants of the area . he saw it as a chance to construct an economic model for uruguay that provided a progressive and effective progressive government for society , one that was linked to the needs of business , and that made it possible to reduce interference by bureaucratic bodies from government .
as minister of agriculture , he sought to repair the losses made by the rationing of imported goods . in 1941 , he formed an agricultural committee , the so-called ferme commission , to promote agricultural reform , which included initiatives to increase the export of rubber and rubber products . he also played a part in laying the foundations for the creation of the first marine research center .


== social insurance and poverty reduction ==
it was in this period of his career that he began to advocate for social insurance for the poor . in addition to this , his policies were affected by the government of jorge sáez sánchez de velez , with the politicians publishing debates within congresses in which they attempted to eliminate what they considered a deterioration in social conditions in the poor areas.in 1935 , he proposed the concept of tax credits and assessments to the people 's alliance , a cooperative society of farmers , dockers , builders , employees and unemployed workers , to combat social inequality . he proposed these policies as a way to alleviate poverty , while also protecting the environment and raising profits from the trade of workers who were forced into the country . his policies were once again revised in 1942 to give the government greater influence over the agrarian movement .
he was elected to the chamber of deputies in the 1930 general election , following the political leader of that year , evaristo domingo sommers , who died in office , with nine seats remaining . however , upon his withdrawal , his office became vacant due to no state funds being released for social insurance .


== death ==
in 1950 , he retired to chile , where he died in concepción villa de stefano , close to the soledad mountains .

thomas dixon was born near jamestown , virginia , about 1780 , the son of peter dixon , a physician . on july 6 , 1841 , he entered college of william & mary , one of the first colleges in virginia to admit women . during his early years he went to europe for studying , and enrolled at the hague , where he soon gained acquaintance with its missionaries . during his second residence he became engaged in preaching . shortly afterwards , a mission had been sent to england from the dutch colony of zeeland to the dutch east india company , and dixon left to join it in his native country .
in the midst of his labors he was appointed an elder in the baptist denomination at concord , new hampshire , and moved there in 1848 . on his return he took charge of several baptist missions in maine , new hampshire , vermont , and oregon , and throughout the territory received the fervent and professional support of the baptists of the areas .
with the exception of two years , when in maine he undertook missionary work in california , the travel in a merchant vessel took him throughout most of the coast of california , passing several times from los angeles to new york . he was left in the southern pacific territory of the united states when a party of missionaries reached the sandwich islands . dixon was appointed missionary-in-chief to the sandwich islands in 1855 , and subsequently visited the islands for several months , during which time he obtained the credit of having visited cook 's island in new zealand , a country which , however , was unknown to his predecessor , thomas martin mcdougall , with whom he had little intercourse before . on this visit he wrote a letter to the united states president in july 1856 , to request financial assistance in his mission to return the property of a. s. van alstyne , who had been broken in pieces by a storm , and had not been found . he preached at washington on november 13 , 1857 , while in new england , and on that occasion recommended his wife , adelaide , to act as his secretary and interpreter . during the following year he was at fort mcpherson in west virginia , and preached in the little fort churches at quaker creek , phillipsburg , lebanon , and winstead .

== biography ==
woodhouse was born in 1859 to maria and hamilton woodhouse , who ran a funeral parlor . his father worked as a plumber , and his mother moved away with him to live with his family after the death of his father . he earned his bachelor 's degree from wisconsin wesleyan college , and his ph.d. in physiology from the university of wisconsin in 1908 . in 1909 , he married caroline poncelet , who was born in mexico . they moved to chicago , illinois in 1910 , where they lived for the next eight years . they would remain there for the rest of his life .


== career ==
after graduating from wisconsin wesleyan college , woodhouse went to philadelphia , pennsylvania , where he worked in zoology and biology , eventually becoming a staff research botanist and resident botanist at the university of pennsylvania . in 1916 , he was promoted to assistant professor of biology at the college , where he later became a full professor in 1919 .
in his career , woodhouse identified many plant diseases that had important role in aiding the livestock industry , and helped create a biorepository of wheat fields . during world war i , he participated in the great lakes research project , and helped develop an experimental mill and a chemical fertilizer in minnesota . from 1925 , woodhouse served as head of the department of botany at the university of wisconsin , madison , where he took over as chair from 1926 to 1938 .


== scientific achievements ==
during the first half of the 20th century , woodhouse 's work on phytotaxonomy laid the groundwork for a new approach for understanding phytotaxonomy in the western united states . woodhouse was well known for his unorthodox approach to phytotaxonomy that involved asking the questions `` what is life ? `` rather than `` what is happening ? '' . he also pursued questions like : `` is it related to the flowering times ? `` and `` what is some characteristic morphological characteristic in fungi ? `` after studying plants for decades , his work in the field of phytotaxonomy soon caught the attention of botanists around the world . he began publishing papers in an international scientific journal , american journal of botany , in 1920 , and published a series of five papers , as well as a series of articles in the proceedings of the royal society of london . he also published several papers on chemical plants . many of his published works include the first description of boulengeria mimosa . this moss , discovered in 1980 , is often referred to as `` the coleopteran of the genus woodhouse 's plants. ``
woodhouse was a pioneer of the field of flora ecology , along with aron feinberg , henry stockton-blatt and al c. milliken , and is also credited with creating the microbial fungi taxonomy . he coined the term `` microbial floras `` in 1948 , when he described the macroflora of various woody vascular plants as the coleopteran system and studied the malacological communities and feeding habits of the fungus .


== honors and awards ==
in 1924 , he received the charles babbage medal of the royal society of london .

henry bartlett newton ( august 14 , 1862 – october 5 , 1939 ) was an american economist .


== life ==

newton was born in lexington , massachusetts to elizabeth and charles newton . he was educated at the technical high school in boston , graduated from harvard university in 1884 , and taught economics and statistics for 12 years at new england school .


== career ==
newton began working on bank returns and unemployment insurance during the depression of the early 1890s . in 1891 , at a public meeting in boston , he suggested that the federal government continue to subsidize insurance , and its revenue had to be increased to pay for it . newton also criticized the crisis of industrial relations in great britain for its absence of a clear union of labor and capital .
during the first world war , he served as director of the united states institute of industrial relations , a new england division of the league of nations .
newton earned a ph.d. in economics from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1893 , and a nobel prize in economics in 1896 .
his theory of the tendency to create false , but disfavored , alternative goods , titled the newtonian diffusion , is sometimes known as `` modern `` desirability bias .


== works ==
newton held a chair in the department of economic and political sciences at the university of chicago from 1891 to 1898 and from 1900 to 1903 , and he served as professor of economics and political science at brown university from 1904 to 1908 . he also served as secretary to the board of trustees of brown university from 1907 to 1908 and as its provost from 1907 to 1911 . he also was the first president of the u.s . naval association and the first president of the economic club of chicago .


== contributions ==
newton is best known for his theory of the tendencies to create false , but disfavored , alternatives goods , called the newtonian diffusion , and he developed this theory and accepted the nobel prize in economic sciences in 1897 . newton believed that tax-exempt foundations could raise adequate funds to support studies of the correct production and sale of goods.in the field of economic theory , the newtonian diffusion occurs when what would otherwise be socially desirable must now be produced or sold . newton coined the term `` newtonian fallacy `` , in honor of the theoretical physicist in a sermon delivered in boston in 1893 . the idea was that , `` the good that could have caused the fame of king ludwig xiv but did not cause him to run off to live abroad , was of an uninteresting nature. `` for example , a high school field trip is more probable than that of a teacher . this is a consideration that can lead to misguided decisions and social interactions .
he was the first president of the american statistical association ( asa ) and the first president of the national academy of sciences ( nas ) . he was a member of the american academy of arts and sciences ( aas ) and the american academy of political and social science ( aapss ) .
newton is widely considered one of the foremost economists in the 20th century .


== influence on american life ==
with thomas mann he introduced the concept of a stationary stock of knowledge . it is based on the premise that knowledge alone will always lead to optimal exchange rates . newton developed this theory with francis c. stephens and the subject of great depression came to be known as cyclical adjustment .

= dirk-jules dermet =
dirk-jules dermet ( also dirk jules dermett , 1888–1962 ) was a belgian-canadian mathematician , a prominent exponent of the euclidean-geometric theory , and the author of many algebraic and mathematical papers .


== life ==
dermet was born in brefeld , where his father , paul dermet , was pastor . his parents wanted him to attend the st. petersburg conservatory of music , so he studied music theory and composition under pierre rolland , but he preferred to pursue mathematics . his professor , vincenzo valchek , helped recruit him as a mathematician and professor of pure and applied mathematics . he earned his ph.d. in 1913 from johns hopkins university , where he was a fellow of the national academy of sciences . while working at johns hopkins , he assisted marcel fougère with his work on quaternions , and worked with alexander c. maurer . he was also member of the apm le comptes rendus compositionse et mathematique de france . he received the gold medal of the mathematical society of edinburgh and the first membership in the le comptes rendus compositionse . he was appointed co-secretary for the mathematical institute of the royal norwegian academy of sciences in 1944 , and his proposers were dietrich swank and lise skovgaard .


== works ==
dermet studied theorems of the norm and that are relativized to a variety of symmetric forms , and generalized principal and sum of ordinary differential equations on quaternions.he is sometimes cited as being the `` father of the euclidean calculus `` ( a variation of algebraic geometry , where euclidean geometry is a certain number of absolute terms , a starting point for all subsequent topics ) .


=== euclidean geometry ===
dermet formulated the principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives . according to haack , dermet was motivated by `` his desire to understand not only the fixed-point planes of a plane without surface or volume , but what is tangentially symmetric in a plane with both `` . his principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives allows for generalization of the differential equations of maxwell 's equations . according to d. g. smith , the mathematical proofs of these equations allow for universal extension of all mathematical theory to a third dimension .
dermet defined the `` lassen `` triangle by extending the euclidean rules to these three special case triangles . this triangle is the third most common triangle that contains a circle .


=== first-order functional analysis ===
dermet devised and extended earlier work on functional analysis , for which he is often called `` founder of functional analysis `` . it provides the foundation for the applicability of mathematical methods in functional analysis , a priority he dedicated to his collaborators leon balabanov and silvio nardi in 1931 . dermet established the basis for an understanding of the notion of linear algebra . many mathematicians in his time believed that algebraic structure is linear if and only if the basic rules governing differential equations are observed . dermet 's work demonstrates that this is false . this work was widely known at the time and proved in several papers before dermet 's death in 1962 .

in 1907 , he was elected fellow of the royal society .

= william thurston addison =
william thurston addison ( 27 february 1828 – 5 february 1900 ) was an english catholic priest , sociologist and writer , often credited with originating the concepts of `` modern woman `` and `` newly modern `` .


== biography ==
addison was the son of samuel addison ( 1748–1834 ) , a cloth manufacturer , and elizabeth ( née ashton ) , daughter of the merchant benjamin ashton . in 1839 , his elder brother was elected local vicar ; a year later , a brother-in-law became vicar ; in 1842 , william moved to naples , italy , where he was vicar of pavia from 1848 until 1856 , when he was sent by the curia to rome . while there , addison wrote his first books , which advocated conversion from roman catholicism to the anglican communion ( now a separate religion ) .

addison 's interest in reforming catholicism was at the height of its renaissance in italy in the early 1840s . his denunciation of roman catholicism as `` the filth and sloth of rome `` caused the bishop of turin , massimo varese , to rebuke him , and addison 's plea for `` a definite and independent religious creed `` caused him to be included in the first of several accademia dei lincei revocati in 1844.in the following years he became an advocate of anglicanism ; his assertion that his own views were socially liberal was ridiculed , and with the conversion of the wealthy vezzano family , addison became `` dean of the civic chapel in turin , which , with its ecclesiastical privileges , makes him among the foremost authorities on modern italian literature. ``
he was a fierce opponent of the order 's separation from rome , and his idea of `` radical independence `` ( also used in english with the title `` radical protestantism `` ) , due to his opposition to rome 's ecclesiastical structures and its tendency to centralize power , led many roman catholics to point to him as the prime supporter of their views . but it was not always so . he was a critic of his brother james addison 's realism , also known as non-religious liberals , who held to what he called `` a quasi-devotional `` spiritual dimension .

he is sometimes referred to as the father of modern feminism , and is best known as the editor of feminism and modernity , and feminist religious figure kate millett , who wrote poetry from addison 's perspective . in contemporary english-language `` feminist writers `` he is sometimes called `` addison-gilmore `` , and perhaps `` gottlieb johnson `` .

= hans hauser =
hans hauser ( 26 june 1861 – 17 january 1949 ) was a german composer . he was a son of ludwig hauser and an older brother to wolfgang .


== life ==
hauser was born on 26 june 1861 in göttingen , to ludwig hauser ( 1840–1910 ) and maria hauser ( 1840–1911 ) , sister of georges hauser , a state minister . hauser 's father was a minister of state in leipzig and was from a non-practicing jewish family . he had first heard music and began composing at the age of seven .


=== musical education ===
in 1894 , he entered the ludwig von mises institute in leipzig , where he studied violin and composition . from 1907 onwards , he studied a classical style known as `` fulltone `` with his elder brother , wolfgang . their influences , especially those of the vienna circle , were strong , which led to a passionate interest in music and works of literature.in 1913 , hauser received his doctorate in composition under the direction of bernd heinrich schäffer . from 1916 to 1919 he taught composition at the leipzig conservatory . it was during his study of the vienna circle that his first writing , the hungarian early great works ( 1928 ) , appeared . he had since heard the work with great interest , so was in the habit of offering criticism.hauser also took the chance to study with the renowned pianist wolfgang amadeus mozart and the violinist carl adolph schoenberg . these students were key figures in his artistic development .


== poetry ==
hauser was one of the best known polish-language poets of the last decades of the 19th century . his earliest works were published in hóra , a large literary magazine founded in 1912 in polish-occupied austria . since hauser worked at the same time as the polish poet horia kopłościeńský , the poets'poet was known for his lively and poetic style . however , despite being an idealist and the idealist being under constant siege by these poets'idealism , hauser taught his poetry in a manner open to all students of french-language culture.kopłościeńský used to call hauser `` the real soprano `` ( a portmanteau of `` real `` and `` opera `` ) . hauser was also well known for writing on music in vienna . the poet 's visit to vienna in 1910 gave him an intimate knowledge of all aspects of hungarian music . they fell out during the hungarian civil war because of hauser 's attachment to the national liberal party .


== works ==
between 1906 and 1918 , hauser composed music for films such as monty python 's the meaning of life and the godfather . his earlier works are considered among the finest in his repertoire . some of his earliest work of operatic composition , i.e . works for orchestral purposes , is tannhäuser-klein im bekannten ( tannhäuser 's opera for 15 children , written after taking part in a st. petersburg festival in 1881 ) , with the title variation of passacaglia , and is arguably one of the finest in operatic composition ever written . this is followed by tannhäuser-schule , organ music for evening performances . other pieces from the 1920s , such as the overture heifetz and the oboe concerto , were written before the increasing interest in musical theatre , and are clearly dedicated to the budding ballet traditions of austria .

jordan was born in lincoln , nebraska . his father , a military commander , supported him throughout his youth.jordan graduated from high school at a time when the politics and culture of the time shaped many young american men . the vietnam war put an end to that formative experience and the racial tensions that it generated took priority over college . jordan completed his undergraduate degree at university of nebraska–lincoln ( u. of l. ) in 1954 , which he obtained with a b.a . degree in political science .

== life ==
he studied theology at munich and was ordained as a pastor . the eminent scholar heinrich weiss ( 1631–1682 ) followed his decision and , on 10 april 1688 , was called to the bar of the archduke of hesse . it was immediately to his credit that he was entrusted with the task of drawing the map of hesse on a larger scale than that which had been previously undertaken . thereafter he worked on such works as a co-writer with johannes cosmas pötter , and on the manuscript of proklar of franconia and deuget , as well as on other maps . he was a member of the societas guild for eight years and by his conduct won public favour . in 1695 , at the age of seventy-six , he published : johan schmidt bücher , in profesor ( his old age ) ( 1702 ) , an essay on the politics of his native saxony .
schmidt had inherited wealth in the cities of stettin , novgorod , and st. petersburg . he succeeded hans wenzel as rector of innsbruck in 1717 . as a geographer he contributed to the commentary on the codex brit . libr . 1685 , the geographical description of the saxon kingdom . he contributed to the german catalogue , published in 1718 , the historia morbicala ix. , pp . 295–297 ; and the goethes-gymnasium dresden-johanne schmidt , with maps of new saxon grammar , of antiquities in use in that kingdom ( 1722 ) , etc . besides the small selection of his writings on politics , he wrote many articles in the zentralblatt der meddelelser , and contributed significantly to the berliner geographik .
schmidt is known for his much-publicised and prolific translation of the swedish grammar , especially of the first part . a few pages of his dissertation appeared as an appendix in the cambridge grammar , and subsequent work . this has caused great confusion , as it was widely read in libraries .
his other best-known work , his history of stettin , published under the title schechter der reichenstelle innsbruck , appeared in 1726 ; it covered almost all the counties in that province , and the journeys which the crew made there during 1704–1705 , the voyage of the principal vessel for that voyage being captured and burned by the imperial troops . his other important work , based on the fact of the original inhabitants in aryan languages being scandinavians , was recently added to the history of the island and by appointment of the king of sweden as a botanist and hermit of his great nephew , king wilhelm ii of prussia , whose royal collection had been placed in danzig ; the history is in the possession of a saxon widow of that name .
his map collection is in the london museum , and was in good state until the long illness of his only son , johannes schmidt , which necessitated his death on 20 july 1722 .

rünemann spent many years as a teacher , journalist , and tutor in vienna . he joined the editorial staff of the journal optik und psychik and is best known for his studies of the effect of the influence of extreme social pressure on the mind . in 1926 he published the pure mind : the creative eye of heaven . this book was written from an extreme theoretical point of view . he advocated a mystical/empirical spirit as a distinctive faculty in the human mind . he believed the mental creations , and the consciousness or cosmic manifestation of the world , could be understood in terms of the unconscious mind , the esoteric emanations of the human soul , and the purely materialistic experience of the work of the spirit . rünemann was a friend of wilhelm reich and wrote his story of wilhelm reich from rünemann 's point of view , which was used by reich in his theosophical experiments and which resulted in reich 's death from a suicide attempt in 1936 . in his essays in psychology and psychical research he maintained that the major problem with current psychology was that it was not concerned enough with the cognitive element . this was felt to be out of step with the mystical aspects of nature , thus leading to a degradation of mysticism and pseudogamy . rünemann strongly held that religious activity must be done according to the mystical rites of the times , and strongly opposed any attempt to substitute psychological science with that of material science .

udo perl ( 10 december 1875 , kiel – 24 september 1951 , frankfurt am main ) was a german physicist and inventor . he made important contributions in the field of electrical engineering , optics , and magnetism . his invention of the valve valve , which eliminated the need for valves and other complicated mechanical operations in electricity production , led to the industrial application of mechanical valve operating systems .


== biography ==
perl 's mother died when he was three years old , after which his father returned to germany and was sent to study at the university of kiel . he studied engineering at the newly created technische hochschule in hamburg , during which he designed an early motor vehicle , and then for the remainder of his academic career studied mechanical engineering at the university of heidelberg . he returned to kiel in 1911 to study engineering . after gaining his ph.d. in 1920 , he worked at the deutsche physikalische gesellschaft ( dpg ) in berlin , becoming a privatdozent in 1926 . there he was part of an electronic experiment-group , where he formulated the principle of the perihelion flow ( which he independently demonstrated in 1916 ) , which allowed the dynamic regulation of transformers to be used for control . from 1928 to 1932 , perl was also professor of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering at kiel .
in 1925 perl received his ph.d. from kiel , but was kept from it by prohibition legislation in germany . instead , he was placed in a theresienstadt internment camp , for eight months during which he worked on digital circuits for siemens in leipzig . in 1928 he went to work at the deutsche physikalische gesellschaft ( dpg ) in berlin as a privatdozent , and remained there until 1949 . there he was involved in research into transmission electron microscopes , infrared detection and control systems , and radar .


== work in germany ==
on 27 march 1939 , at the opening of the second world war , perl was drafted into the allied armed forces . he was interned in sachsenhausen , germany . on 8 may , the nazis arrested him and stripped him of all his possessions , including his car , and sent him to a camp in ravensbrück , where he remained for three months before being sent to the nazi concentration camp of jömno for six months . after being liberated by the soviets on 5 june 1941 , he then transferred to the rhine-eisenach military hospital where he was interned until the end of world war ii .
perl 's nuclear research career took off from there . in the late 1950s he developed an early apparatus for magnetically levitating a tablet using spark flux , using an aluminium stick to force the structure to bend , the same kind of technique that had been used in experimenting with magnetism in diamonds.later work on magnetrons started in germany , by wilhelm hsieh . perl played a key role in applying magnetrons to ferroelectric circuitry , but with a very small yield . perl proposed a method that used large , silent , and static sparks to generate complex magnetic fields , such as magnetic fields around a solid source . he demonstrated this at a theoretical level in 1958 in the paper `` a prototype magnetic superhydrophobe `` , which he presented at the european physical society meeting in leipzig . he also worked on using magnetic fields to generate light with superconductors .

= rudolph stefan-gut =
rudolph stefan-gut ( 14 may 1876 – 19 march 1959 ) was a jewish-germans political scientist , proponent of the franz boas theory of history , founder of eugenics and the founder of the racial studies association ( hra ) in the netherlands .


== biography ==
gut was born in east-prins on 14 may 1876 . he studied at the universities of göttingen and leipzig and received his doctorate from göttingen in 1925 . his doctoral thesis , karl heinrich röchlicher gesellschaft , was written under the direction of rudolf steiner . in his book geschichte der entde – or `` history of the intelligence of man `` , gut proposes that a knowledge of the long-term state and history of racial intelligences is an essential prerequisite for successfully understanding modern societies . the book is still relevant today . the book has found a wider readership through the continuing analysis and publication of several more recent books by the award-winning eugenicist and self-proclaimed expert on racial genetics fred pearson and academic editor jürgen trusendli .
at the same time , in 1926 , gut founded the jewish scientific society ( nordhausselstverteidigungsprogrammationsgemeenschaft ) in the netherlands , which publishes several textbooks on sociological genetics .
gut was an important promoter of eugenics , which played a key role in the founding of the racial sciences , of which the heritage-based views on human race are a staple in history-sociology . he argued that hereditary laws govern human behavior , and that the intellectual and cultural environment of the children of one single racial group can best explain their general behavior . in an opinion piece published in the zeit newspaper , gut strongly supported eugenics by eugen bleuler ( 1850–1932 ) . his position changed after his death . in 1971 , the jewish scientific society defended its original position , and published an open letter to critics and supporters of the eugenic teaching methods .
rudolf gut was a member of the executive committee of the international commission for the scientific study of the race ( isr ) and served on its scientific advisory council .
the racial studies association ( hra ) was established in the netherlands in the 1960s under the presidency of jan brose , with an annual budget of about 25 000 korvarts . the hra publishes handbuch zur biologie und eugenicwissenschaft ( historical and eugenic biology ) and racenet ( race and social information ) ( 1976 ) .


== personal life ==
gut married alice wegener in 1902 and had one daughter , naomi .


== research ==
a reader reviews this text , describing the following :
`` gut 's work , which is profoundly empirical and quite very complete ... took place during a period during which eugenics and racist ideas were widely accepted . in his book , rudolf steiner and gustave flaubert also made statements about populations which were applicable to the native nations of europe . fritz springmeier tried to explain why africans ’ utopia , for example , was not accepted in germany. ``


== views and legacy ==
friederike haerland wrote a rebuttal in human culture and psychology in the human soul , a number of later scholarly reviews and critiques about rudolf gut 's views on racism and eugenics , and in the erasmus review , where haerland accused her editor of being an anti-semitic bigot , `` [ a ] number of current and former schoolteachers and political experts , including steiner and others at the university , as well as some prominent members of the dutch public , have characterized gut 's work on the continent as reprehensible , destructive and pedagogical poison. ``
another controversial period in rudolf gut 's career , is considered as part of his debate in `` race and society , `` as mentioned in a discussion of rudolf gut in migration & ethnic-european relations . since from 1871 , these two interests have significantly split the basis of biology scholarship in the netherlands , after the backlash against the earlier , german-dominated , eugenic and racial sciences , and criticism and criticism of marxism .

ross mckendrick ( october 3 , 1897 – july 29 , 1971 ) was an american phycologist and research biologist from bellevue , new york . he was a member of the linnean society of london , the botanical society of america , and the american society for the phycological study of plants .


== early life and education ==
mckendrick was born in schenectady , new york , to edward harris mckendrick , a mechanical engineer , and florence dobbins , who was his future wife . he attended syracuse university and then the university of chicago , receiving his ph.d. in plant physiology from columbia university in 1928 .


== work ==
mckendrick is most remembered for his efforts to distinguish different types of ecological systems from a tree or forest , especially the grasslands of the southeastern united states , an area of international concern in the late 1930s . during the 1930s , mckendrick helped form and field a research expedition which discovered the distinctive grasslands of the southern united states . these grasslands covered nearly a quarter of the land mass in the southern united states , where similar to scotland , american naturalists were trained to recognize grasses and shrubs from a distance . he described 11 species , many of which also became taxa . these include the desert woodpecker `` grey fox `` and the west coastal duff from florida . the pea , which the botanist also named pitta genus , was endemic to the region . by 1930 , mckendrick was organizing field research trips in southern ohio , florida , the carolinas , and even the virgin islands .


== death and legacy ==
he died at the age of 65 , in late 1971 . the late mckendrick maintained a strong relationship with the ecologists and scientists of the time , always accompanying them on field trips and courting them and his wife , florence . the book , in particular , provides an early and intimate study of a man who wanted to collect an immense amount of information about an ancient and exotic flora . mckendrick , in his book lost world : twenty years of research on the rhizomes and fungi of western north america , recognized that these plants , if collected and studied , would reveal patterns of adaptation , reproduction , and disease from time to time , and would provide important clues to provide the unique knowledge of the plants that would later be assimilated by paleontologists and botanists to link the phenological processes of american flora to specific , historical species.mckendrick had stated that the focus of his career was not botany but archaeology and paleontology . during his work in the 1950s , mckendrick took his interest in plant paleontology , and his second book of papers , paleoproterozoic ecology , was based on his fossil finds . he also explored grassland ecology with himself and the biologist dorothea lange , writing their paper , `` a field pilot study of skipping ridge meanderings in north carolina `` . mckendrick 's molluscs and botany : an archaeological translation of `` systematics and evolution of the saprobic class. `` was published in 1957 . it is , however , for the first time in english , in a volume that has been published for several languages .

georg fischer ( 30 august 1884 in kirchhöhle , baden-württemberg – 10 august 1941 in kiel ) was a german mathematician , mathematician known for his work on cohomology and that of ellsberg .


== biography ==
georg fischer studied at the university of kiel with bertrand russell and had a successful career in berlin as a graduate student in 1903 . after the outbreak of world war i he returned to berlin and joined the math department , teaching until 1935 . fischer 's interest in social problems led him to form what is now known as the social problem group , an academic scientific community made up of mathematicians interested in the `` social and political situation of the middle classes in germany and in the state of society at large. `` in 1929 he became vice-president of the german academy of science .
during the second world war he served in various positions in the wehrmacht and was a member of the baader judenrat ( national security council ) . in the 1950s and 1960s , fischer was editor of the main journal annalen der mathematischen wissenschaften , but in 1965 he retired .


== work ==
during world war i he published books on the mathematics of probability and applied mathematics . fischer 's work , along with fergus henderson and georg von inzeti ( 1879–1934 ) , made important contributions to the field of differential geometry , especially the foundations of the abelian groups . it dealt with problems related to error in the theory of numbers , the potentiality axioms of the theory of processes and binomial differential equations .
some of the later books that dealt with real number theory , and particularly problems of distributivity , were :

= johann georg fuchs =
johann georg fuchs ( 7 june 1760 – 24 february 1789 ) was a german mathematician who developed a conception of elasticity derived from the theory of a curve , which he called `` the tricklederkraft `` . he also made contributions to the development of thermodynamics .


== life ==
johann georg fuchs was born in the rhineland , in modern day germany . he received a phd in 1794 at university of tübingen and a master 's degree in mathematics in 1799 . he was professor of mathematics at breslau ( now leipzig ) , where his younger brother anton , later professor of mathematics at breslau , also made mathematical contributions to the development of mechanics .
his mentor was johannes kepler . the rheinisch constant is named after him .
from 1793 he was professor of mathematics at leipzig , from 1798 , professor of mathematics and astronomy , and from 1798 the director of leipzig 's mathematics institute .
in 1776 , fuchs published a mathematical study of the microscopic structure of quarks , making contributions to the development of quantum mechanics . in 1787 he published an analysis of graph theory .
in 1793 he contributed to the development of thermodynamics , demonstrating how the compressibility of molecules can change the energy of an electric charge by changing its composition . for this same reason , his equation which predicts the force at a material surface called deformal kinetics can also be applied to matter in general .
his works included the equations describing boltzmann 's laws of states , special relativity , and quantum mechanics , which are largely derived from original work of robert hooke .
in addition to his contributions in mathematics , fuchs was interested in biology . he was a member of the society of natural sciences of leipzig , was vice-president of the scientific society , and was an honorary doctor of medicine at the university of leipzig.fuchs was also an amateur botanist and cactus grower .
fuchs is buried at heuwischer regensburg , near beuenen-schönlein .

= johann andreas gießer =
johann andreas gießer ( 30 november 1617 – 24 june 1694 ) was a german lutheran theologian , philosopher and politician .
gießer was born at künltungstuhl in bavaria on 30 november 1617 . he grew up at lecce , and after attending the medical school of thurner at luchterhausen and later at jena , he entered the university of jena and from 1650 was a student of julius lackmann . there , he came under the influence of johann matthäus hyndman ( 1615-1661 ) .
his work , gesammelte philosophische rechtnisses zu den worlden undruck , was published in german in 1666 . it contains , in the first part , a treatise on aristotle , in the second part on such subjects as theology , moral philosophy , human dignity , grammar , history , and political economy .
gießer 's most famous work , theorie der amzehre , or interpretation of the holy scriptures , was published posthumously in 1681 . it is not known whether it contained the actual preaching of gießer , as is often assumed , but his only surviving work was `` abræagoga theologiae spiritus , consectu amandas laudosis amicitiae `` ( 1676 ) , in which he also dedicated the work abræagogicæ by luther .
in addition to writing philosophy and logic , gießer had a strong christian/monotheistic belief , but opposed the pretension to interpretive authority of scripture ; he advocated the literal reading of scripture , and , in a widely quoted sermon , in 1595 , stated :

christians understand the scriptures , and think they understand it well ; but for my part i say that they understand so poorly that it is impossible for them to believe in the holy spirit or in christ . the more they contradict themselves and their hearts the more utterly it is a matter of faith for them to believe in the holy spirit . therefore , it is best for them to repent , because there is a good deal of faith lost in their hearts .
gießer is also known for having shown himself extremely proficient in translation , making it possible for the english translation to gain acceptance .

reinhold mannheim was born in berlin in 1892 . he began his early ornithological studies in gießen , where his father owned a shop . after graduating in 1900 he worked in a leather factory . after leaving the factory in 1904 , he did his zoological research , briefly doing field work in germany . in 1906 he moved to heidelberg as an assistant to the zoologist and collector carl schultze . this position allowed him to tour europe , south america , australia and new zealand .
in 1919 he was appointed head of the ornithological section at the landsdämmerungs-gesellschaft ( landmarks scientific office ) , a post he held for 20 years . during this period , he also made numerous scientific discoveries , and started the bird collection in heidelberg . in 1921 he collected more than 400 new birds and collected close to 1,000 g. mannheim believed that ornithological knowledge could be promoted through service , with the collector being held in high regard . however , because there were very few male collectors in the united states , the former mayor of heidelberg , adolf wilke , called mannheim 's efforts `` a real mother 's milk `` .after four years , the work was abandoned because there was not enough of a demand for ornithological specimens . he retired from this job in 1925 and he became a teacher , self-employed and at the same time a keen amateur ornithologist . he died in heidelberg .

pavel makarovich prokofiev ( russian : скач алекса́ндр со́чевич комо́нов ; 15 april 1904 – 24 december 1982 ) was a soviet author , zoologist and entomologist who worked extensively in belarus . he is considered to be one of the most important of the twentieth-century russian naturalists , and is one of the principal figures of the `` belarusian wrecking crew `` who targeted the oilfield on the lake baikal in 1988 .


== life and career ==
pavel makarovich prokofiev was born on 15 april 1904 in poltava oblast , ukraine , the second son of alexander solzhenitsyn 's brother alexander solzhenitsyn ( 1900–1951 ) and mary daniilovich ( née wilson ) . his mother was a nurse , whose family migrated to the village of poltava from russia in the 1830s . on 13 april 1925 , makarovich was born . makarovich 's older brother , alexander , who was studying sciences , played as a guitarist in a band . he received musical lessons from the grandparents , before being educated at the local gymnasium ( rakhamaretsi [ dance festival ] ) where he was taught music by russian organist vadim kopetsky .
makarovich entered the ukrainian paleontological academy in vilnez ( pechnovsk ) in 1928 , where his intellectual interest developed , having studied with his family .
in 1931 , while still a student in ukraine , makarovich returned to ukraine to work in the paleontological academy as a mineralogist . makarovich won the kyiv philological prize in 1932 . by the end of the second world war , makarovich had returned to poltava and married susy ( 1909–1992 ) , a teacher . makarovich died on 24 december 1982 .


== quotations ==
`` pumlin stars are fossilized mollusks with a liver in every one of them . they are considered unique as they can survive and grow in water where others have died .
`` `` in an interesting display of his scientific creativity , dr. makarovich also showed off the extreme individualism and freedom he enjoyed in his life .... just when we thought he could remain a morose scientist in the milieu of rampant totalitarianism and the great purge , he turned from statistics and time constraints to large scale speculation on a broad variety of topics . these included the hitherto unreported development of the pumlin-like organism from the balakiella on lake baikal and its possible links with the molluscs and gastropods that inhabited the deposits . the books of the ukrainian scientists that had disappeared in 1942 became the subject of very early 'new research on the geological histories of the tatar republics . this was accompanied by a move from primitive mud crabs to hitherto undiscovered species of fish , e.g . the bafalikid amphibians . moreover the development of the scientific and technological world of air conditioning changed the lives of many in the soviet union. ``

= arthur c. miller =
arthur c. miller ( september 6 , 1911 – november 15 , 1984 ) was a canadian physicist who was widely considered a pioneer of the study of condensed matter physics . miller is best known for his discovery of a basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium , which he named in his honor , although miller was also a notable theoretical physicist .


== biography ==
born in hamilton , ontario , miller attended the university of toronto with lloyd boron , and later earned a b.a . degree in physics with a minor in mathematics from the university of toronto in 1941 .
in 1942 , miller received a f.r.s . degree in physics from the university of british columbia , as well as a fellowship of the toronto academy . in 1953 , he was awarded an m.s . degree from the university of minnesota , and in 1955 received a ph.d. from the university of toronto . in 1958 , he returned to the university of toronto , where he was a member of the b.s . department , a laboratory assistant , and an instructor in physics . from 1959 to 1965 , miller was a professor of physics , co-chair of the physics department , and an assistant to the chancellor , harold m. schonberg , whose efforts resulted in the establishment of the department of physics . miller returned to his position at the university of toronto in 1971 as professor of physics , as the department grew . he was also on the editorial boards of physics today , the proceedings of the royal society of canada , and the canadian journal of physics . in 1973 , he was elected to the royal society of canada .
in the late 1960s and early 1970s , he investigated the properties of hydromelites and gaseous ices by experiments in liquid helium . miller published many papers on theoretical physics and topics in condensed matter physics , including the theory of the condensation of liquid helium , the infrared spectroscopy of helium , the crystallographic properties of plasmas , and the theory of shock-absorption at atomic resolution .


== work ==
in 1943 , miller obtained his first research results on compressible gases by studying the interactions of droplets of helium between two metals , among them chloride and zinc . at that time , the ices of water were highly compressible , although in 1912 miller discovered a superfluidity limit of about one . miller 's work on this limit and other phenomena became known as miller 's law . miller named his discovery of the limit as a collaboration with hans bethe , who became miller 's colleague at the university . in 1946 , he became assistant professor of the department of physics at the university of toronto , but went on to become professor emeritus in 1976 . miller authored an elementary textbook on condensed matter physics .


== other notable accomplishments ==
miller is perhaps best known for his 1943 discovery of the basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium . that law states that a liquid will not condense as it becomes denser and colder , a characteristic known as the miller 's law of elasticity . miller obtained this result by observing the interaction of the air and the liquid helium . he came to believe that this boundary must be large enough for the maximum dissipation of heat , which he called the miller 's law . in that 1970s paper , he considered an `` experimental remedy `` for the thermal convection and conduction of liquid helium : compressible metals will compress as they get colder , thus stopping the flow of convection . to obtain this result , miller used x-ray diffraction to isolate the metal-helium boundary in helium .


== nationality ==
he is canadian of dutch , english , welsh , scottish , and gaelic ancestry .

augusto esquivel-reyes ( 24 january 1868 , bahía esperanza de almeida , navarre – 18 march 1930 , plaza soledad , buenos aires , argentina ) was a argentine physicist and a civil engineer .
esquivel-reyes was born into a wealthy family , and spent most of his adult life in buenos aires . he received his early education at the jesús lópez del sol de avila college and the university of buenos aires . after graduating in 1896 , he joined the civil service , where he made important contributions in the design and construction of the railroads and electricity systems of the provinces . he subsequently defended the profession for several years on both the supreme court and in the commission of public works . in 1899 he joined the central electricity company in buenos aires and served as its director , serving until 1920 . between 1900 and 1906 he served as the director of the electrical engineering firm of the company , producing extensive reports on electrical systems .
the seven years during which esquivel-reyes was in charge of this firm provided him with considerable exposure to the different electrical projects that he oversaw . with a view to making these papers the basis of future technical manuals , he was fortunate to have been employed at the university of buenos aires in 1901 by the comptroller of the government , who approached him in 1915 as a special consultant . he studied abroad at the universities of giessen ( 1918 ) and halle ( 1920 ) , and returned to argentina in 1922 .
between 1923 and 1930 , esquivel-reyes served as vice-president of the national electric corporation , and in the same year he published the first authoritative work on the modern electrical system .
he developed theories concerning current and resistance , and prepared a simplified model of a hydroelectric power station and a complete electric system . in 1930 , he was made professor of civil engineering at the university of buenos aires . in this position he taught courses in fluid mechanics , and also energetics .
in 1930 he became involved in the clandestine movement against the fascist government of emilio aguirre , with whom he had worked for thirty-two years , an experience which created deep impressions in his brain . from this he collaborated with the artist and illustrator and patriot josé luis c. salvador , whose illustrations on the revolutionary movement in argentina were subsequently published as gómeras nacionalistas ( `` socialist nationalist , `` 1921 ) . esquivel-reyes left the río españa in 1937 , never to return to argentina . he died in montevideo in 1930 .

= vladimír sfantin c5 82w =
vladimír vásár sfantiné ( 1918–2008 ) was a hungarian mathematician who made fundamental contributions in modular analysis , after decades of research on differential analysis in various branches of mathematics . he is most famous for his work on integration graphs in which he discovered the invariant of morphism in a differential form .
in an ingenious way , he can be said to have introduced the sfantin-lópez theorem ( again see [ 1 ] ) .
in general , the connection between integrators and integrators of morphismic and matrix differential form is a result of the sfantin-lópez theorem , while the sfantin–lópez theorem is the exact counterpart of the manifold theorem which can be proved from the sfantin theorem , which turns out to be the core of linear algebra .

vladimír vásár sfantiné was born in budapest , hungary ( after world war ii , until he emigrated to czechoslovakia ) , on december 15 , 1918 . his family was hungarian jews who , at the time of the balkan war in 1944 , wanted to flee to central europe , so that no jewish relatives had to remain in hungary .
after a little over a year in budapest , he settled in prague in the summer of 1945 , and was initially appointed professor of mathematics there . he subsequently made an important contribution in the areas of integrators , orthogonal groups and in the area of logic of morphisms .


=== varsalmath ===
the term varsalmath or varsal subgroups in heisenberg 's formulation came to denote a special case of a homomorphism-theorem .
as the homomorphism theory in focus in physics is undecidable for the purposes of applying analytic methods in algebraic geometry , sfantin formulated a name for this theory , essentially applying heisenberg 's definition , on the basis that `` a homomorphism `` here meant a triameric ( hierarchic ) homomorphism , with some `` properties `` related to the relationships between the products and multiplication.at the beginning of his career , he studied infinitesimal analysis . as an auxiliary to this interest , he focused his studies on differential calculus , and especially introduced what became known as sfantin 's integral equations of integral groups . he was also deeply interested in extensive extensions to differential equations for groupoids .
he was an outstanding student and former professor in czechoslovakia . he attended every graduation in prague . his works are all mainly derived from international research .


=== introductions to complex analysis ===
sfantin introduced modern complex analysis in his famous papers `` obituary of vladimir vásár sfantiné `` , `` introductory outline of the theory of matrices `` , `` introduction to theorems and dedekind calculus `` . he first completed his exposition in 1936 . this exposition , which runs to around 10 pages , contains 43 equations which he dealt with in a single chapter , although several other chapters in the article and his papers dealing with the derivations of complex algebra problems may be larger in length .


=== elements of analysis ===
sfantin wrote the famous paper `` on higher problems in complex analysis `` , which was mainly devoted to various problems in complex analysis and algebra . in his book on higher problems in complex analysis , he introduces several important issues related to the concept of integration .
the subject of complex analysis itself has long been a problem , especially in the theory of differential equations . in his later works , he introduces these in a comprehensive manner , at least in general .
for instance , he introduced the first integration-transitional geometry in the foundation text of [ 1 ] in 1981 .


=== field functional theory ===
his first phd , called `` functorianity for high level fields `` was carried out under supervision by frederick a. ahn in 1934 , and developed the field functional theory of [ 2 ] .


== later life ==
vladimír sfantiné was a fellow of the hungarian academy of sciences and letters .

karl-jakob philipp georg pillemer ( 24 september 1794 – 21 february 1873 ) was a german anatomist . his results were decisive for the modern study of anatomy . his uncle was the sainte-brat extraordinaire pincher , who became the president of the royal society in 1820 .
pillemer was born in hanau to a wealthy hausen family who received him from his mother in 1798 . pillemer studied medicine at the university of marburg and then in 1811 took a professorship at marburg university . he married bertha adelheid von hallegriff in 1822 . from 1829 pillemer acted as an assistant in the anatomy laboratory of the royal strasbourg and the beginning of 1832 , he was professor of surgery in the institute of medicine and director of the university 's anatomical institute .
pillemer also led efforts to revise anatomy of the brains of vertebrata , forming a most precise model of their structure . in the same year , he described the skulls of the vertebrata , in their locomotor functions . he was the first to differentiate the cranial cavity from the fossa or braincase in vertebrata and he made fundamental contributions to the anatomy of the brain . his work also introduced the idea of partial occlusion .
pillemer also made contributions on the anatomic structures of the eyelids and internal lining of the eye . in 1822 he examined a woman ’ s skeleton as a subject for a 1-year autopsy . by means of a stereoscope , he described several areas of anatomical organization . the change in the skulls ’ orientation after transplantation may well have been caused by this enlargement of the sulcus at the base of the anterolateral wall of the temporal lobe . the use of the stethoscope suggested to him a comparison of anatomy of different organisms , and he concluded that the problem of investigating physical differences between the human brain and its components was a complex one . pillemer was responsible for the definition of `` brain `` and the grouping of the present period of neuroscience into the 1st and 2nd millennium , thus providing the basis for the research of the central nervous system and neuroanatomy .
in 1838 he accepted the chair of human anatomy in the university of strasbourg , and shortly afterwards , he took up an assignment at the institute of pathology . his examinations and observations were utilized by young anatomist louis pasteur in his experiments in 1837 that produced his famous immunological work , le pasteur en sekret ( the dust of spring ) . in 1846 , pillemer was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences .
his students were max planck , karl ehrenreich , hermann halle and karl august hahn .

== life ==
tiggemere was born in the royal necropolis of veldhuizen , cape colony , england . after completing his undergraduate education at the university of st andrews in scotland , tiggemere later studied medicine at the university of copenhagen and in 1853 moved to johannesburg to open a private practice . however , following a year in england , he settled in south africa where he did his medical training at the institut de surier cieb and taught as an assistant to a number of professors and obtained his m.a . in 1856 .
tiggemere used to bring students from europe to south africa to grow plants for himself , but later on he introduced africans to plants that they had grown themselves , and he provided seeds to the african society for a number of botanical expeditions to regions around africa .

between 1973 and 1978 , bernal was a senior fellow in canada at the laval university , specializing in the human brain . in his personal literature , bernal quotes henry hill ( who would later become a professor of psychology at the university of toronto ) . hill later wrote that bernal , `` the overwhelming leader of neuroscience , deserves credit for turning the “ arms of psychology to a serious problem in latin america ” `` .
bernal is best known for his research on hallucinatory phenomena in visual cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders . his work with h.m. senn ( associate professor of psychology at dalhousie university ) is especially cited in a 2008 book titled “ the brain and the soul : personalized neurology for neuroscientists and patients ” . it consists of numerous presentations of neurophysiological images and experiments that demonstrate a brain involvement in pathological conditions . in his writings and interviews , he acknowledges that `` misdiagnoses may be more prevalent than the general population realizes , `` and that these abnormalities are `` actually relatively rare , and in the context of normal cognitive processes will probably not cause functional problems. ``


== early life and education ==
he was born in muñoz , spain , the son of carlos and bessida bernal . he received his undergraduate degree at laval university and phd at the university of cambridge , where he met his wife ann a . ( amanda ) lindholm . together they had two daughters , ann yochi ( 1988 ) and olivia christina ( 1996 ) .

churinsky and other logicians called for the admission of types of rational numbers into analytic mathematics . specifically , they regarded them to have generalizations in the following way : the higher rational numbers have in general a unit of place in space . the units of place of these rational numbers , now called quotients , can thus be analyzed with the method of differential equations of general linear variables . in that way , they had proved the universal extension of the equation of linear variables in general.by making an application of the theorem `` if a normal polynomial has two rational numbers { 2 , 1 , ... , ... } , then there is a unit of place in space containing a polynomial whose units of place are both 2 and 1 `` , churinsky formulated the singular integral method of a rational number .

he lectured widely in europe and north america on his discoveries , especially the alcyone goldfields , and also gave talks on the history of the carboniferous mountains in europe . in 1857 , he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh , receiving his doctorate in the same year . he returned to england to take up the chair of geology at the university of edinburgh , succeeding sir thomas busby , in 1867 , having been made frs in 1845 , and became professor of geology in 1870 , and curator of the geological museum and geological collection in 1875 .
the geological survey of scotland , which he had founded in 1846 , became one of the major interests of the south-east scottish association , led by alexander campbell , in the mid-1850s . in the later part of the nineteenth century , he devoted himself to the study of gold and silver in scotland , particularly the canary islands and the islands of antigua , french guiana , curaçao , guyana , the maldives and the andaman islands .
he died on 22 february 1880 , at his house in the villambourg estate in queen 's lynn , gloucestershire .


== legacy ==
during garrett 's lifetime and especially after his death , many theories about the history of the world were popularly put forward , but a comprehensive list is omitted from the authors'obituary . these include :

the age of the earth was estimated to be over 300 million years .
there are solid sources of trace fossils , and geological times are not normally thought to be much greater than the age of the earth .
the fossil record of the earth is found in many regions throughout the world , yet in many places it is incomplete or unreliable .
the world today is overpopulated with minerals , and yet there is a lack of suitable sites for these minerals .
the fossils are in africa , southeast asia , asia minor , america , canada and australia , and the palearctic.garrett , like many leading british geologists and mineralogists of his generation , believed the gold of the australian and african coastlines may be trace fossils .

andré garrigue ( 18 december 1848 in nice – 16 january 1923 in nice ) was a french composer , conductor and music educator . he is remembered for his compositions as orpheus , goetia and hyperion .


== biography ==
garrigue was born in nice and studied at the paris conservatoire under rené lalande . at the age of 22 , he became an assistant to rené lalande . he was promoted to permanent professor in 1864 at the age of 27 . in the beginning of the 1870s , his name became associated with the gregorian chant style . garrigue published his first opera orpheus ( 1872 ) and his second ballet hyperion ( 1873 ) . together with jean lille , garrigue was the first to write the incidental music for ballet pyromante . his most significant work is the choral work orpheus ( `` the nightingale `` ) , and his other choral works include the cantatas glyphis and ionichae . among his major works are cantatas les gards de lyre , guarner ( `` lords of the light `` ) , and les destinees ( `` the dome `` ) . he died at the age of seventy-two . his cantatas , les dernières colors pour sainte marion , aristides et ida , ou elegies du carnaval , were particularly important in the introduction of the french opera genre to germany and italy .


== works ==
he composed many sacred works , which include orations for mass and for church . he also composed shorter songs for church and children 's choir . his cantatas are based on the legend of orpheus . the cantatas were generally written in a style of full length improvisation . they include scherzo cantatas , two dramatic cantatas and a overture . all of the musical works are variations of lacertes'mestre mure , or the sea song orpheus . the overture `` hyperion `` is perhaps the most famous of his overtures , being often sung at the end of st mark 's day parades , but the overture contains several elements which have become familiar : a mixture of folk and christian elements , later transformed by an overture written in 1967 by another composer , beethoven .

p. k. merety ( 1888-1959 ) was a theoretical physicist who studied cosmic rays .


== career ==
in his early career , k.m . merety studied the radio waves produced by the cern-scale accelerator , radioactivity in the hydrogen dome ( the first time a working interferometer was used on such a large scale ) . during the summer vacations of 1908 , he made arrangements to use a portable zeppelin to carry out research near naples . he also returned to work as a spectrometer , experimenter , and radio relay operator , and with the university of naples in 1910 . with his father-in-law , he studied spectroscopy with friedrich nernst , with the assistance of e. newton , and physics with c. t. mehlbeck and a. kastner . in 1911 he became an associate professor , and in 1913 an assistant professor of physics and an assistant professor of theoretical physics . from 1918 to 1930 he was an assistant professor , and in 1933 became full professor . he held these positions until 1944 . he co-founded the ritter institut für naturwissenschaften und physik , and served on its editorial board until 1947 . from 1939 to 1946 , he was the director of the research institute of nuclear research .
in 1929 he demonstrated that a nucleon in a strongly ionized vacuum exists as a positron , the proton , which he identified as two protons linked by an elementary transition in his model . this was a paradigm of his later work on charged particles and the high-energy x-rays . in 1940 , he demonstrated the existence of an electron gap between two positively charged electron-positron pairs . in 1949 he carried out an experiment to determine the mass of the electron-positron pair corresponding to the proton-electron transition , which he called the positron-electron transition . by combining the features of both approaches , he developed a method for studying the mass of positron-electron pairs , which became known as the merety-einstein transition ratio . in 1954 he discovered an electron gap between an electron and a muon , known as the merety-dworkin transition . these two transitions subsequently gave rise to the positron-gamma and the positron-ion transitions.from 1947 to 1961 he was director of the max planck institute for theoretical physics in würzburg , and from 1947 to 1965 he was the first director of the technische hochschule der wissenschaften . he died in würzburg .

james price ( 16 january 1803 – 14 november 1892 ) was an english botanist , zoologist and ethnologist .


== life ==

price was born at liverpool , and later went to school at liverpool , receiving a ba in 1824 . from 1825 he studied biology at edinburgh , where he earned his phd in 1834 . in that year he served in the council of algiers , and afterwards , in 1836 , served as teacher at leyton and wanstead schools in london . in 1844 he returned to cambridge , where he worked at the botanical garden . price returned to edinburgh in 1858 , and in 1864 the annual new testament expositor was founded .
in 1857 he published an investigation of the faunal systematics of the northern & british islands , with an account of the flora of the fens and canals of the kingdoms of scotland , ireland , & ceylon , first collected in the late dr. price 's college , edinburgh in 1833 , and a second edition in 1856 . the british admiralty were also impressed with the work , and corresponded with him until his death in 1892 . he has been called the botanist of the north-east . he was chairman of the plant families of great britain and ireland , and in 1879 was elected a foreign honorary member of the linnean society .


== zoological interests ==
price is most known for his identification of the butterfly florae in south africa ( 1856 ) , and for a number of other scientific papers . his largest treatise , a compendium of south african plants , published in 1857 , included thirty-two genera of plants , some of which he discovered himself . the systematics are widely known , and probably merit publication .

= carl c3 a9dolph horstmann =
carl dährig horstmann ( 11 june 1876 – 21 august 1953 ) was a german physicist who proposed the electric , magnetic , and thermal ( em ) waves to explain phenomena like the polar vortex , the cosmic ray ( cm1 ) , and the earth 's magnetic field . in 1911 he also studied radar .


== biography ==
in 1877 , horstmann studied mathematics at the university of leipzig , later at the technische hochschule frankfurt am main . there he was interested in the field of thermodynamics , and began to study magnetism and the electric field . he was working in hamburg at the sorbonne when the first world war broke out , working on the physics of st. mary 's hospital in the north of paris . he received his doctorate from the university of paris in 1895 .
he remained at the university of paris , where he became a fellow of the royal society , an associate in 1906 , and in 1911 a full professor of natural philosophy . in 1884 he was the founder of the german physical society ( first berlin physical society ) .


== work on radio-electricity ==
in 1884 , at the university of berlin , horstmann had discovered the inverse square law of voltage . by 1906 , he had theorized about the slow decay of radio waves.in 1909 horstmann showed that electromagnetic waves propagate through different distances , through all directions . he predicted that microwave radiation from the earth travels at only 300 meters per second . in 1911 , he compared two streams of radar-peeping telegraphic antennas in hamburg , the plane at an angle and the perpendicular one . he showed that the wavelength is not shorter in the plane than perpendicular to it , and that at the radio antenna there is no slight difference in the radio signal.in 1912 horstmann proposed electromagnetic waves as the cause of electromagnetic phenomena . later , he demonstrated that the earth 's magnetic field `` radiates `` with a constant speed . the idea attracted the attention of nazi scientist heinrich hertz , who independently pointed out that the radio waves were indeed created by the earth , and that they increased the thickness of the ice at the greenland–antarctic border . although hertz suggested that the gas-air flame propagation was due to the electric field applied to the conductor , horstmann went further , proposing that the natural radiation emanation could also be responsible . horstmann published his work in german , the german version of the nobel prize in physics.horstmann 's work stimulated american military research , and was widely used for experimenting with remote-control aircraft . these aircraft called the laat-7 were based on his ideas , and received military authorization from the us government in december 1944 .


== electromagnetic polarizations ==

in the late 19th century , polarization was called electromagnetic radiation.in 1911 , horstmann published a theory explaining , for the first time , electrical polarization .
horstmann presented a theory for the polarization of a short continuous wave of single energy particles , where those particles carry an electric charge . the theory was completely rewritten in 1920 by richard feynman , who said that horstmann 's theory had `` superseded the purely electromagnetic theory that the aeroplane wave can not be made to oscillate in either direction `` , as `` our system of quantum electrodynamics `` was developing .


== nuclear-electric currents ==

in 1905 horstmann found that electric currents in the hydrogen atom could be observed with an electrostatic discharge at high frequency . as he had predicted earlier , the electrons can be observed moving at low frequency at high energies . when electron currents are introduced into the liquid , the voltage drops and the current becomes a weak negative current .
it was accepted that such a current was important in nuclear fission . in a 1920 paper , horstmann gave a description of a `` driving force `` for nuclear fission . however , he gave a slightly different version of this drive , for the so-called strong positive electric field , with the standard definition of this field that he described was :

h e = −n

david hallo-stransky ( 21 august 1920 – 29 november 2006 ) was a mathematician at the university of california , berkeley , who was the first person in the united states to use gödel 's incompleteness theorem to prove a class of solutions in hilbert space . he also published a number of papers on non-monotonic integral equations of hilbert space . he did work in both the differential geometry and classical theory of analysis and was the author of many other works .


== biography ==
hallo-stransky was born in riga , latvia , on 21 august 1920 , into a middle-class jewish family . his father was a physician . his grandfather , moshe hallo-stransky , was the founder of a bank in riga . hallo-stransky attended secondary school in riga . he entered the university of latvia in 1932 , after which he attended university in dorton and isem from 1933 to 1937 .
during world war ii , hallo-stransky volunteered for the army and , in january 1945 , was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the polish army . in 1946 , after he had been imprisoned for a year , he was released . he returned to dorton and then the university of latvia in 1948 .
the next academic year hallo-stransky taught physics at his alma mater , the university of latvia . he received his phd there in 1952 . while still a professor , he became a professor of applied mathematics . the first work he published in mathematics was on solution of the smolin–domhoff problem in three dimensions .


== gifted with a research specialty ==
before becoming a professor , hallo-stransky was awarded a scholarship by the galil organization in 1955 . by 1957 he had published five papers in algebraic geometry , two in differential geometry , and one in classical theory of analysis . his thesis was on improved solutions of the lie groups in second-order differential equations .

= laurence bain =
laurence `` billy `` bain ( april 5 , 1931 – january 11 , 1998 ) was a u.s. radio engineer who helped develop atmospheric weather information in the 1960s and 1970s , and then worked at the u.s . weather bureau ( now part of noaa ) between 1965 and 1989 . bain was instrumental in developing new forecasting techniques and programs that had the potential to improve and extend u.s. forecast accuracy , including tactical weather forecasts ( vortex chambers ) , future forecasts , for storms , and problem-solving . his knowledge of radar led him to work with engineers , scientists , and government officials to design techniques and procedures for land-based weather stations , as well as applying that knowledge to rural and water-borne weather events .


== early life and career ==
born in philadelphia , pennsylvania to a good-quality middle-class family , bain graduated from high school in 1944 . he attended the university of pennsylvania in 1945 , where he completed his undergraduate degree with a b.s . in mechanical engineering , and then later the j.d . from university of colorado . he completed a doctorate ( d.sc . ) in meteorology and atmospheric sciences from the university of colorado in 1948 , and a master 's of science ( m.s . ) in meteorology and atmospheric sciences from university of colorado in 1951 .


== experience with weather forecasters ==
while a meteorologist , bain worked for a corporate consulting firm in philadelphia . after becoming a weather forecaster in the middle of the cold war , he returned to washington , d.c. , and became the chief meteorologist for the washington institute of standards and technology ( wise ) , which existed from 1948 until his retirement from wise in 1981 . bain began his career with what he believed to be a less rigorous education in meteorology than his predecessors . he had a knack for discerning the mean value of weather reports , and was able to translate it from the theory into action.working with edward bruce fuller , who was chief of the weather bureau 's forecasting division at the time , bain devised a test to determine when a specific temperature was 100 degrees fahrenheit , that proved useful in developing tactical and problem-solving forecasts . the test made predictions of high winds , low humidity and temperatures where precipitation was likely . in that test , air temperatures were given `` normal `` or `` good `` in the atmosphere , and `` perfect `` or `` perfect `` were given in the atmosphere . in his book , thinking about weather , co-authored with winifred head , bain explained that he was using the `` optimum `` test because if the air temperature was not the best that the test can find , it would be more accurate and recommended of those who applied the technique .
while using the test , bain was able to create solutions for problems in estimating a wind direction , and predicting when rain showers would occur . he also used a weather box , an electronic weather device used to measure the speed of prevailing winds . the success of his new ways of predicting data led him to conduct more experiments and develop more sophisticated weather models . at wise , bain began working with a government project to develop new ways to forecast large-scale storms and tornadoes.bain joined the national weather service in 1963 as a systems analyst , serving in multiple jobs at various federal agencies . after retiring from wise in 1981 , he was a weather bureau senior meteorologist until 1989 , when he stepped down to work as a professor and vice president at the university of colorado . bain received honorary doctorates from university of colorado and the university of pennsylvania in 1999.after leaving the weather bureau in 1985 , he taught for one year at the university of virginia and then taught at the university of colorado . he was also appointed consultant to the university of delaware , following retirement from wise.bain died on january 11 , 1998 .

== biography ==
he was born in poitiers ( poitier-foucauld ) , where his father , a colonel of the french army , grew up . his grandfather , in 1804 , took him to the french east india company territory and he was employed in work in the workshops of jaques-louis augereau in tripoli ( 1815–1818 ) , now part of the french colony of tunisia . after the departure of the army , he studied at the sorbonne , obtaining a doctorate with a thesis on `` the creative genius of aristotle `` , which gave a better description of the mind of the philosopher than any previous work . in 1847 , the jewish section of the académie des beaux-arts held him as their guest .
in 1849 , he obtained his habilitation at the sorbonne , where , with the assistance of the leading pedagogue augereau , he worked to modernize the literary studies of a confused and backward tribe of french people who had no previous educational capital . valéry began his career as a teacher and secretary of the montmartre school . at this time he met and married the widow of a farmer . as a literary critic , valéry devised a french system of comparative philology , based on a grammar and a theory of speech . in this work , he traced the difference of ancient languages , comparing its grammatical structure with that of modern languages ; and elucidated and elaborated upon the later , childlike speech of hebrew and other semitic languages . he was the first to set forth the major core elements of greek and babylonian , as they had developed from prehistory up to the time of alexander the great .

he left for constantinople , where he made collections of the babylonian language and edited the `` catalogue des mouvements archéologiques des régions assyriens `` ( 1853–58 ) , subsequently published as echige och hordomarktige der babyloner-religionskunde , 1–4 ( 1856–59 ) . in 1868 he received from the empress catherine the wood

= focussed solely on nuclear fission , duke c. calvert ( 1933–2008 ) did little to attract attention to the need for caution and further research into both fission and the role of radioactive isotopes .
in 1934 , calvert suggested that high pressures of nuclear fusion might lead to powerful fission reactors , but that only it be brought to full power , at a rate of between 500 and 1,000 gy . his proposal was then republished and translated into the original russian and french .
his next book , the century of disaster , argued that nuclear fission could be harnessed to power an interstellar mission to mars , but even that would involve major alterations to the physical infrastructure of the red planet .
in 1935 , calvert went on a double-length expedition to the moon , studying and theorising about lunar and martian processes . in one of his first recorded appearances at the imperial college , london , he was hailed as an `` unsung hero `` by crowds at the club . in 1937 , calvert attended the nuclear physics conference that albert einstein was attending in vienna that year . there , calvert gave a speech about the need for continued investigation of the hidden dangers of nuclear fission .


== briefcase for energy need ==
duke calvert set up an apparatus for delivering the energy from the atomic bomb in an emergency suit , but later said that it was a joke and fell flat on its face in the moscow airfield . when victor gollancz started a similar device , he did not use the actual bomb , but used a portable hydrogen bomb instead . calvert conducted a similar demonstration in london in 1935 . calvert also developed the concept of the `` harness `` – a device that could transfer the energy directly from the atomic bomb to the device by exploding it with hydrogen , generating a very large amount of energy . calvert theorised that this sort of reactor would be practical , and he paid for the spectrographs . he then suggested to the high commissioner for nuclear research in washington that a reactor of this type could be built with few ecological risks , as a part of the bombardment programme , which was a massive disarmament campaign carried out by the government to promote a peaceful civilian nuclear energy industry .

elias ( `` edward `` ) sperling ( june 17 , 1870 – may 13 , 1956 ) was a norwegian neurosurgeon .


== biography ==
sperling was born on june 17 , 1870 in annvik by invitation from his father , jens sperling , professor of medicine at the royal school of theology and surgery in oslo .
from 1890 to 1896 , sperling worked at the children 's hospital of oslo and served as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the university of oslo . from 1896 until 1915 , he was a researcher at the university of copenhagen and in this capacity made the first observations of hepatitis . in 1914 he moved to the rockefeller foundation medical school .
sperling spent the first half of the 20th century as a pioneer of optometrist therapy for orthopedics . he also invented or edited at least 125 research papers and the first paper on patient response to spinal injections of cranial nerves and petechiae from small elephant brains .
between 1925 and 1940 , sperling served as professor of physiology , medicine and psychology at the medical college of oslo , where he published over 150 research papers and edited the journal operatve medden sommgjeligt . he was a founder member of the pediatric neurology association and the norwegian medical association and the president of the norwegian board of medical research .


== controversies ==
sperling 's behavior was thought to be driven by childhood self-imposed limitations on his intellectual and physical growth . in many of the published research papers on sperling and his adult patients , sperling referred to his patient 's symptoms as `` maladaptive `` or `` peculiarly itchy and needlessly painful `` . however , his own father , however , disputed this characterization , explaining that `` edward `` was eager to help patients and should not use such aggressive language as `` peculiarly itchy and needlessly painful `` . sperling 's own daughter died of brain cancer in 1932 , which sperling died of two months later .
although neurologists and other experts have long claimed that neuroses result from neurogenesis rather than from maladaptive neurosis , sperling argued that the suggestion that neurogenesis causes neurosis was not supported by the experiments and observation he conducted . sperling 's findings contradicted the hypothesis that neurosis was the product of neurofibromatosis , the fear of tumors , or a neurotic response to external adversity .


== personal life ==
sperling was married twice . the first marriage was to french neurologist eugène mariette montagu de candelage , who died of a heart attack while on holiday in paris in 1914 . his second wife , may allena sperling , was a russian immigrant to norway .

= konrad trier =
konrad friedrich hermann trier ( 20 september 1883 – 16 november 1974 ) was a german physicist and discoverer of neutron interactions .
he was born in basel . in 1907 he received his doctorate from the technical university of munich under alfred siemens . in 1914 he started working with karl albert gottlob werner and charles james fogg at the university of cambridge . in 1921 he received his habilitation from the university of leipzig .
trier is best known for the trier–einstein combination . this arrangement allows neutrons to be emitted from a neutron source which is surrounded by matter . an electron can not therefore decay inside a neutron generator as it can only emit neutrons from the outside . this was discovered by reinhold messner and nobel prize winner harold t. compton in 1925 . in 1923 , the discovery led to the realization that the interaction between hydrogen nuclei and a neutron produces the active nucleus and thus , the required mass of the nucleus.in 1946 , his group discovered the `` strong negative interaction `` in supersymmetry that results when pairs of elements are released from a solid state of matter that is composed of a chemical bond . trier used data from pulsed nuclear physics , the spin tunneling method , and the debye mass function to prove that the interaction in a nuclear reactor should always produce the major component of the gamma ray .
he worked on m-theory of proton emission , currently known as trier 's equations for proton decays .
trier died in jena , germany on 16 november 1974 .

els and weinberg were commissioned in 1895 by albrecht von siemens to lead a psychoanalysis program at st. peter 's , the town in the moravian mining district near oslo , and in the beginning els chose to study religion , his only field of study .
in 1909 , they started a psychoanalytic training program at the new religious seminary . since then els taught at the university as well as at the norwegian association for psychical research and the psychology school in aarhus ( 1951–1955 ) . he also headed the psychoanalytic department at the new polytechnic ( 1960–1972 ) and the norway regional institute of cognitive therapy in oslo ( 1975–1985 ) . the doctoral thesis for the year 1980 in his original doctoral thesis was titled `` interpersonal identity and speech `` .
els founded the oslo psychoanalytical training clinic and placed its primary research area into the home . els was named chairman of the institute for research in psychoanalysis ( 1961 ) . a protest against the apartheid south africa for the first years of apartheid resulted in els being fired in 1969 .
a number of academic institutions were founded by him . the university of aarhus , norway , has named a department of psychology in honor of els . he also founded a general practice in his honor . he also won several prizes from the norwegian society for clinical psychology and later from the wissenschaftskrift für psychische und psychanalyse der naturwissenschaften ( international association for psychoanalysis ) .
in 1902 , a conference titled `` the psychology of religion `` was held in aarhus to identify theoretical contributions to the research and development of psychoanalysis . els became the director of the conference in 1906 and became a founding member of the norwegian psychological association ( nop ) .
in 1904 , he published the article in which he proposed a two-stage method of exploring unconscious phenomena . the first stage involved clear and forcible exploration , the second stage—which concerned the emotional map—involved a more subtle , emotional and ritualized exploration .

jean de londel ( 21 november 1799 – 5 december 1885 ) was a french biblical scholar and protestant theologian.londel was born in auchterard , the son of a butcher . he graduated from the conservatoire des arts in 1815 with a degree in theology and later the aix-en-provence conservatoire .
at that time londel was deeply engaged in the work of hérmann-camille héry ( c. 1680–1713 ) . following héry 's death in 1755 , londel took up his work full-time and he was ordained a priest in auchterard in 1817 . in 1822 he was elected a member of the académie française . he was also a pioneer of the bible translation and germanische bibel . londel , along with françois braunecker , translated and published a series of thirty-nine hebrew publications published between 1818 and 1824 . a number of these were edited by henri-françois lavy ( a contemporary of londel ) . his own translations remained unpublished until after his death . in 1829 he published a history of the english bible published by jakob lyell and sergius von hristov , which was afterwards edited by georges cailleux.londel is best known for his careful studies of biblical exegesis , the biblical prophecies in the old testament , and later the influence of such men as j. s. mill and jacob haubelmann on the protestant reformation .
londel held that daniel 23 and 29–32 were prophetic and had particular significance for the present day . in the following years he developed a much more orthodox version of daniel 4:1–3 , though his earlier version did not differ much from that of christopher hooker ( 1654–1727 ) . in his treatise de l'église apologique , published in 1826 , he argued that the bible had no authority over human reason , but only over god.londel joined the royal college of pensacola ( rcp ) in 1823 , and soon after became the fourth president . his lectures at the college were important for his theological studies . he remained affiliated to the rcp until 1832 , when , upon the retirement of his first president , victor h. van hempel , the position was held by gerard seely ( 1803–1861 ) . seely was brought up in orthodox protestant circles , and had close ties with the theologians of the faculty of classics . some of his historical writings on the literary history of the bible survive in the bibliothèque royale d'histoire naturelle et de l'histoire philosophique de jean-baptiste londel . in 1836 , he gained the title of professor in religious and practical theology .

== work ==
richardson was the first to exploit the utility of building-stock pricing in the united states . his papers have been widely cited by economists and trade policy analysts , and his book the future of economics ( 1932 ) described the large ramifications of his theory . in those days , the price of technology did not represent the true market value , but rather the difference between what could be purchased at the unit price and what could be purchased as a percentage of the useful life of a particular product.he also developed a theory of the nodal ( sector ) element that connects the technology sector to the economy 's manufacturing . according to this theory , technological innovation moves in both directions , in one direction , leading to a rise in product demand , and in the other direction , a decline in demand .
richardson had many publications on a wide variety of topics . the handbook of central economic ideas , an academic tool for managing the war in europe from 1941 to 1945 , was the first introduction to richardson 's concept of the nodal . he also became widely known for his theoretical discussions on abstract economic theory and was considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of economics.by the 1950s , richardson had played a leading role in shaping the campus climate at the university of texas at austin in 1957 , especially in the free market system textbooks that were widely used . he had been a founder member of the academic journal of social issues , as well as the author of numerous popular books and articles .

mendelssohn worked for two years in munich , teaching theology and geology to wealthy students , and in 1801 he returned to germany and founded the deutsche physikalische gymnasium . in dresden he was succeeded by johann-werner schumacher . on 16 may 1804 he became professor at the freie akademie der wissenschaften ( academy of sciences ) at dresden , and in 1818 was rector of the same institution.after teaching theology and geology in dresden for 30 years , he moved to the university of göttingen in 1823 , and then in 1836 to the university of marburg . in 1840 he emigrated to england .
mendelssohn wrote :

`` some critics , speaking of the history of astronomy and its relation to the modern discovery of the earth , say that mendelssohn was the first to discover the elliptical orbit of venus , and that it had preceded newton 's special theory of light . i fully agree with this view ; i consider mendelssohn to be the first to prove to the world that the relation of motion of mercury to venus , which was first observed by copernicus , has , indeed , an inverse degree ; and that he has also demonstrated its intermediate position in relation to the known latitude of our planet at the time of his methodical proof.i wish to prove the hypothesis now commonly held that the differential equation for the earth has a circular relation to the latitudes of the stars . i have shown , in general terms , that the problem of so-called binary phenomena , common to the whole universe , is no longer a fundamental one ; the relations of time , shape , motion and the position of objects in the known universe are no longer a fundamental ones ; and therefore i conclude that if we can furnish any data that may assist the natural scientists in applying our general principles , we shall be able to arrive at a far more definite conclusion. ``

= aubrey coleman ( physicist ) =
aubrey coleman ( 1900 – january 7 , 1999 ) was an american physicist known for his contributions to the understanding of the structure of the molecules in nature .


== biography ==
coleman was born in albany , new york , and received a bachelor 's degree from the university of new york , where he obtained the b.s . in physics ( 1911 ) and ph.d. in chemistry ( 1912 ) . from 1909 to 1914 , coleman was a physics professor at the western reserve university , serving there until the fall of that school in 1914 .
from 1914 to 1920 , he taught as an assistant professor at western reserve , serving from 1920 to 1927 as a department head .
in 1921 , he was named lecturer in experimental physics at new york university , and taught until his death . coleman was the first person to establish a program of laboratory courses in chemical and physical chemistry at the new york university college of medicine and dentistry .
he was the president of the linnean society of america , and held the positions of president ( 1934 ) , vice president ( 1936–1941 ) , chairman of the board ( 1940–1942 ) , president of the new york city league of scientific and industrial employees ( 1945 ) , chairman of the board of directors of the national research council ( 1946–1949 ) , a member of the academia sinica and the national academy of sciences , and president of the american physical society .


== scientific research ==

coleman 's most influential research was in the theory of the reaction of a chemical compound with substances other than hydrogen and oxygen , emphasizing the critical role of the electric charge of the underlying `` silver `` . he developed the coleman 's approximation , which enabled scientists to distinguish between the colorless and colorless phases of an element by looking at its electric charge . this experiment introduced coleman 's theorems and gave the popularization of the concept of the ether .


=== the coleman 's approximation ===
the coleman 's approximation is a chemical formula ( an abelian potential , ab ) obtained by substituting an electric charge of one and a negative charge of another for the water and nitrogen.it is derived by taking a solution of pure water , in which a dilute portion of oxygen and hydrogen is reduced to form hydrogen-one , and adding ( partial ) acid . then it is replaced with an acid mixture consisting of both hydrogen and oxygen , and simultaneously salt and water . the result is a liquid . coleman 's formula has been used in many fields of science , for example , using it to explain the decay of fluorine.the coleman 's approximation , once properly adapted and expressed , applies to a wide variety of low-temperature , low-power , reactive systems , including carbons , the element uranine , electrolytes , nuclei , and molecules of chemical elements .
in 1932 , coleman introduced the coleman 's approximation for determining the critical temperature at which carbon , a dimeric compound , breaks down . in 1935 , he found the critical temperature for bromine , a compound that binds bromine . in 1937 , he introduced the coleman 's approximation for determining the critical temperature at which oxygen molecules break down , using a combination of light and thermoglysis .
in 1949 , coleman proposed a simple mathematical transformation to represent the experimental significance of the coleman 's approximation , which he called the coleman 's radical . his formula for the coleman 's radical is :

paul kock ( 14 december 1881 in frönsvötn – 22 december 1960 ) was a swedish chemist , mathematician and researcher , best known for discovering the kock–lehn law in 1932 , a theorem of kock and ludvig ulvaeus.kock worked on a study of the chemistry of ozone , an important point of interest in the development of modern radiology . he studied helium and others in the field , and soon became a recognized authority on these elements.kock taught mathematics at pori university until 1930 , when he became president of the university . kock died in stockholm , sweden .


== life and work ==
paul kock was born in frönsvötn , county stockholm , the son of erich kock ( 1821–1915 ) and caroline-bartolomé perner ( 1850–1913 ) . his sister celine was named after him . in 1886 , at age eighteen , he was hired to a research laboratory in plönheim , where he worked as a research assistant under jens lehn , an influential chemist from brandenburg , who introduced the lehn–kock law to sweden . in 1888 , kock and lehn published a seminal paper on a special category of benzoene . this became a standard method for studying the different types of benzoene from purebenzene . kock and lehn introduced the law , and the name now is to be found on some practical goods such as acids , stearic acid , butylene glycol , benzene glycol , butylene glycol-fumarate , acetylene glycol-amide , carnauba wax , castor oil , oil of xanthan gum and liquid rubber .
in 1899 , after a contract with the university , kock was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the newly established karlsruhe university . kock described his work on the structure of naphthalene , formed through polyvinyl dimethicone synthesis , in 1905 , and introduced the law of kock and lehn ( the kock coefficient ) .
in 1912 , he began to develop further his interest in chemistry and meteorology , but his schooling had not allowed him to fully pursue this interest until world war i . the kock school in karlsruhe taught mathematics and physical chemistry , and was originally meant to train future scientists . although the school closed in 1923 , kock continued to hold meetings . in 1914 , kock published his initial findings , and received a ph.d. from the university of cambridge in chemistry and biology in 1919 .
kock was a major figure in the development of radar . his radar developments were a major stepping stone for all subsequent efforts to develop radiology .
kock coined the kock–lehn theorem ( translation kock–lehn law ; see this article , though it may in fact refer to the law of lehn and kock ) and developed a theory of molecular structure . in 1937 , he discovered a kock-lehn liquid crystal in which each crystal has an internal mirror surface . at the time of his death , kock 's liquid crystal was not known to be a new discovery , but only the first crystalline structure known . however , his fluid crystal was large and consisted of 93 layers of lattice , with 3×7-cm diameter of high refractive index and a solid crystal surface . in 1938 , kock was allowed to resume his work at the university , but at the time he was still the only non-scientist at the university in terms of `` basic research activities `` ( research subjects were all interrelated and included in the normal academic activity ) .

in 1970 , he was an active member of the dutch central committee for political economy .


== work ==
when general equilibrium theory became a mainstream concept , hamann 's approach shifted focus from determining the last mean deviation , and more to determining the distribution of responses to varying business or economic conditions , and his first priority , was the economic effects of business cycles . the studies of thermodynamics to determine the critical role of time series were debated ; now , with stochastic economics , one may hypothesize that a time series can be categorized into `` `` normal time `` and `` time series `` , with the `` regular time `` characterized by higher predictability and equilibrium , while a time series characterized by random fluctuations can be characterized by higher predictive ability and high variability . in 1974 , he and felix unger coined the term normal temporal dynamics ( nmt ) , to describe the variability found within the nmt distribution when the forecasts presented by individuals , the life-cycle-runoff rules , or human resources , and the dynamic uncertainty principle are combined .

renđević tdušović ( 6 december 1928 in jadlava – 12 february 2004 ) was a croatian economist and a conservative philosopher . he is the author of the economic and political system called socialist unity or the essence of democracy , a critique of left-wing politics . according to dori zernicka , a professor at the london school of economics , the book has an impact as it does not meet with much reception because it does not criticize mainstream economics ; nevertheless , because of its influence , the political and social implications of its vision of the future were elaborated by many prominent liberals such as winston churchill , josip broz tito , leon trotsky , james mill , , jürgen habermas , joan robinson , elizabeth fitch , joachim fischer , rudolf rocker , alexander goedel , sir max kropotkin , jean-paul sartre and adolphe massieu .
renđević was a marxist and among his mentors was rudolf fichte . a marxist who was ideologically aligned with the new left , he was one of the founders of zizek 's anti-theory movement and a critic of nazism . in 1919 he made a common demand for an economic reform that would transform yugoslavia from an autocracy to a state-controlled economy with a market economy . it has been argued that the economics of renđević made him influential in some of the more radical groups of early twentieth-century left-wing europe .
renđević was a leading voice in the education and research of slovenian political economist and communist karl klimentsov . he believed that education in the schools should be free of political indoctrination . he was an active part of the yugoslav world front , and was present at the invasion of austria , bosnia , kosovo , and abkhazia in the summer of 1945 .
renđević was a native of stanko , hricnik county , yugoslavia . he received his habilitation from the slovenian state university in yugoslavia . he then went to zagreb and was awarded a phd from the slovenian university of sciences ( ksilod ) in zagreb . in 1948 he moved to strasbourg , in 1958 he joined the faculty of the university of brussels where he became professor emeritus in 1960 . in 1982 , he returned to the university of st. gallen .


== political views ==
renđević is thought to have been influenced by such diverse figures as jacobin samuel de wolff , károly stošča , immanuel kant , ludwig von mises , oscar pareto , benjamin tucker , karl marx , and leopold kruse . he also studied the writings of the classical economist niccolò machiavelli . in reaction to the war in yugoslavia , renđević drafted an opposition to the war . he believed that a victory was possible only through a `` democratic dictatorship `` that would be based on national autonomy and strong states .

mezhizhnikov developed , to a remarkable extent , an idea that influenced the music theory of ukrainian composers in the 1930s and 1940s , namely that of intonation . he taught that intonation refers to the harmonic qualities of a musical piece relative to the pitch of its original instrument , most especially the pitch at which the intonation first appears in the piece.mezhizhnikov considered intonation to be a function of distance . the more distant , the larger the musical consonants in the string and the lower pitch of the vibrato . more distant consonants are more difficult to vocalize . the correct intonation for a piece of music is then a function of the distance from the original instrument to the upper or the middle register .
based on the equal measure rule , the formula he developed for determining intonation , now known as the mezhizhnikov formula , states :


f = f ( s )

= theodor z c3 bcllendorf =
theodor zöllendorf ( 28 september 1814 , kirch-buch – 23 january 1882 , berlin ) was a german philosopher and professor of theology at the university of berlin . his mother elisabeth published him a biography and his brother ferdinand was his son-in-law . he wrote an account of the chief beliefs of the ancient catholic church and served as bishop of trier .


== biography ==
zöllendorf was born in trier , germany . in the year 1820 , as the middle of the civil war , he joined the university of heidelberg . the first few years were extremely hard for him , especially as he was forced to miss his seminary classes and forges , while he struggled with debilitating case of tuberculosis . at the end of the war , however , he was able to obtain a liberal education in the university of göttingen . he then went to freiburg , and at the request of his uncle , the archbishop of freiburg , he received a public benefice of € 5,000 for three years , which enabled him to learn various languages .
in 1842 , he became a professor of theology at the university of berlin , but not the university of freiburg . that university was located in the under-developed region of the german frontier , and so it had little scope for such a person . in the event , at the instigation of a friend ( whose name was not disclosed ) , zöllendorf obtained a medical doctorate from the university of freiburg for 17 and a half years , and he entered upon a literary and other preoccupations .
during this period , he also devoted himself to the study of catholicism in his school ( `` des herrnfassungs-verbreitungschule `` ) of the university of berlin . he was , however , an atheist , who , despite his training , could never understand the philosophy and the nature of christianity . in 1846 , after having long suspected the cause , he gave up all religious discussion . with the creation of the protestant theologian friedrich von ruitzel , he resolved to profess another religion : with ruitzel he took the thesis of the necessity of distinction , in which he fully rejected the belief in the equal unity of all things , and in which he explicitly and especially refuted the theory of god . in 1849 , he formed a religious union with the protestant preacher ernst müller , and became an honorary member of the `` christus arbeitenbarkeit `` ( movement for the strengthening of christian morality ) at berlin . during his many travels in the speaking countries he visited persia and mongolia .
in 1859 he was elected to a sub-ratio of membership of the prussian academy of sciences . here he founded and conducted for twenty years the theological seminary . there he wrote almost four hundred sermons , which formed the basis of all later works of theologians such as bernd fränkel ( 1833–1882 ) , heinrich hildebrandt ( 1833–1885 ) , johann gottlieb westermann ( 1833–1886 ) , julius herrmann ( 1847–1927 ) and robert schwalbach ( 1867–1923 ) .

in berlin , and at st. michael 's church in silesia , he wrote a voluminous , never-published autobiography , `` professor zöllendorf . `` in 1863 he gave his last lectures in berlin , in the presence of the ministers of the society for the propagation of the gospel and the st. peter 's chapel .
he died in berlin on 23 january 1882 , having been 82 years of age .

== academic career ==
jordan entered the department of mathematics and astronomy at johns hopkins in 1961 . he was awarded a baccalaureate in 1967 , and phd in 1970 under ray lankester . he joined the laboratory of computational optics under ernest lawrence in the same year , and the laboratory of physics under james hammer in 1971 . during this time , he was associate professor of mathematics and astronomy , and served as a visiting professor . jordan 's seminar work was not always fruitful for the subject matter , however , particularly in the mathematical physics department . jordan 's major work that bears his name concerned the development of the lankester–dahler theory . during jordan 's time as professor , the mathematical physics department at johns hopkins ( known as the delmonico–jordan complex ) became the center for research in structural physics , specifically nuclear physics . jordan would later leave the group because he found a primary concern to be the continuation of lawrence 's work .
jordan 's graduate student contribution in the mathematical physics department was donald beisstein , who became one of the best-known and most influential theoretical physicists of the 1960s and 1970s . beisstein would go on to be the director of the joint center for computational physics at the mit .
jordan served as assistant professor in both mathematics and astronomy until 1971 . he returned to the computer science department in 1971 , and became the first full-time teaching physicist at johns hopkins . jordan held the chair of the mathematics department until his retirement in 1988 .
jordan moved from johns hopkins to the institute for advanced study in the behavioral sciences in 1990 and taught there until his retirement in 1996 , completing a dissertation in the area of finite element models of decision problems .
jordan 's work was cited in a 1976 article in the `` proceedings of the national academy of sciences `` by lankester , which highlighted jordan 's contribution to the development of computational physics . lankester , who was known for his creative philosophy as a teacher , often said that jordan 's philosophy was akin to newton 's , and the two men were on the same page .
the role of the institute for advanced study in computational physics is primarily to stimulate research and development of techniques that will improve our understanding of the physics of systems and forces .
jordan was a member of the national academy of engineering and the national academy of sciences . he was a fellow of the american physical society , the american mathematical society , and the american association for the advancement of science .


== achievements ==
jordan authored or co-authored more than 150 scientific papers and authored a book on statistical physics .

franklin 's work was relevant for the transition from pre-darwinian biology to modern biological systems , the holomarche . he introduced the concept of emergent biology to the field of embryology .
franklin married margaret hill , the daughter of a boston lawyer . they had two children . in 1950 they went on to have five children . the franklin children live in berkeley , california . margaret founded the society for comparative anatomy and comparative physiology in 1954 . in 1966 she was inducted into the american zoological hall of fame .
franklin is commemorated in the scientific names of several animals :
franklin was the first person to name a new species of freshwater fish , cephalotoma niger , in the journal annals of the new york academy of sciences .
the marine organism ( boma species ) franklinidae was named for him .
franklin 's early research on viruses focused on herpes simplex virus and herpes simplex sarcoma . however , franklin 's experiments with the bacterium salmonella heirogluvirus led him to discover the diphtheria toxin lysozyme.in the 1980s , franklin published a work with suzanne albertson-brandeis , elizabeth johnstone and others entitled human speciation in africa , which summarised what had happened in the pacific , indian ocean , east africa and the sahara , and delineated the `` geologic arc `` of human migration from africa to the americas . franklin also contributed to the list of 26 names of vertebrates that are etymologically related to humans , and the existence of the genus franklinius .

franklin has been described as `` the final brain trust of least energy `` ( geoffrey quine ) , and underwrote two of the three research programmes of the american association for the advancement of science . the anthropologist robert kroeber was also a longtime franklin supporter .

= jos c3 a9 percival =
josé julián percival , londres ( spanish : [ ˈjoːɲɾat ˈtəpɛ̃bɛl ] ; 18 december 1841 – 23 may 1927 ) , was a young argentine jesuit priest , politician and sociologist . his son was cardinal jorge mario percival .


== biography ==
percival was born at abadea in sinaloa . he attended the jesuit seminary of quirigues , where he studied geology and sociology . later he became a cardinal . he became the district chaplain of azuay , capital of perú province . in 1894 he became vicar general of quirigues , a post which he held until his death .
in 1900 , percival was elected a member of the spanish legislative assembly for the province of quirigues .
on 25 october 1913 he became one of the founding members of the central government of the ecuadorian republic ( oas ) , and a member of the founding congress of the socialist student movement ( psuc ) in the city of quirigues ( of which he was first deputy president and in which he served as the editor ) . he represented that province from 1911 to 1914 and in 1917 from 1918 to 1918 as well as from 1918 to 1918 .
percival died on 23 may 1927 , the year of the state anniversary of the imperial spanish republic ( sifr ) . he was a leading voice in the third national government of the bolivarian republic of venezuela ( bolivarian republic of venezuela ) .


== writings ==
percival 's work largely focused on sociology and political economy and provided an intellectual and intellectual bridge for the later argentine revolution . he was the first to identify the emergence of a socialist society in ecuador and during the next fifteen years , percival and his fellow jesuit alejandro laguna began working out the ideas of an economic socialist society .
he had a strong interest in public education as well as economic economics , and was also a political economist . in his inaugural address in quirigues in 1897 , percival made the following statement :

from the perspective of social action , the spiritualists point out that there are two modes of economic activity . the first—the side of production which makes things , and uses them for human welfare—is for the specific class of the individual . the second—the side of production in which individuals rest their lives on the fruits of production , and produces goods to make themselves better off—in short , the economic self-realization of the individual—has to do with the social action of the multitude , as in the value-creators . at the present time , both methods—both ultimately universal and without controversy—have come to be referred to as the system of market relations , or what algernon sidney calls the universal social order . this order consists of a system of money for all the people , an order of production which has all of the characteristics of a universal social community—social intercourse for the individual , and of mutual assistance between individuals , so that in total the burden of production , what social intercourse is but a mere station to be removed , can now be divided among each individual .
percival had a great influence in the late 20th century , with his doctoral student lina huber translating the works of peirats . he was also involved in political economy during the time of juan perón and in the early part of the 1960s .

aubrey edward bala ( 1915–1996 ) was an american nuclear physicist and particle physicist . he was most known for his pioneering and influential work on cross-band magnetism in semiconductors . his influential ideas remain relevant to a large number of applications .


== early life and education ==
aubrey edward bala was born in philadelphia on august 25 , 1915 . he received a b.s . in electrical engineering from the university of pennsylvania in 1927 , and was a fulbright scholar in the usa from 1932 to 1937 . he then joined the physics department at the university of california , berkeley in 1937 as assistant professor of physics .


== professional career ==
in the us , bala took part in the united states navy 's development of radar , and joined the los alamos laboratory as the deputy director in 1944 . he then worked with the us naval research laboratory on radar for many years , and in the 1950s became the laboratory 's associate director , an important post for scientists.in the 1960s , bala became a professor at the university of california , berkeley . he remained in that position until 1982 , and , in his final years , he directed the institute for optics , optics and quantum theory at the university . he died in berkeley , california , in 1996 , and is buried in the uc berkeley aviation and air force heritage center , a quiet residential neighborhood .


== life and legacy ==


=== critical work ===

bala 's fundamental research in theory and application of semiconductor cross-band magnetic momenta began in a paper , `` electron discharge with the stereochronous transistor `` , which he presented to the american physical society in 1930 . the paper , with colleagues j . b . a. randall and r. e. shackelford , anticipated later work by researchers such as robert stoup and ernest lindemann , establishing that the magnetic momenta of a semiconductor could be measured using time and distance variations of the electron path .
the early contributions of aubrey e. bala laid the groundwork for widely adopted cross-band magnetic momenta measurements , and a new field of research—electronic spectroscopy .


=== nobel prize in physics ===

the university of california awarded bala the nobel prize in physics in 1962 for the discovery of the wicker equation , which described the magnetisation of semiconductor surfaces by magnetic moments . the nobel laureate wrote , `` if you read the paper on its own , you will not find anything resembling a name . but remember , in the long term , it will have great significance to particle physics. `` the nobel prize was first presented on may 27 , 1964 , by nobel laureate arno penzias .

sir james laycock ( 13 march 1809 – 18 march 1892 ) was a british politician , civil servant and biographer who served as the house of commons speaker between 1877 and 1882 .


== biography ==
laycock was born in st john 's hall , london , to john laycock , an industrialist who became mayor of bath , and his wife , mary haydon , daughter of john haydon and sir james minnie . his father , sir j. laycock , was in the course of advocating the establishment of schools , and in 1839 , having secured from bishop ferdinand day his support for that purpose , laid the foundation of a new independent cathedral school , a gift from the first lord of st john . laycock was educated at the cornhill school , basingstoke , and at the royal military college , woolwich.he joined the conservatives , but not until 1864 was elected a fellow of the royal society of london , and was so influential that lord rennard became aware of the sudden change of his position . at a private dinner in 1867 he co-sponsored an article entitled `` the government 's war `` , of which , as a member , he was also a member of the royal society . in 1869 he was elected a fellow of the royal statistical society and of the economic association of great britain . he then served as a government advisor until 1881 , when he was forced out of office by the changes of 1881 . the year of the sheep was his last official act .


== social views ==
laycock , along with his successor lord richards , was in favour of introducing a constitution that would extend the franchise to its essential features , without restricting it to male suffrage and education ; and a government or a parliament should be free to legislate as to civil , ecclesiastical and commercial matters . on the other hand , he was a `` socialist `` , and in 1864 , as successor to lord lusby , he wrote the motion of the house of lords which made it compulsory for the house of commons to investigate issues relating to industrial production , a duty which was to be a privilege of parliament .


== politics ==
laycock was for the reconstruction of the post-war parliament after the civil war . he regarded it as incumbent on him to introduce reforms in the war effort and to urge them in parliament . he was at first enthusiastic about making improvements in the relations between the army and the navy , but at a conference of his conservative colleagues , he sharply criticised them for their utter indifference to the services that the navy rendered to britain , and particularly the navy 's great contribution to the strength and capability of the air fleet . nevertheless , his intervention in 1881 marked the end of his career .

rélob fréval ( 8 december 1907 – 29 september 1999 ) was a french philosopher , physicist , mathematician , geneticist , paleontologist and cofounder of the centre national de la recherche scientifique , a leading centre for paleontology in france .


== biography ==
born in liège , fréval studied physics at the universities of liège and bordeaux , and became fascinated by the theory of special relativity and began to read modern physics more seriously . following this interest , he decided to join the french government in 1952 as a science minister , serving as minister from 1962 to 1965 . in 1966 , the cnr appointed him director of the natural history museum , a position he would hold until 1988 . as part of this work , he led the team that discovered spheroidal molluscs on the southern ocean and travelled to australia and canada , discovering the fossil footprints of velociraptor.during the same period he was also an author and academic researcher , notable for working out the law of identity , the importance of alpha and beta decay , and the computation of periodicities . he published more than 100 papers and monographs . fréval died of heart failure in 1998 . he was survived by his wife of 43 years , françoise – who later became a nobel laureate .


== life ==
fréval 's parents were jean and emile-émile fréval . both of his parents were french-born . his paternal grandfather , hermann , was a founding member of the french republic and a founder of the social party in the late 19th century . françoise 's maternal grandfather , alois fréval , was the founder and first president of the société d'extrême fatality , the society that advocated the treatment of lost limbs , including women 's lost limbs.the family moved to london in 1923 , where françoise studied under william thomson and built up a considerable amount of scientific knowledge.in 1924 he graduated with first class honours from the university of liège . in 1926 he became a phd student at the university of bordeaux . his thesis concerned an area with high atmospheric pressure . this concerned the study of molecular droplets and he was awarded a phd the following year . in 1930 he became a researcher at the cavendish laboratory . in 1936 , he became the director of the natural history museum , which he would remain in for three decades . he became assistant director of the natural history museum in 1949 , a post he held until his retirement in 1971 . during this time he also published some 700 papers and monographs .
he became director of the cavendish laboratory in 1950 , a post he would hold until 1988 . fréval was heavily involved in the study of the morphology of the vertebrate fossils that he discovered in the southern ocean . the southern mainland of north africa – known as the mauritius triangle , or the molluscs – had been described by french paleontologist étienne geoffroy-le pen in 1933 . with owen burrell , john overbeek , brian moore and bernard boévy , fréval and burrell mapped the fossils found in the region . in these papers they showed that they were of `` embryic origin `` – 'biologically isolated'from their mother 's mollusks . even the name of the group of marsupials that came to be known as floresia , ( `` yellow-billed platypuses `` ) , may have come from this discovery .
in 1957 , fréval and his colleagues analysed the jaw bones and teeth of three vertebrates – the endegoliform sturgeon , the hemoglobinous ocean snail sphenodon and the pachyderm scavenger sceloporus , and concluded that they came from reptiles that had survived the last ice age . he also analyzed other mammals – including homo habilis , the oldest known human – , and concluded that he was `` the only paleontologist to identify a group of homo-sciurusiens by regard to their tooth geometry and jaw morphology `` . the last time someone had confidently recognised the grouping was by carolus linnaeus , in 1885 .

hugo grotz ( german : [ hɛɛ ] ; 9 march 1891 – 24 november 1975 ) was a german-born american violinist and composer . he is most notable for the composition of the opera gipsy danger in tenor and piano .


== biography ==
hugo grotz was born on 9 march 1891 in munich to anton grotz , a retired baritone of the teutonic order , and sophie czemka . he studied violin at the leipzig conservatory and at the berlin-based max vogel conservatory where his father , also a violinist , worked under paul hindemith .
in 1909 , grotz was commissioned by the russian empire as a violinist for the hetalia opera in saint petersburg . he was the master cellist for the inaugural opera . he performed that premiere in a modified version of the hungarian folk song style which was first performed in istanbul in 1913 . the opera was one of the first successes of g. usserviz . as a violinist , grotz composed and performed his own scores , especially the multi-movement gipsy danger ( 1927 ) , performed at the 1936 world 's fair in washington , dc . the score was originally composed for two pianos , but grotz had to substitute these two instruments for the two traditional concert-game pianos to accommodate an increased audience size . his version of gipsy danger had some parallels with that of chopin and liszt , but was also distinctly unique in how he developed the music to the choral techniques of mazurkas , polka and rachmaninoff . it is significant that grotz was instrumental in writing the text for this work , which was written by hermann heyde and ernst gerhard herzog and premiered by wilhelm stein ( conductor of the bach and rachmaninoff hall orchestra , 1910–11 ) .
in 1927 , grotz joined the prague philharmonic orchestra ( now known as the kreisau circle ) , a highly trained professional orchestra which also included liszt , chopin , schumann , and debussy . from 1927 to 1933 grotz was a professor at the juilliard school , but he never returned to teaching there . grotz retired from the prague philharmonic in 1934 . he married rebecca cohn ( 1889–1990 ) in 1933 and they had three children , hector ( who would go on to become a noted classical pianist ) , hanna , and patricia ( born 1955 ) .in the late 1940s , grotz turned to violin-making as a career and joined the offenbach-la mer for the large-scale work nacht der fliegende ( 1936 ) . in the late 1950s and 1960s , he also composed works for organ and chamber music . among his larger-scale works was the opera circus bleu ( 1960 ) in which he played an unnamed character in the role of the inimitable madame bovary . from 1955 , grotz also appeared on many radio programs promoting the work of josef kosminsky and other great austrian composers .
grotz served as a viola soloist in the cantata les musketeers du bassin et la guerre ( 1950 ) and the orchestral pieces andante for piano ( 1961 ) and le musique ( 1962 ) . he also composed cello sonatas ( string quartet ) , which were largely for the bbc symphony orchestra , and conducted schubert and liszt recitals . his choirsman has been noted as having a particular talent for arranging the minuets of mozart . a book was published in 1968 called lo professeur grotz : his art of strings which details his day to day practice of orchestral playing . in 1971 he retired from the violin making profession . he also continued to write as a composer and was a staff member for the minnesota orchestra .
grotz died in minneapolis on 24 november 1975 at age 83 .

after completing his doctorate , he started working in the department of anatomy and later in the department of geology of the university of leiden .
in 1923 he went to ceylon and a few years later to gabon as a public health officer and in 1928 to india .
in 1948 arrighi received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for the theory of the paragamete hormone receptor and for the determination of a normal stem cell type .
a telegram by arrighi received after his death was :

that eon there beseems i never again had so much to learn . never forget how my colleagues working at the faculté de biologie reported back on that day in '98 , on the discovery of the phosphatidylinositol 3,5-diamidino-4-hydroxypyrimidine ( phosphatidylinositol 4-o-acetate ) cell , described me as only the first to bring this discovery into view .
.

== research ==
arrighi 's research focused on the paragamete hormone receptor ( pir ) .
it is believed that the pir influences action of gonadotropin , and has a direct effect on sexual development .
arrighi is the first to show that circadian rhythms of adrenal secretion are important in the regulation of sexual differentiation .
in 1929 , arrighi published a study on the detection of psychotropic steroids produced in a sexually mature mouse when injected with an apocrine hormone .

at the turn of the 20th century , typhus fever had become a leading cause of death in the british isles , and an epidemic epidemic was rampant . harlandhund 's early work led him to the opinion that the malarial and sclerotinoid-tolerant mosquito probably produced its infection via the bite of an infected mosquito . although he subsequently supported an association of the bite of a malay asian mosquito with typhus , his own research of disease transmission suggests the possibility that the disease arises from contact with a host 's blood cells from another species . his research of the plasmodium parasites from what he called `` mothers `` , proved important in elucidating the source of the disease , and found that women from asia , predominantly china , brought the disease with them to denmark .
he is most notable for his work in typhus that has been dedicated to the discovery of a vaccine that is less likely to cause disease to infected humans . his research was instrumental in the development of vaccine treatments for typhus a , in which anti-siphon life-suppresses agents and antisera for typhus .
he has also worked to confirm the identity of the human form of streptococcus mutans for a strain of streptococcal bacteria .
the medical name for this bacterium , edemyscus mutans , in the genus bubo , is named after him .


== honors and awards ==
harlandhund was a commander of the order of the dannebrog ( bd ) . he received many honors , including the carl emden medal , the golden jubilee medal of the royal danish society of medicine , and the order of the dannebrog .

= ramere whitehead =
ramere whitehead ( 1598 – 1652 ) was an english chemist and scientist , best known for a formula for calculating the concentration of salts in water . the mathematical method ramere 's rule ( 1649 ) is often credited as the first formula to identify compounds with a hydrophobic chemical bond ( common to all salts ) . whitehead also developed the first alchemically aciding agent ( salt water ) for the production of alcohol , and a new idea for purifying acids by removing indium and indigo from alcohols .


== early life ==
whitehead was born on 9 april 1598 , in peterborough , yorkshire . his father , george whitehead , was a principal dealer in salt at peterborough . his uncle , the family landowner and overseer thomas whitehead , died in 1611 . in 1606 , whitehead was educated at the seminary of barnet , and was admitted at trinity college , cambridge in 1613 . from 1615 he was a scholarship student at the university of leipzig .


== career ==
in 1618 , he began studying chemistry under martinus zacharias schmoller , the founder of german science and engineering at cambridge . he obtained his phd from cambridge in 1622 , under the supervision of james conis . in 1627 , he was appointed a professorial fellow at the royal college of science , oxford . in 1634 , he succeeded joseph priestley as a professor of chemistry at cambridge , where he remained until his death . he taught william birrell newcomb , who became an extraordinary-director of the london school of medicine , and charles veitch , who became a member of the royal society . whitehead was a member of the new naturalist society , and a fellow of the linnean society .
whitehead was awarded an obe in 1631 , and was appointed assistant secretary at the university of oxford in 1639 . on 7 july 1641 , he married anne de skene , widow of richard osbern , a tradesman .


== notable achievements ==
a salt made of malicite , which became a favorite of alexander wotton , was named after him in 1635 . whitehead had discovered that the alchemical use of an acid , such as lime , resulted in a lessened or dilute reaction , and derived the formula for `` a solution of lime in water , with an equal amount of salt , by diluting it with wine `` ; but as he knew little chemistry , he largely used a simple formula based on a scientific observation of the reactions in acids .
whitehead 's name is associated with a quantity of chloride of lime , traditionally known as `` whitehead 's salt `` , which is first discovered by joseph priestley . it has since become widely used in chemical laboratories for measuring the concentration of salts in solutions of potassium hydroxide ( koh ) . it has also been used for the prevention of pulmonary abscesses .
whitehead 's law states that the concentration of a substance in solution ( potassium hydroxide ) is an exponent of the linnæan degree of hardness . this law was later known as the lambert–whitehead law , after the mathematician , and self-proclaimed inventor , henry lambert ( 1736–1813 ) , who developed the principle .

== career ==
while a professor at the university of oslo , leske joined the staff of the geological survey of the island of hedeby . between 1918 and 1922 , he worked on an expedition to check the completeness of a map of east greenland which the royal norwegian academy of sciences presented to the government of norway in february 1922.leske served as the expedition 's first scientific representative in greenland.on 19 january 1928 , leske was elected to the national academy of sciences of denmark , and became a member in 1934 .
his most notable scientific work was on fossil fishes . as he had received his ph.d. in the university of tübingen , he was able to study the fishes of the gulf of corse , which had then been a local area of scientific interest . according to prof. f. gundersen : `` we then began to go to italy , and under lemleana parhake we began two expeditions to tell more generally the fishes of the sandwich islands . ``

when he went to algeria in 1945 , he sent a message to erhard stumpf , german foreign minister , that he was going to liberate algeria from islam , and the french were of the opinion that germany should get involved in the region . fraenkel wanted france to take over the energy trade with algeria , with the power to set the terms for the extraction of oil . after negotiations with the french , albert speer , then-vice-chancellor of germany , told fraenkel to get out of algeria . however , fraenkel also warned stumpf that if france was not compelled , the soviet union would succeed in liberating algeria . fraenkel instructed stumpf that he was from russia and that he could not negotiate with him.fraenkel remained in algeria after the war was over , and was asked to help in reforming the french economy . in 1952 , fraenkel went to moscow , where he was invited to become a director of siboga communications , a russian company . in this position he was concerned with establishing a national radio system with the cooperation of the local telephone and telegraph companies , while also working on the soviet-controlled communications experiment station ( cpsu ) . fraenkel resigned in 1954 , and was replaced by hermann seligman . he returned to germany in 1956 and remained in this post until he died in 1963 .
fraenkel is known for his service in the german air force , as well as in military and technical matters . fraenkel specialized in navigation and aeronautical equipment , and was a major in the german v-2 development program during the war . he established the air-speed research laboratory at bielefeld to develop airplanes and jets , and built the do 26 jet , the world 's first supersonic jet powered by a liquid-fuel engine , which flew during the final test flight in 1959 , just before the end of the war . he used the british vega , a supersonic bomber , to perform blind aeronautical tests , with the plan of combining the twin-engined vega with a more efficient turboprop aircraft to provide the ultimate supersonic machine . in his spare time he was also interested in biological research . he wrote a work on `` the air element in babies `` , and held an interest in the defence industry .

= `` george christy `` =
george christy ( june 19 , 1887 - june 10 , 1942 ) was a british physicist , pioneer of dynamical fluid mechanics , and co-discoverer of ferromagnetism .
christy first took a course in mathematics at balliol college , cambridge in 1895 . by 1901 , he had graduated with an m.sc . in physical chemistry from the university of edinburgh . in 1903 , he joined the royal college of science as a physics lecturer and later became its head of the chemistry department . in 1907 , he won the royal society 's turing medal , awarded by lord kelvin , for demonstrating that materials flow in a closed loop .
by 1916 , he was dean of the engineering faculty at the university of london . in that year , he coined the term `` monoclinic contraflow `` to describe how a moving fluid smoothly flows between two points on the surface of a globe , which is necessary to accurately describe what a fluid could have been . this same principle , that particles flow in straight lines , is usually known as `` monoclinic contraflow `` . christy 's and kelvin 's lines'shared the same intuitive quality ; as moore states , `` it was his idea that conic section had to be displayed in triangles and planar triangles. `` it also would be an error , moore clarifies , to think that these curves were `` certainly 'infinite'lines , and that 'flat'points'could not be anything but points ' , whereas the flow of fluids within liquids , with the necessary 'order ' ( or , in other words , if the lines went in circles , they had to have precisely defined lines ) . ``
in 1927 , he designed the first self-contained dynamical fluid laboratory , which was based on the model of a vacuum tube that supplied an inner tube containing three lids for the magnets , a fourth tube filled with solvent , and a vacuum that the upper secondary for each metal flowed into . using the monoclinic contraflow principle , it was possible to determine the velocity at which the solvents flowed into the first tube and continue to the second , and the third , and so on , adding up the flow speed . the resulting flow data could then be used to model flow in the rest of the machine , or to probe the wavefunctions that distinguish slow-acting liquid from more rapid-acting .
christy is also well known for another discovery : the mineral potassium ores . in 1925 , christy 's son , richard christy , a professor of biochemistry , began studying chemical isotopes of potassium , of which he found an isotope whose ratio to beryllium was positive and positive-to-negative . he went on to obtain isotope ratios to two to three standard deviations higher than those expected from the age of the earth . when his son 's work was published in 1929 , christy noted that he had `` solved the problem without naming a new element , though he made some research in a few scientific papers which , it is said , are amusing nonsense `` . a century later , barry zinn claimed in the second edition of his book metaphysics and cosmology that

... stephen g. christy , in his article on ten years ago ( published in `` science `` ) wrote of chemistry that the lines of a liquid that has a density greater than the energy given by ‘ potassium fluoride ’ ( that is , higher than 250 mev per gram of salt ) flow slower than the lines of a liquid whose surface area is only twice that . on this reading , his assertion that the lines of the sodium fluoride , which are thought to be too heavy to flow at all , are carried by conical streams could hardly be more disregarded ; there is an element of chemistry , however well-known , which is within reach of mankind , namely the hydraulic operation of cooling salt of various degrees of hardness in chambers , for cooling the atmospheres of coal , gold , and silver mines , where the boiling and cooling of superfluid gases are of great importance .
the first reference to `` pure metal `` was made by christy in 1910 , but it took about 40 years for other authors to provide these original proofs of his .

st john finn oskar ( 22 december 1880 – 20 february 1955 ) was a finnish-american physicist and one of the founders of radar research . he was a member of the industrial and socioeconomic advisory committee , the delegation of science and technology for southeast asia , and of the committee on transportation , railways , and communications ( ctsc ) for the developing countries . he was elected fellow of the royal society in 1934 .


== early years ==
finn oskar was born in aalin . his parents were finnsten aikar and marie magdalena aikar ( 1885–1969 ) . his younger brother was gudrun aikar ( 1906–1996 ) . finn aikar oskar went on to graduate in physics from the university of helsinki . he then moved to the united states and began working with ernest lawrence at the lawrence radiation laboratory in princeton , new jersey . after working there , oskar moved to the marshall scientific research institute in chicago to work with robert oppenheimer at the los alamos laboratory . from there , he worked with boris isserles ( 1905–1986 ) , hans von ohm ( 1913–1998 ) , and harold walker ( 1916–1983 ) . among his co-workers were robert mccormick and rudolf sommerfeld .


== work at los alamos ==
oskar joined los alamos in 1917 as a project officer , and worked on the princeton experiment known as the larmor experiment . the k-hole experiment was established at los alamos in 1935 in order to measure gravitational wave effects caused by the collaboration between ernest lawrence and guglielmo marconi . a k-hole is the inside of a sphere surrounded by the gravitational field of a very large mass . the k-hole is a source of gravitational waves . oskar designed a tube from an old vacuum tube that they thought would be suitable for the larmor experiment . they were confident enough in this tube that it would be used and eventually become the first optical part of the larmor detector . from there , he left los alamos in january 1934 and began working at the jpl .


== later career ==
in 1937 , oskar was appointed head of the physics laboratory in the government experimental station in gobi . in 1947 , he was appointed director of the physical laboratory in tucson , arizona . in 1963 , he was appointed director of the materials science laboratory at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) in gaithersburg , maryland . in 1975 , he was named general manager of dst industries . he served in that capacity until his retirement in 1993 .

john cantle frse frse ( 7 december 1886 – 3 february 1948 ) was a scottish geologist and palaeontologist who was active in the field of fossil and fossil-bearing minerals in british columbia .


== life ==
john cantle was born in august 1907 . he graduated from the university of aberdeen in 1911 and won the john marshall university prize in 1914 for his thesis ,
`` the thirring plateau of kent `` . cantle 's phd was funded by the natural history museum , aberdeen and two of his doctoral students were awarded phds from the university of manchester in 1920 .
john cantle left edinburgh in 1928 to work in britain for the geological survey of great britain ( gss ) . during this time he became a friend of murray roth and arranged for him to visit edinburgh and to take a team of ten students to various fossil specimens in the kairroos mountains . roth was interested in science and was very keen to learn about fossils . cantle collaborated with murray roth on a number of stories that he and murray wrote together about the natural history of fossils in scotland . he developed an interest in fossilised bog shells and the different varieties of mould found in them . when roth suggested that cantle join the team he was to become his greatest rival and manager . john cantle , his wife and children had to be accommodated in an army barracks as the germans , occupying the hills around falkirk , were closing in on the university .
he worked at the gss during the winter of 1928–1929 and the summer of 1929–1930 in the new world off the coast of south georgia . in the 1930s he began collecting fossils for the gss . some of his research focussed on the geology of china and the aurignacian period in india . in 1935 he relocated to the united states of america , for a period of two years and as the war league was called the field artillery and police department ordered that no land was to be used for occupation of any part of the usa during the war . cantle returned to edinburgh but soon found his home deserted . john cantle died on 3 february 1948 .

== biography ==
st. louis was born on november 22 , 1919 , in northfield , minnesota . his father was a farmer and his mother , norma , was a schoolteacher . he attended johnson high school in minneapolis .
st. louis graduated from dartmouth college with a degree in 1942 . his dissertation , the inductive structure of language , appeared in the journal j.l.stuart . in 1951 , he earned a ph.d. from the university of chicago.st . louis is credited with helping popularize and encourage attention to language in a manner similar to that achieved by georg cantor , by showing that those with good language skills could explain the use of some language constructs in a straightforward and unambiguous manner . his first publications focused on language semantics , a topic that he turned to after he was fired from johns hopkins university in 1954 . his first book , structural analysis of propositions ( 1956 ) , was about functional calculus . although most of the initial work of functional calculus was done in the 1940s and 1950s , and the relevant techniques did not become widespread until the mid-1980s , it was st. louis 's own efforts that introduced the field to the general public and opened the door to much experimentation with data and interpretation techniques . he is also credited with coining the term `` structural programming `` to refer to an approach to theory construction that means the assumption of certain formal structure by means of a set of `` introspective foundations `` .
he co-founded the institute for the study of language ( then the language foundation ) , and was its president from 1961 to 1964 . the language foundation won its first wilson lecture in 1975 .
in 1980 , he was appointed president of the american statistical association .
he served as chair of the president 's advisory council from 1981 to 1989 . he was also the president of the association of university professors of language , history and statistics ( awstsi ) from 1989 to 1994 .
he died of prostate cancer in a nursing home in columbia , new york on december 6 , 2008 .


== legacy ==
st. louis led the way in the use of empirical methods and statistical concepts in language analysis . he set the intellectual standard for scientific analysis , and established a technique for the systematic use of information on language structures . he brought these procedures and methods to bear on both the organization of languages , and on problems in the analysis of phenomena in language .

born at cirencester , sussex , he was educated at the local grammar school and then in the university of st. andrews , with a particular interest in physics and mathematics . his father , thomas rawcliffe hodge , was a doctor and came to england with thomas rawcliffe wakefield ( 1715–1775 ) from london . hodge earned a bsc in 1773 and a doctorate in 1774 . he studied under andrew fludd ( 1727–1807 ) , james thomson ( 1747–1832 ) and christopher wren ( 1744–1810 ) .


== career ==
in 1784 , hodge became professor of physics at the royal college of surgeons in london . in 1797 he was made an examiner in physics , and had a small practical base there for a period of time , when a summer trip to paris interrupted this . in 1799 he made the acquaintance of henry miley ( 1726–1815 ) , whom he subsequently married in 1799 . the two men had a very close relationship and this allowed hodge to research briefly in chemistry and magnetism .

hodge applied his theoretical chemistry to physics and set up a laboratory in st. john 's chapel , one of the first buildings of its kind in the country.he was , in connection with the preparation of the principles of chemistry , one of the editors of the philosophical transactions of the royal society in 1817 . his publication included an exhaustive analysis of the ordinary vibrations of acids , the electricity and magnetism in those chemicals , and of the properties of metals.this was followed in 1813 by a treatise on magnetism ( also known as the magnetism of carbonic acid , metals , and transistors ) , where he proposed the world 's first magnetisation principle . in 1818 , having also studied glass , he set up his own business , selling the production of glass to glass manufacturers . he married the daughter of the rev . george howard ( 1781–1840 ) , the first non-royal to hold this post in the church of england , on 3 april 1822 . after his retirement from his clerical career , hodge assumed the periodical duties of editor , in 1825 to 1829 . on his death the magazine published a continuation of his work under the title of materia medica magna ( 1828–1837 ) , which succeeded in perpetuating his prestige in chemistry . he also co-edited with wren , physica chemistry . in 1836 , john tennant , london , publisher of those papers , offered him an appointment as editor and declared him `` one of the greatest modern students and practitioners of the more general science of physics `` .in 1839 he became acting examiner for science and for three years was president of the royal institution of the royal society , the first non-royal to hold the post . he was one of the founders of the royal academy of arts and letters , holding the chair until 1846 . in 1849 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and in 1851 its president .

irving bright beyers ( 1882–1950 ) was a well known figure in the fields of late 19th and early 20th century physiology . he is best known for his interest in animal locomotion , leading him to be one of the most frequently cited inventors of hydraulic or electric shock therapy in both the u.s. and europe . he invented a lot of different devices and most of them resulted in actual medical applications .
he was born in the southern united states to robert beyers , a photographer and railroad passenger , and ada wynn beyers . he graduated from new york 's cortlandt school of music , then continued in new york university . in 1889 he started work in new york university 's mechanical engineering department , where he earned his master 's degree in 1903 . in 1906 , at age 27 , he made his first trip through the north american continent . he never thought of becoming a geologist .
in 1913 , he started working as an instrument man for the cleveland municipal electric company , but switched to electrical engineering in 1916 . he stayed at this company until his retirement in 1943 . in 1919 he opened his own laboratory in new york city . he made the first electric shock device for humans , called the `` acute shock `` , and used it to treat `` wax-sucking `` . in a later device he used an oscilloscope to collect energy in rats .


== notable inventions ==
the ampules used in a . bright 's experiment could produce blood pressure changes that were as much as 8 times as strong as those of arterial gas or lightning strikes . his work extended to improvements in the electric shock treatment of sick rats , sheep and pigeons . in 1940 , he created the shock tube that he thought would treat depression , and in 1949 , discovered that shock therapy for respiratory distress is equally efficacious as chemical help . in 1957 he invented an electric shock device that could take the victim from a bed and continue stimulating the heart as long as they were alive . in 1960 he reported that the most useful electric shock was more potent than anesthesia.while an electrical engineer and pioneer in animal physiology , beyers was also an accomplished bassoonist who played the bassoon at the arrogant monk hall in east harlem . he later became the oboist for the ballets russes.in addition to numerous inventories of devices , beyers also made several experiments on living animals . in 1907 , he showed that morphine is addictive as a stimulant . in 1914 , he demonstrated that the effect of sedatives on animals is dependent on how much they expose them to : lights , sounds , smells or cold . in 1916 he and his co-worker edward waite carried out an experiment in which they performed cataclysms and electric shock on rabbits .

= henry west =
henry west frs ( 10 october 1882 – 26 november 1942 ) was an english physician and plant pathologist who was famous for isolating the rare parasitic fenugreek disease haemophilus pneumoniae . his publications in nature influenced the discovery of the immune reaction to the organism .


== biography ==
west was born in southampton and educated at southampton grammar school , then the earl 's school in gloucester . after earning his md from st mary 's hospital in 1899 , he practised in a small practising school in westgate for the rest of his life .
in 1903 he joined the imperial college of tropical medicine and hygiene where , shortly before the outbreak of the first world war , he worked with the interwar plague experts . in october 1917 he joined the royal army medical corps as a botanicalist , before moving to the cavendish laboratory where he worked on producing anthrax and for many years discovered many new pathogenic fungi . west gave up professional duties to concentrate on scientific research in 1918 , undertaking the first scientific assessment of the nature of the plague in england . in 1927 he introduced the isolation of a dangerous black widow 's disease pathogen , haemophilus pneumoniae , in wales , as a cure . his results suggested that the disease was spread through contact with the blood and muscle of a healthy infected victim , a conclusion later confirmed by both james radcliffe , the british army 's chief of bacteriology , and henry draper , founder of the american bacteriological department . it was noted by those involved in the investigation that west had been particularly favourable to radcliffe and draper , and in particular to draper for his help . although the legion of merit award was granted to west for his services , the outbreak of the first world war proved the real reason for his retirement from the royal army medical corps . his insistence on imposing high standards on medical work and in particular on blood research was demonstrated by his influence on a number of top scientists in britain , including richard lewis thompson ( one of the first american microbiologists ) , gino bailli , john mackintosh , and w. hewitt stearns .
west died on 26 november 1942 from pneumonia following a brief illness . his research on the plague spread the same way he had promised : through leaflets placed in the homes of infected families . the women were urged to draw the blood of sick and convalescent persons in order to collect any blood in the family 's home , leaving it with a host of parasites that could then be taken home to cause the disease . a common misconception in the eyes of some had been the theory that body contact with the blood of healthy people ensured a cure , but west was clear in his identification and diagnosis : it was the process of incubation and contact between the patient and blood that developed the fever and caused the clinical symptoms . west showed that a host of blood-borne protozoa could transfer pathogenic in the blood of an infertile person , and he immediately alerted world health organisation authorities .


== scientific contributions ==
west conducted much of his research and clinical work in england with the legionnaires'disease research unit in colchester , assisted by albert costas after he became director of the unit . west is known for the public relations campaign of laying hard and fast foundations and turning out campaigners such as william horner and terence maugham for the outbreak in rotherham ; this was almost entirely to provide support to children , both from the rotherham association ( the local school ) and adults in rotherham , and the environment .

carl-ludwig gerd ( february 12 , 1903 – march 8 , 1993 ) was a german-born american physicist , best known for his contributions to applied mathematics , numerical physics , fundamental mechanics , statistical mechanics , plasma physics , infrared radiation , and plasma optics . he became a citizen of the united states in 1951 and is buried at auburn hills memorial park .


== biography ==
carl-ludwig gerd ( 1863–1934 ) was born in stuttgart , germany . he received his secondary education in strasbourg and berlin and in 1921 completed his first ph.d. under rudolf lorentz in munich . in 1925 , he joined friedrich-wilhelm niemann university ( today ’ s eth zurich ) as an assistant professor and held the professorship there until his death . from 1929 to 1930 , he also worked at the technical university of berlin , where he conducted research into plasma physics , magnetic fields , and scattering problems . in 1933 , he joined the faculty of the german technical university of munich ( german : dthum , also known as eth münchen ) . later , gerd was made associate professor and professor emeritus at the institut für physik in 1930 and professor emeritus at the university of liège in 1933 .
gerd authored the widely used `` quantum mechanics `` textbook with alfred reichert ( 1900–1972 ) and the book with felix klein ( 1929–1985 ) . gerd is noted for coining the terms `` background `` ( baryon electron ) and `` zero point `` ( electron pair ) to denote the least probable electron states of particles in the positron and muon.he is considered the founder of quantum field theory , and was the first to apply einstein 's theory of general relativity to study particles in the high energy state.gerd also played an important role in the development of the theory of the sheaf . while at dthum , he was also the first to give an explicit explanation of the differential integrals ( included in the lorentz–gerd formulation of a wave equation ) by which the magnetic field of a wave appears to change with the polarization ( orientation ) of its reflection ( warping ) , giving an efficient formula for estimating its magnitude . he eventually developed the form of uncertainty principle for quantum field theories in his many papers.on april 29 , 1939 , he married mabel lang and they had two sons and two daughters.gerd was a member of the royal swedish academy of science .


== awards and honors ==
1983 fellowship in the royal swedish academy of science
fellowship in the fraunhofer zentralstelle
honorary doctorate of the university of göttingen ( german : `` freunde in baden `` )

john wesley massey ( november 15 , 1856 – november 15 , 1910 ) was an american zoologist who made significant contributions to the discipline of comparative anatomy , the application of his career as a professor at the university of minnesota and founder of the field of comparative anatomy in the united states . he also taught at several other institutions .


== biography ==
he was born on november 15 , 1856 in minneapolis . after earning a bachelor 's degree in education at the university of minnesota , he started an academic career as a professor of zoology at the university of minnesota .
in 1886 , he became the assistant curator of vertebrates of the minnesota academy of science . from 1888 to 1892 he held the position of curator of the mammalia branch of the bureau of animals of the university of minnesota . in 1891 , he became the first curator of the zoo ( the first zoo in the state ) of the smithsonian institution . after one year of a two-year tenure as director of the zoo , he was chosen as curator of the american museum of natural history in 1905 . he died on november 15 , 1910 .
in addition to a wide range of laboratory and field investigations , he performed comprehensive taxonomic investigations on molluscs and the hoofed marsupial that he examined at the zoo in chicago . he described many new taxa , including the well-known flying insects , the giant buzzard and the skink , as well as amphibians . he also published more than 40 research papers , contributed to and became a significant contributor to scientific journals , and played a key role in making scientific collections and collections of specimens available in the united states.he became the ninth recipient of the dewey medal from the american association for the advancement of science in 1904 , and made the american museum of natural history its honorary curator in 1916 . he received the frisch medal of the american ornithologists'union in 1908 , the stern prize of the american museum of natural history in 1912 , the alfred v. smithian award of the canadian ornithologists'union in 1915 , and the american association for the advancement of science 's distinguished service award in 1918 . he received an honorary doctorate in 1920 from the university of minnesota . his papers are held by the national museum of natural history , in the marine biological laboratory , and in the collections of the smithsonian institution .
massey became a professor of comparative anatomy at the university of minnesota in 1895 . during his career , he pursued many of the major development of comparative anatomy . his main work of the late 19th century was in the field of embryology . in his career as a professional taxonomist , he was known for being an advocate of the views of charles darwin and linnaeus that the inherited characteristics of organisms originated through an ongoing process of evolution . by his standards , darwin was probably correct in asserting that humans share with apes a complex sense of smell and touch . in contrast , he believed that people shared primitive feelings of affection and fear with each other , and to the point where these evolved from earlier form of imitation . according to massey , the more primitive form of creation—common ancestors—may have foreshadowed humans'own evolution . however , most of his colleagues at the university of minnesota and in the zoological community disagreed . by 1909 , massey had developed a nearly universal view that humans were an ape-like transitional species from apes .

massey 's most famous work , the american museum of natural history 's zoological collection , is the smithsonian 's linnaean museum of comparative anatomy and deviations from history . it was named after him by edward d. logan , `` the man who set the agenda for evolution. `` massey donated the museum 's collections to the museum , which was renamed as the massey museum after his death .

norendorf made important contributions to chemical analysis , and he introduced nmr spectroscopy into experimental biology . in 1907 , after more than thirty years in berlin , norendorf accepted a chair in the rensch-eberstelle deutschen physiologie at the technical university of berlin , which he held until 1919 .


== achievements ==
norendorf was responsible for the founding of the laboratory for physical chemistry at the technische hochschule , and with hans lohmann , he created the basis of nmr spectroscopy , which he subsequently published . he was also the co-author of the manuscript on teratology which appeared in the first edition of volume 4 of the german scientific journal , the journal of experimental biology .


=== norendorf ’ s principle of predictive death ===
norendorf 's idea on predictive death was that the disease experienced in a particular patient will sometimes be followed by a decrease in the subsequent prognosis .
norendorf suggested the hypothesis that any change in prognosis indicates a sufficient progressive deterioration in the prognosis . in 1899 , he reported that the `` precisely ” tumor following lung cancer was more likely to have progressed to latent infection when patients were given a “ course of an antibiotic ” , and that to make a prognosis accurate , he required a patient to die before dying of some other cancer , or complications.for a considerable period of time after norendorf ’ s death , in germany , in the late twentieth century , there were efforts to establish a new nomenclature for diseases with predictable prognoses .
the cause of regression is the reason for a previous diagnosis .
pain caused by arthritis has been called an `` asterisk ich nachthen ” ( asterisk principle ) .

= john baines ( humourist ) =
john baines ( 2 june 1844 – 7 september 1908 ) was a british humourist and broadcaster . he worked as editor of one of the earliest early newspapers on german military and naval affairs . he then made an important contribution to the history of satire , from the 1850s to the late 19th century , writing some 200 essays and non-fiction books .
he was born in burney , surrey , the son of j.b. baines ( 1818–1902 ) and mary pinchbeck ( 1840–1903 ) . his older brother , the satirist james baines , was also a novelist , having created a study of crime in the 1850s , and edited the popular memoirs of the 1857 columbian exposition .


== education and career ==
baines studied at eton college in 1881 , and was then awarded a scholarship to study at christ church , oxford . this provided him with an extensive background in germanic culture , and served him well in his career as a historian and comedy writer . as a native of the north of england , he had a long habit of preferring the more civilized education of the educated classes and was talented at the art of creating mockable characters and supplying them with material . with such ease , baines at the age of twenty-two formed the primary plot-point of many of his earlier stories , and perhaps also adapted the gallant protestant , cornish-scottish knight from the two towers , despite his scottish heritage . however , after a period as an unpaid lecturer , when others were leaving the uk to take post-graduate positions in germany , he ultimately abandoned study and moved on to active ministry .


=== glimpses of the italian world ===
baines followed this with a series of books published in 1901 and 1902 , exploring a wide range of topics in the history of italian war and naval affairs . in 1902 , baines was admitted a fellow of the royal society and in 1914 the order of the british empire . in a long letter to his friend , the poet herbert findlay ( 1850-1913 ) , he expresses disgust with the treatment of napoleon 's position in italy , as well as his strategic misdeeds . these both point towards the influence that glee in general and humour in particular can have on history , as well as his recommendation for baines not to consider joining the british army .
in later years , baines made occasional appearances as a guest commentator on history , even appearing on the radio , and wrote several autobiographical and memoirs . in 1902 , he invited another old friend , the playwright c. r. lodge , to sing the march of gallipoli to a surviving recruits of the enemy . while he was singing , nine soldiers were blinded by a fireworks display . baines later recalled the experience of watching three men blinded by a sapling blast to the head ; their shocked appearance was the result of hearing so much noise that they thought it was a rifle shot , and , witnessing the amputation of three fingers and the flash of exploding shells , regarded it as `` the greatest feat of human comedy `` he had witnessed .


=== the oldest individualist society and gilbert russell ===
another of baines'works of historical comedy was the creation of an extended satirical system of english county names , setting forth the seeds of the ideas in the early comedy of the oldest individualist society . published posthumously in 1915 , this book has been criticised for containing predictable gags , although many of these were based on original material , and for avoiding in favour of greater historical accuracy .


== later life and death ==
baines died in st peter 's , woolwich , london , and was buried in his ancestral catterick home , at the lambeth cemetery in borough market .

anton de vries , also spelled de vries , ( 2 april 1731 – 8 august 1816 ) was a dutch geographer .
his father , jacob de vries , was a writer of encyclopaedia britannica , and whose library was included in the hall of the dutch academy of arts and sciences in amsterdam . his mother , anna caroline , a bookseller and antiquarian , was a well-known dutch traveller in the dutch east indies , and probably a native of amsterdam .
in 1794 , during the dutch reformation , anton de vries became a catholic ; the reformation was coming to an end in holland , and he became a reformed calvinist , and kept close to it throughout his life . de vries'own opinion on the reformation was positive : he expressed his belief that the reformation was unnecessary , and the protestants true members of the church . thus he believed that all the doctrines of jesus christ were truths which were to be found in christianity . he defended the legitimacy of the reformed churches and their institutions . de vries took special care that his view should never be misunderstood or misunderstood ; this is evident by his attitude to protestant missions in holland and in england . he also tried to establish peace between the protestants and the catholic church ; when english travellers went to dutch holland to learn about the reformation , he was , no doubt , very pleased to make arrangements for their stay in dutch towns , so that they might return home later to hear the protestant preacher preach and judge for themselves whether he was right . one of his best-known sermons was delivered at amsterdam in 1777 , upon the day of the plague . this speech was published in a pamphlet at his request in 1775 . he also took part in the suppression of the congregational church at amsterdam ; this took place at the instigation of johan van der lubbe .
de vries was probably one of the three men who , in september 1651 , surveyed the western coast of canada , perhaps the most important of any geographical survey to make a thorough sketch of the country 's terrain , geography and climate .
among the works cited in de vries 's pamphlet the geography of the world by his enquiry into the movements and accomplishments of the engravers and weavers is `` which furthers to further the antiquities of man , and their revealing ways , with full reference to the orientals and modes of relation. ``

horace drake frs ( september 21 , 1922 – september 5 , 2004 ) was a british–american geneticist .


== biography ==
horace drake graduated with a degree in mathematics from leeds university , earning his phd on the `` coenzyme-3 enzyme and its mrna `` from harvard university in 1955 . his phd students included john a. lawson , dr. robert meltzer , dr. roland c. hyatt , dr. brian david levy , e. robert jackson , and george albert hauser .
in 1956 he obtained a doctorate in biochemistry from the university of texas at austin . in 1959 he joined the cornell university school of medicine and earned his m.d . in 1960 with a thesis , the role of genes in the significance of differences in drug delivery to and population dynamics .
in the mid-1960s drake went to work at the rockefeller institute for medical research on hereditary diseases and genetics in the birth defects and cancer research laboratories .
he made major contributions in the area of common diseases and genetic variants : from studying the linkage of congenital diabetes to presenilin-t and in detecting signatures of mutations associated with lethal syphilis in pregnancies , he learned about recessive types of sickle cell disease and from 1958 , he became an early expert on altered patterns of chromosome imprinting in diseases such as duchenne muscular dystrophy and alveolar and colic .
the major breakthrough , however , came in 1964 when he and henry d. cowan showed that mutations in a gene known as g protein-coupled receptor ( gpr41 ) functioned as a lifelong alternate control for a genetic disorder caused by the overexpression of the defective gene . more significantly , it was here that drake proposed an explanation for genetic imprinting in inheritance ( disease ) and explained the essential role of regulation of the g protein-coupled receptor in regulatory systems ( pathological changes ) , such as the control of protein secretion and protein kinetics ( how cells and tissues send and receive nutrients and nutrients'metabolic energy ) . he and cowan thus created the model of a genetic predisposition ( in their terminology , disease ) and discovered a way to genetically segregate variants of this particular gene . together , they founded , in 1967 , the genetic epidemiology group ( geg ) and made a foundational contribution to the use of gene-environment interaction models in genetic epidemiology .
drake remained at cornell university until retiring in 1982 . in 1988 he and his wife , margaret , bought a home in duluth , minnesota .
he remained on the faculty of the university of minnesota .
drake was honored with the adolphe and marion guérin family foundation for his leadership in both advancing genetics and in fostering biomedical research .

== career ==
as part of his work on economic cycle theory , he advocated the economic imperative model , which would predict the best course of action for a host of economic actors when faced with a political choice that included certain policies , especially that of the republican presidential nominee ronald reagan . nichols helped refine the doctrine of a cost function ( finding that if the constraints of current economic policy are not great enough , any policy that raises costs can have a marginal increase in output and employment ) and created a novel rule for comparing labor costs with current levels of unemployment in the absence of a growth in available labor markets , as well as an economic equilibrium model , based on the premise that only low wage workers are ever required to accept unemployment benefits.his most significant contributions to macroeconomics came during his tenure at the university of michigan , starting in 1969 . after completing his phd work with colleague e. p. putnam , nichols began work at george washington university as a full professor in 1970 . with george washington university 's industrial development policy program , nichols developed the economic component to the key achievement of the national research council , a new economic development ( ned ) program that set objectives for national economic growth in terms of development and the capacity to improve living standards . nichols'work was the driving force behind the ned and is considered to be the foundation for many subsequent ned programs .
in 1971 , nichols retired as director of the institute for work study , and began the creation of a second-year department of economics endowed chair at the university . nichols'tenure at the university of michigan was historically one of expansion rather than retrenchment , and continued the long-term renewal of the new faculty of economics . during his tenure at the university , nichols championed research by alex m. reichelt and jacques roux , and wrote popular works on macroeconomics for students . in 1999 , nichols retired as a professor at george washington university , and received a government retirement pension of $ 300,000 for 10 years .
in 2005 , nichols was named the 21st president of the international association for the advancement of economic studies .

andré milén ( august 6 , 1877 , villiers – october 31 , 1962 , la jolla , california ) was a french american motorcyclist and stuntman who made major contributions to motorcycle racing and united states motoring . he was described as the `` father of modern motorcycle performance `` by him , george kleynhans , in the preceding chapter of `` thoroughbreds , american racing and speed `` , noting his numerous stunt career victories.milén also competed on the new york/pennsylvania showground ( first in the gun machines and then in the gun airplanes , for the purpose of shooting off high-speed sparks ) and in local motorcycle races in many places . his televised stunt-airs were filmed in many locations in his native france , austria , sweden , australia , switzerland and other european countries . he is also known for many amateur motorcycle races and spectacles in which he appeared alongside professional riders.milén went to school at the conservatoire des beaux-arts in paris , and then started a line of motorcycles in 1947 . by 1959 , milén had changed the colors from khaki to chambray , and he started his own line of motorcycles , as well , also in chambray . he made the short trip from paris to montpellier , france in 1957 , through the united states , where he turned down a number of requests from american racing teams . he then drove to california , where he started his `` moto trail `` , or `` motorcycle racing playground `` , which was apparently named in honor of his father.from 1968 to 1972 he was an editor and broadcaster for `` the early show with jim hoffa `` .


== early career ==

milén began his professional racing career in 1911 as a professional standup in paris 's `` grand prix galeries `` circuit . in 1928 , in the final years of his university career , he entered `` la jolla motorcycle racing , `` the first major american motorcycle racing series , to which he showed tremendous talent . he showed outstanding track speed in the 1960 u.s. grand prix series , for which he won the title and helped his team retain it . milén was , however , officially retired in 1963 , but that season he was just 29 years old . he won a championship in the 1969 u.s. grand prix series . he qualified for the grand prix championship of the grand prix galeries of europe ( in spain ) that same year , although he never got there . milén 's star faded , however , in the 1970 u.s. grand prix series , when he retired . milén 's high-speed guns were so powerful that they were impossible to control , and he ran out of speed control options . milén returned to the united states for the 1972 u.s. grand prix series , when he briefly returned to the famous race circuits of montpellier and antwerp , winning again . milén was again presented with an opportunity to continue racing in the 1973 u.s. grand prix series , but this time he withdrew from competition for seven months due to complications with diabetes , becoming permanently disabled in 1977 . in 1973 milén was featured in the special `` all-american vacation `` photo album for terry winwood , who was invited by his grandmother to present the united states grand prix classifications to milén 's grandfather in new york city .

= filippo corra =
filippo corra ( 11 april 1892 – 29 june 1966 ) was an italian physicist . he discovered the corra effect , a force that acts upon semiconductor displays . this effect describes the photodiodes , the crystalline materials that conduct light . it is the first known photodiodemic structure . his daughter elena corra was also a physicist .


== early life and career ==
corra was born in milan . he was a university student at the university of bologna , where he studied mathematics and physics .
his interest in research began in 1897 when he attended lectures given by professor mio correa . in the same year , corra studied by contact with elektor george steinbeck in königsberg . corra came to the conclusion that early childhood education should be given to children who were involved with art , especially drawing .
in 1905 corra became an assistant in correa 's physics department , and he was among the first students to introduce the use of biometrical measurements as a basis for teaching mathematics and physics . with correa as head of the department , he led research that resulted in the measurement of the amplitude of electric discharges , through over the colliding contacts on ferromagnetic quartz crystals . in 1906 corra discovered the corra force , a counter-intuitive effect that clearly accounts for the corra effect and was the first to establish a direct relationship between the intensity of an electric current and the contact size of the crystal . also , in 1906 , corra showed that this force does not depend on the diameter of the crystal , nor on the strength of the contact with a surface . in addition , corra found the prototype image projector during this time , also called `` corra sheet `` , which remained in use for many years .
corra also contributed to the development of the metric system.corra worked in one of correa 's ph.d. departmental laboratories at the university of milan and as an assistant in leopoldina 's physics department . his early work was dedicated to optical quantum mechanics , which led him to the discovery of the corra effect and the maxwell–zirkel effect . in 1910 corra became an assistant professor in rome , italy , where he continued to take important direct part in student work and in world war i . he then moved to america where he taught mathematics and physics to employees at the universities of colorado and yale.at the institute for optics in bologna , corra identified the reactance of electrical resistances that acted upon plates of superconducting material . in 1916 he showed that a voltage drop in a superconductor provided a significant component of the corra effect . from 1918 until his death , corra worked in the metallurgical laboratory at the university of bologna , where he was one of the founders of the new department of physics and quantum mechanics . he also received an honorary doctorate in 1954 from the university of padova . his scientific achievements are known in multiple media . since 1937 , he has been an editor of a number of scientific journals .


== legacy ==
corra 's reputation is held with the name corra iron , and his important contributions in the physics of superconductivity are still relatively few and fundamental today . corra was well known in physics education and he was instrumental in recruiting and retaining young graduate students . his achievements are complemented by his legendary students . among them were physicist vittorio sagme . the bronze statue of corra in the university of bologna 's institute for optical materials in pisa and the academic streets of rome are named after him.he was active in scientific societies , and he was elected as president of the italian association for scientific research and the scientific committee on physics .

jensen was born in portland , oregon . his father owned a small soap factory and early schooling was poorly attended . he got into homeopathic medicine , graduating in 1922 . in 1927 , he left homeopathic medicine to go to columbia university . a research assistant there , bernice la salle , introduced him to genetics and vaccination . in 1924 , jensen joined the somerville institute in new york city , working with joan greer , in collaboration with scientist albert hoffman .
in 1935 , jensen and greer developed the peptide virus a . from 1947 to 1953 , he was the distinguished professor of genetics at columbia university .
after retirement , jensen continued to collaborate with other researchers and the bundestag in their efforts to develop polio vaccines , and was an early advocate for the laboratory-based treatment of children with polio . in 1955 , the institute he founded , which he called genetics laboratory of the american association for the advancement of science , was renamed the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases.in the late 1940s , after receiving a grant from the rockefeller foundation , he went to work at the rockefeller institute for medical research ( now the rockefeller university ) in new york city on the study of bacteria , viruses and other emerging infectious agents . jensen was the head of the laboratory , which he left with the institute in 1946 to focus on radiation-induced mutations of genes that appeared in bacteria . in 1948 , he received the diamant chabard chair in viral biology at the rockefeller institute .
in 1951 , jensen 's research group performed the first direct sequencing of the influenza virus . this `` faseb-x `` program was the first time that a large database of microorganisms , viruses and genes was used to build the human immunodeficiency virus vaccine . also in 1951 , in collaboration with charles trumbull , he proposed an integrated design of the abc virus assay to allow for the detection of as yet untested inactivated antibodies . the vaccination trial known as the vaccine trial of 1955 demonstrated that the vaccine had virus effectiveness over the time period of about 4 years . jensen began working at the rockefeller institute as a visiting scholar , and later the director , in 1957 . during this period , he also published a paper titled , `` the replication of the h5n1 b virus `` ( `` daily life of an aerobic hemagglutinin-steroid `` ) . in 1954 , he published on how infectious bacteria ( h5n1 ) polysaccharide glycoprotein ( gs ) can infect nerve cells . jensen 's findings led to the discovery that csf droplets could contain pathogens that elicit a rabies bite in the mouse , and this research helped inform the isolation of the virus from blood and saliva of some experimental experimental rabies virus carriers . he had pioneered efforts to find genes involved in generating and directing h5n1 infection and helped pioneer the vaccine.in 1955 , jensen went to work at massachusetts general hospital where he was president of the national advisory committee for immunization and infectious disease . in 1961 , he became a full-time associate professor at the rockefeller institute and held the same position until his retirement in 1985 .

= wilhelm gustav goldschmidt =
werner gustav goldschmidt ( september 13 , 1903 – february 8 , 1985 ) was a german physicist and early impact scientist .
he was an influential figure in the research of astrophysics , especially after it was recognised that the milky way was just one variable in the cosmic photograph used by edwin hubble . goldschmidt is regarded as one of the founders of cosmology , and was a leading expert in the study of stellar characteristics and our cosmic environment . he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1974 for his role in the development of the cosmic spectrum interpretation of the hubble picture of the galaxy .
goldschmidt died in the early afternoon of february 8 , 1985 , in heidelberg .


== life ==
wilhelm gustav goldschmidt was born on september 13 , 1903 , in the small village of gävle , kiel . his father , hans goldschmidt , had been a pharmacist in lehfeldtau and kiel . his mother , claudia goldschmidt , was a professor of physics at the university of gütersloh . he was a member of the christian social union ( csu ) , and was an active member of the kössche mission . in 1929 he graduated from the university of kiel with a first-class degree in chemistry .
goldschmidt 's mother died when he was eight . he took over the education of his brothers , herbert goldschmidt and werner . werner became a soldier and became a government worker , while herbert was a political activist and a jew . werner , and herbert , respectively , both went to east germany in 1938 to escape the nazi occupation . goldschmidt took part in the kössche mission in angola .
in 1943 he was drafted into the german army , and subsequently joined the science corps . the mission conducted a solar eclipse in 1944 , and was among the first to witness what was regarded at the time as a solar eruption . goldschmidt stayed in the german army , where he participated in the invasions of austria and poland . he was stationed at uytte at wättemberg , where his most famous colleague was august schwannberg .


== career ==
from 1943 to 1953 , goldschmidt held positions at the laboratories of the universities of kiel , munich and göttingen . he did important research in the use of space-time variables . his major achievement was the identification of a relationship between stellar position and a magnitude of cosmic radiation . the relationship formed is so important , that goldschmidt is sometimes referred to as the father of astronomical cosmology . goldschmidt established the space-time picture of the milky way in 1953 , and his investigations of stellar characteristics led to the development of cosmological equations . goldschmidt also performed major work on photographic interpretation of the hubble picture , through the use of cosmic data . he was one of the first to discover the rotation patterns of stars . goldschmidt completed the development of the cosmic spectrum interpretation of the hubble picture of the galaxy , taking the opportunity to observe `` earthquakes `` caused by the passing of hot magnetic fields across the sky . goldschmidt 's original idea on the origin of these was that they were created by nearby heavy elements ejected in outer space , and that they then entered the star and slowly dispersed in their course . after his discovery of the true source of the gravitational effects of nuclear explosions , goldschmidt 's theory about the formation of the solar wind was accepted by other astronomers and cosmologists , and is still known today as goldschmidt 's hypothesis . his law was proved experimentally by ivan sutherland and colleagues , and in 1995 university of california , los angeles , physicist william coleman theodor koch credited him with one of the first predictions of the cosmic microwave background radiation .
goldschmidt died at his home in heidelberg .

dyer wrote a sentence on the emancipation of slaves in liberia ( freedoms press , 1948 ) . dyer acknowledged that , because of the great depression , widespread child marriage was in fact common , but argued that among the population at large child marriage was unusual . he believed that the best way to end child marriage was through the government-funded birth control funds.dyer advocated the `` liberation of women from slavery and sexual slavery `` , as well as `` free education and free health care for all `` , using child marriage as a means to achieve these goals.he opposed the compulsory sterilization of children , and argued that the unethical practice was morally damaging . in 1948 dyer was quoted as saying : `` … there was never any doubt that women were slaves to men , that they were tools whose use it was their own . 'equal pay for equal work ' ... can never apply to women and children . i want to raise the old age of consent for the u.s. to eight . i want to raise the age of consent for the 50 states to at least sixteen. `` dyer believed that child marriage violated human rights and `` is , by definition , unnatural and not to be tolerated. ``

= vilfredo pareto =
vilfredo pareto ( april 21 , 1875 in piacenza – february 15 , 1960 ) was an italian biologist . he is best known for his comparative studies of the process of evolution . his work in biology developed from his own collection of material , to the works of these men , . in particular , he showed that mutations in the algal species of lambda-antorals , permethrin , neutrophil , pectin and striata , which he had previously described in his own right , , were also responsible for their respective innovations in the algal kingdom . these substitutions resulted in the formation of new groups and phyla . an example of this was the heterotrophic genera liolaemus and liolaemorpha . subsequent species of stellate alga were also called by pareto : sparta or spatholite , colegio , canaria and spati .


== life ==
pareto was born in piacenza , italy , the son of a member of the piacenza chamber of commerce . he then studied at the ecole de france and university of padua , obtaining his ph.d. in 1885 . during the first years of his professional career he devoted much time to the publication of scientific articles in the field of his specialty , evolution , for which he became professor at padua university in 1887 . in addition to his scientific contributions to this specialty , pareto served as an administrator at the pontifical catholic university of rome , as well as being rector of that institution . he was also responsible for the prefect of the pontifical athenaeum , of which he served as president until his death .
his works in biology were wide-ranging : he published a vast series of works on the herpetology of italy , and on the taxonomy of the bryozoans , in 1887–1890 , and in 1897–1902 published a book on coral evolution . in addition to his work on evolution , pareto made several contributions to the field of paleobiology and described a number of new genera and species of insect , such as the bryozoans proseta and sesi , and the stellate hyphlaena . pareto 's contribution to the genus helix was no less important than his study of the relative numbers and forms of the several species in that genus .

mariano gazzaniga ( october 24 , 1881 – january 8 , 1966 ) was an italian scientist and politician , founder of the sociologia cimentale di evoluzione cimentale dei campini . he was in charge of the national science association of italian students in monterey from 1940 to 1943 .


== early life and education ==
gazzaniga was born in ferrara in 1881 . his family was devout roman catholics . his father , antonello gazzaniga , had a brother named paolo gazzaniga . he studied chemistry at the university of ferrara , in 1904 and in 1910 graduated with a degree in botany . he later went to university in rome , where he met patricio colombo and marcello ippolito.gazzaniga earned his doctorate in physics under the direction of prof. carlo gide in alcalá . gide was the author of several books on theoretical physics and has been credited with the development of the concept of the higgs boson .


== career ==
in the course of his career , he participated in numerous physical science experiments of which several papers were submitted to the prestigious italian scientific journal nature . in 1918 , he wrote a paper with a colleague , in which they presented the results of a hydrostatic experimental mission to the casimir sphere at hertz . this was followed by the discovery of what became known as the `` echelon of gattini crater `` in 1929 . he was one of the founders of the sociologia cimentale di evoluzione cimentale dei campini and later chair of sociology at the city of monterey .
in 1940 , gazzaniga became chief of the department of electricity , gas and industry , of the federal ministry of the interior . he succeeded ernesto gatti , another classic italian scientist , in the president of the royal college of science in rome , succeeding as president in 1942 . during his tenure , the power in monterey was significantly decreased , since most students of the city were not interested in modern technology . in addition , gazzaniga attempted to introduce a politically correct curriculum for physics , changing it to pernilism .


== scientific contributions ==
gazzaniga is considered as the founder of `` modern physics `` in italy . he defined the new phenomenon of superfluidity as follows :
... the chemical formula of a superfluid liquid or gas , and is applied to the superfluid gas at lower temperatures , just as to a gas of flame .
gazzaniga formulated this property through the chemical properties of non-equilibrium fluids . in later years he was able to prove the existence of metallic fissures with electrons similar to those present in metals . he also used the term sub-fluidity . in 1894 , he introduced to italian scientific literature the knowledge of a rare isotope of uranium that had been discovered in 1902 by casimir platon , showing that metals are not solid . he also co-authored the text triumvirate ( trio ) with aldo cadmium . gazzaniga died in monterey in 1966 .

hans siegfried barnhart ( 26 september 1833 in wimpole – 16 may 1901 in salzburg ) was a german theologian . he was a professor at the university of salzburg from 1874 to 1878 . he was especially associated with the knowledge of deuteronomy and the new testament . he authored a hebrew edition of the old testament .
barnhart was one of the first important theological commentators in the field of neo-lutheranism , which he considered more established than modern protestantism.barnhart 's name is associated with the more popular episcopate of christian calvinists . this denomination was founded in 1792 by his fellow lutheran theologian ernst gröttl . in this church and sect the episcopal see was the only one of its kind in the whole of germany.the anglican bishop of mainz , tobias schopenhauer , gave barnhart the care of his second visit in 1849 . this consisted of three years and a half and involved four churches in mainz , two of them in heidelberg , and seven months in england . he undertook , among other things , the preparation of an edition of the gospels in latin and english . he was accompanied by a lecturer on deuteronomy , a book on the works of st. paul , a translation of st. james , a work on the gospels in the new testament and a treatise on the new testament of paul .
the bishop of mainz had , after his father 's death , inherited the family home and spare time . the reason for barnhart 's exertions , was that no attention had been paid to this naturalization law since 1840 , but a law so recently forgotten was still being enforced . in 1870 the whole family moved to hamburg , where they lodged for a year . two years later the new jerusalem synagogue was organized . barnhart studied theology at the university of tübingen , in 1876 he received his licentiate ( doctorate ) in philosophy , being ordained the same year . his ordination showed that he was one of the few authors of intellectual writing in germany that made an effort to reconcile the religious and social outlook of the 19th century .

in 1822 , he was appointed assistant in the garden of trinity college , oxford , and with thomas stafford died in 1833 . in 1833 he was elected a fellow of the royal society . his work on the root system of certain plant species inspired a description by dr. huxley of the spicelia neroliopsis opercularis in 1836 , and in the same year became one of the first subscribers to new naturalist ( now puffin ) magazine .
he died at whittington hall , near grove hall , london .


== works ==
william was especially interested in the alpine plants . in 1834 , while living at trelawny he published “ an account of some recent wanderings from the dolomites to the kew gardens , london , by a young officer in the royal artillery , under mr. joseph billi , major of brigade 22 ( officers'royal artillery , light artillery ) , whilst in the french river on patrol , out of the view of the french government and many other high gentlemen who know not how to deal with a scientist like myself who can not speak french `` ( i.e. , bagnall-mansfield 's the danubian alps ) . he also wrote :

`` the butterfly ’ s most important scapeclets are found in france , in large part due to the irregular crossing of the gulf of cambrai from the west to the north , so as to form the often extinct seine . both the latter , as well as the fall of the alps in the course of the battle , produced a terror on those parts where those crags are already seen , and consequently on the inhabitants of a coastal district , so that it was almost impossible for the soldiers who crossed them to get home , or to repose ... an army of the napoleonic directory should explore the almost endless riesenschaffen of france , with as much delight and research as i shall . `` he also wrote on the botanical garden at trelawny :

`` some inquiries are worthy of notice in connection with that garden at trelawny , and relate to the possession and cultivation of various plants , on a large scale , and in large numbers . the quantities of plants . `` in 1838 robinson wrote :
`` i am now in my seventies , and am thinking of a comparative system of botany , together with a description of some new species of mushrooms ; and in passing , i shall interpose some curious remarks respecting the law of conformation of the boundaries between plants , as applied to tropical diseases , which is expressed in ‘ paternal decomposition ’ of the plants . as a curious conjecture i give ‘ interposition ’ of species at the partition of a plant into regular torsion plates ; and may the author of ‘ the real english stork ’ use ’ the same phrase for the american spiny stringfoot . it is probable , also , that ‘ new jamaican `` which i do not recall seeing , is the same species as a species of new zealand mygalomorph ( schulina sive beninger ) ; and this idea is supported by dr. ruse ’ s trip to the pitcairn islands in 1832 , and by dr. charles curzon 's account in the encyclopædia britannica in 1799 , ‘ entomology ; or , an enquiry into the origin of insects , and their evidences , ’ and by the eponymous annals of linnaeus . ’

=== kuiper belt ===
webb devised an ingenious method of calculating the distance of the farthest point on the far side of the asteroid vesta from earth.hubble was amongst the early astronomers to discover the hypothetical structure of the giant planet kuiper belt , located in the outermost portion of the kuiper belt.in 1803 , webb saw that a star would not `` rise `` from the lower surface of the planet because it would `` travel `` to the upper hemisphere of the planet , at a speed of more than 23,000 kilometers per second ( 18,099 miles per second ) . with this in mind he suggested that the path of the star should be curved to match this speed.he arrived at a calculation of a star 's orbital period of 5 years and 36 days , which he presented to the royal astronomical society , based on observations made with the kepler telescope in 1636 . the results were published in a paper of 5 june 1802 . on 2 july 1803 , webb was chosen to succeed william herschel as chairman of the newly founded royal astronomical society .
his best known work was on the solar eclipse of 1776 , which he observed for the first time on 24 january 1811 . he failed to predict the eclipse , and was unaware that herschel had recently observed an eclipse.he was a member of many scientific societies , including the royal society of edinburgh , the royal society of london , the astronomical society of london , and the royal society of paris .

he described the structure and mycology of the staphylococci and the theory of lysis . a list of a number of his publications appears in the w.m.sc . book microbiology in 1919 ( foresman 's monograph ) and in the mycologist ’ s dictionary 1927 .
he established the antibiotics sequence study in 1918 and worked with john napier wylie to publish the manual of microbiology in 1922 .


== work ==
guilfoyle worked on the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis , which was an equally important problem of disease control . he was also interested in tuberculosis and was elected a member of the all-party commission on tuberculosis . he was particularly interested in the differentiation of pathogenic myc organisms , which was essential for assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of tuberculosis.his best-known contribution was the theory of lysis , which defined the technique of quantifying the extent of cytological damage to the cytoskeleton and performed the distinction between dermal ( vesicular ) and epidermis mycoplasma ( nerve cells ) . in his theory he used the criteria of rhodopsin and the reaction time of mycoplasmas to distinguish particular stages of elimination .
guilfoyle showed that infection of mycoplasma was normal . the treatment of baphid ( pneumococcal eye infection ) with hydrogen peroxide is so effective in the treatment of the disease .

during world war i , patterson began working on a research group on the growth of coal . the ross valley area in central and south ohio was little known , so he assembled a staff , including william d. kelley and pat burrows , to study the geology of the area . they laid out hundreds of square miles of field equipment . patterson discovered extensive deposits of olivine and graphite deposits in the basin . he also discovered new ore deposits , including those rich in rare elements such as cerium . the research group went on to study large geological fields in wyoming and montana , and in mexico.while researching geology , the patterson-kelley group also attempted to mine ore deposits near an existing coal pipeline . the route went through the davis , utah and clark counties in northern arizona and ran through the bund county towns of wheat ridge and kansas city , missouri , until it crossed through snelling county , missouri , on the gallatin river in porter county . there , the group found a new vein of olivine , cerium and bismuth deposits . it is estimated that over 2 million tons of ore ( pure and ore processed ) were produced at least as early as 1911 . the paper completed by the patterson-kelley team was published in the american journal of science and engineering in 1924 . patterson was one of the first professional engineers to describe the ore deposits , identifying those with its earth tones . their standard of differentiation is higher quality than what is available today .
in a separate study , the patterson group found a new mine in northern california , but its geology was much more complicated . the mine , which is known as diebold creek , was named pat patterson mine after him .

in 1971 , landry published the landmark landry research in human activity . he and colleagues used brain lesions to show that people can rapidly and predictably move their brains into new locations . the first detailed images of the brain showed how different parts of the brain reacted when they were touched in specific locations .
the landry model was described and named for a brain region , called the neocortex , that develops in response to the human body . neuroscientists robert landry , bruce r. walter , and donald j. landry described landry 's model in human behavior ( first published in 1987 ) . the landry model is a programmable computational model that promotes prediction of behaviors . the goal of the model is to capture every type of behavior by locating the position and amplitude of neuronal events that can induce the behavior in advance .


== legacy ==
landry is recognized for his pioneering work in the experimental neuroanatomy . with the assistance of joseph l. schwartz , he wrote and published on the function of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.he contributed to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological conditions including alzheimer 's disease .

== early life ==
william gerstle was born on 13 august 1842 in mecklenburg , upper silesia ( today-poland ) , in the silesian region of the upper silesian and ussuriut ( now wrocław ) empire . in 1874 , he graduated from high school and started his studies at the university in mecklenburg . he later worked in the mineralogical department at the technical and governmental institute at the same university , but in 1879 started an investigation at high school about the peculiar formation of old gypsum deposits in poland and the upper silesian region.he was hired by lawrence livermore laboratory ( known today as livermore national laboratory ) as an assistant in 1910 and in 1916 became director of the geological surveys of that department . in 1918 he became a career lecturer in geology at union college in columbia , new york . in 1923 , he became a principal of union college , and in 1937 became a full professor .


== scientific activities ==
the many scientific papers published during his lifetime contain the results of scientific investigations around the world . most of the researches by gerstle were very similar to the one which walter curran published during the same period , but with the details being a little different . gerstle used different methods . as a result , some of the results published after 1923 and only after gerstle 's death have been very unfavorable to curran and many conclusions have come to confirm it . gerstle 's colleague , victor kemeny , did much to inform these negative results , and also to spread the scientific opinions about gypsum 's antiquity through general statements , due to the popularity of scientific research around the world .
gerstle was co-author of specimen geology and ( 1903 ) natural geology of the alaskan arctic . he was co-author of popular geology and ( 1904 ) complete geology , in collaboration with dr. george davis.his investigations are found in his books beiträge zur kenntnis der fischen aufschnitte riespen und gluverschen ozean . w. gerstle ( lxxii + 1 ; stuttgart , 1913 ) .

= alexander dubsky =
alexander dubsky ( 18 april 1753 – 11 march 1832 ) was a russian russian statesman , mathematician , physicist , writer and scientist .


== life ==
dubsky was born at kolmenka . in his youth he studied mathematics and astronomy at moscow university and at saint petersburg military academy , obtaining his doctorate at saint petersburg in 1774 . he was not employed during the revolution , but afterwards became a lecturer at saint petersburg military academy . in 1793 he became the first vice-rector of the institute of the propagation of learning . in 1796 he became a member of the international mathematical society .
during the revolution , dubsky was among those who advocated free trade , but lost his seat at the institute of the propagation of learning and was banned for three years from going to paris and other european capitals . he then returned to russia , where he became the chairman of the russian library in paris . his work brought him recognition throughout russia , and during the russian revolution he became its deputy to the imperial government , which is thought to have favored him and others with the patronage of the prussian government .


== scientific work ==
dubsky is considered the father of mathematical physics . his main research interest was the relations between two potentials of infinite curvature , v and f , and their vector product with the same degree , m. it has been argued that he wrote the first mathematical treatise on linear equations , a work that is known as leopold ( 1795 ) , which has influenced many modern mathematicians . the solution to the leopold equation has three solutions : m=2/m , f=1/2 , and v=1/4 . the author did not assume a uniform distribution of the variables but he allowed for their properties .
dubsky introduced the idea of simultaneous dualities that can be expressed as elementary numbers , analogous to the dirac integral . the book of syllogism began this work . later , dubsky solved the elliptic curves from 5:2:3 and from 3:2 :2 :4 by starting from 4 and ending from 3 . he was not a prolific inventor and did not publish many works .


== published works ==
on the planets


=== discoverer ===
as noted in l'école romanistique , the mention of the hebrew name יהוה לאבודה האמר אשרים ( maklimas pachonoboy ) in russian literature is a complete misspelling . it has now been proven that this manuscript ( 19 july 1794 , from korczak under the influence of aleksandr milov ) was not a librievo manuscript but one of dubsky 's own work .

humphrey spruce ( may 23 , 1887 – march 1 , 1958 ) was a british physician and geneticist who became the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg . he demonstrated that recombination between two chromosomes was possible , thus establishing a link between cross-sex chromosomes and normal biology.spruce was born in bournemouth , england , and educated at birkbeck college , london . he obtained his phd in 1909 from the university of cambridge , where he lectured on plant physiology . he was awarded the arnold owen prize in 1930 , the edgar b. evans prize in 1936 , and the arnold c. spruce medal in 1932 . the edward avery memorial medal of the american society of plant pathologists is named in his honor .
spruce later worked in the institute of medical genetics at the british medical research council . he was elected president of the royal society of medicine in 1937 . his papers on japanese measles were published in american journals . he published over 120 scientific papers and received many honors , including the robert f. reed foundation prize .
his research mainly focused on the genetics of viruses . he suggested that certain variants of the influenza virus were inherited from several women , but his research of venereal diseases did not establish this . nevertheless , he was the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg , while others have since verified the basis of this finding .
spruce described 11 different herpesviruses , and it is estimated that he identified 46 million different forms of these viruses . he is remembered as a scientific pioneer because he showed that two of the four `` biological girls `` of the zaire epidemic of 1918 , sars or west nile ( two subspecies of the sars ) were genetically distinct ; however , it was only by isolating the e4 segment of that virus that he was able to establish the exact sequence of its rna content .

in the early 1950s kraig also began to research in axial torsion , applied matrices , elastic scattering and even the lattice field theory of crystals . his research led to the development of the ultrashort-width laser matrix and also enhanced the production of thin films by means of an extended nuclear crystal ( a so-called vortex blockade ) . the model formed in 1952 is the blueprint used for the k-nuclei used in many today 's modern spectroscopes and the so-called energy hysteresis rhopalo.kraig was a member of the institute of near-infrared studies ( irios ) of the soviet academy of sciences . he was awarded the hero of socialist labor in 1955 . he received the physicist medal in 1958 and the order of the red banner of labour in 1960 .
in the 1960s and 1970s , kraig did research at the institute for near-infrared studies in the leningrad meteorological facility . from 1984 to 1987 , kraig was the head of the department of applied physics of moscow state university , which produced the renowned k-nuclei and became the leading institute in the country in physics and metallurgy.kraig joined the ussr academy of sciences in 1963 as a scientific officer and in 1973 was named a member of the peasant 's party of the ussr . on the recommendation of yuri andreev , he was elected to the soviet academy of sciences in the 1980s.kraig was one of the first to apply superconductivity to thermal treatment of matter . he was a founder and the head of the research group for superconductivity and an early contributor to the development of the wpc ( wire thin-film method ) .
he died on july 28 , 1998 , in saint petersburg from heart failure at the age of 57 .

= joseph warren ( physicist ) =
joseph warren ( march 23 , 1869 – june 11 , 1942 ) was an american mathematician , electrical engineer , and philanthropist .


== biography ==
warren graduated from harvard in 1891 and was a post-graduate student there in the summer of 1895 . he worked under carl van vechten , and in the following year was awarded the weinberg prize , which he had been given for a statistical proof that the first-order functions of polynomials are continuous . he stayed on at harvard for his final year , graduating with a m.a . in mathematics in 1913 .
warren joined general electric in 1917 and became chief engineer in 1923 . in the late 1920s he became a major figure in the developing field of crystal theory , with an early contribution to the field of subharmonic theory . in the 1930s he pursued large-scale magnetic surfaces with as-yet-unproven evidence of dislocations in the crystals they sit on . in 1932 he proposed a framework for classifying crystals based on surface properties . warren , along with john asphale and samuel bushnell , coined the terms `` magnetic lattice `` and `` antiferromagnetism `` .
warren died in boston , massachusetts in 1942 .


== education ==
warren attended the high school for gifted children of charles t. foster in lexington , massachusetts , and graduated from king 's college london in 1904 .


== scientific work ==
in 1912 he joined the harvard group investigating the interplay of physics and chemistry under dr. carl van vechten . there warren began to use a statistical model to measure what happens to crystals with magnetic fields . in 1913 he developed and published a method of classifying crystals based on surface properties , which ultimately led to a mathematical theory known as the warren-von-neumann theory . he first proposed a subharmonic theory of the ferromagnetism of ferroelectric crystals in 1931 . the model is still being tested as a rigorous mathematical framework for studying crystals , but it is now the basis for a new group of methods including , for example , the elimination method .
he worked on the electric and magnetic properties of polymers . warren developed the term `` hyperfine structure `` for hard materials that have conformational constants low enough to be measured at a wavelength that a certain surface area can be reached by the index or axial-line method , which relies on detecting all the only possible hyperfine structures in a collection of materials.for most of his career , warren worked with general electric and western electric.in the late 1920s and early 1930s he published papers on the derivation of differential equations for elementary crystals .
warren also performed a number of mathematical work on ion transport and the electron and positron exchange of hygroscopic and polymeric compounds.warren was elected president of the american mathematical society in 1925 .

== biography ==
arthur turrell was born in wentworth , manchester on 28 october 1859 . the family moved to milton keynes in 1865 , and he and his brother andrew spent most of the remainder of their lives there . as a young man he was a keen amateur photographer , and he bought , and painted , a series of portraits of himself as a young boy , which became famous , and became a best-seller . in 1887 , turrell edited and published an edition of a 12th-century botanical work on polderrads by richard bradley , sometimes called the bradley catalogue of plants , from cambria to gibraltar.he was the son of physician samuel turrell , and father of the anglican clergyman and botanist arthur turrell . turrell was the grandfather of the english atheist david turrell .
he lived in reading from his middle age to his death .


== views ==
arthur turrell was a strict calvinist with views on abortion and abortion practices , but his views changed to support church dogma in all areas of life . turrell was a specialist in this branch of christianity , and he was by far the most extensive of the theologians advocating their policy . he believed that the bible contains all the laws of nature , and that the church was able to conclusively uphold those laws with absolute certitude . therefore , he supported the party which tended to establish the strongest doctrines in the modern sense ( puritanism ) .
as such , he said that scripture contains no opinion on women , only on men , and all men are created equal . he stressed the scientific aspects of scripture in his writings , insisting on the general validity of the bible , even of the canonical ones , with the exception of abraham and isaac . he felt that christianity needed to accept many revisions , which are usually necessary to update doctrine as new evidence comes to light . he strongly objected to marriage , especially for unmarried men . he was very disappointed with secular culture of the time , and believed that it was largely the world around him and the world around him in general that failed him , instead of his own views .

henrik fischler ( 30 december 1862 – 5 september 1934 ) was a swedish physiologist and scientist . he is best known for his publications on comparative physiology , especially for his work on the cellular complexity of the skin . in 1882 he founded the centre for experimental investigation of the brain at the karolinska institute in stockholm . he then led experiments to determine whether pigment and other proteins can cause tissues to degenerate by affecting their specific states .
he was the first to show the contribution of proteins to the theory of glycogen-peroxidation in contrast to calcium-dependent oxygen metabolism and the storage of energy in the liver , where in contrast to cyanogen it is located .


== biography ==
henrik fischler was born in uppsala in 1862 . he obtained his medical doctorate in 1893 from the university of uppsala , where in 1899 he was awarded a chair of physiology in genetics and pathology . he was later a senior lecturer at the karolinska institutet and in 1900–1903 head of its department of pathology . from 1899 until 1905 he held the chair of zoology at the university of stockholm . he was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1918 . he died in 1934 in stockholm .
fischler developed several new diseases , in particular cerebral amyloidosis . his research on insulin resistance led him to hypothesize that vitamin b12 is a problem . in 1910 he demonstrated that the splenocyte mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for insulin-resistant skeletal muscle , which is an early discovery that also contributed to subsequent advances in kidney function .

== early life and education ==
c3 a1c sédémar was born on february 3 , 1891 in paris and attended the école des métiers . in 1898 , while still a student at école des métiers , he received a `` gérard thesis `` , which he kept from 1903 to 1904 . sédémar began his lectures with a lecture `` méthodologie des minerals d'aluminium `` ( an introduction to mineralogy ) , which was published in 1908 . the following year , he published a book on the history of the aluminum industry , entitled `` le process d'aluminium `` ( process of aluminum ) . in 1914 he published a history of the aluminum industry .


== professional activities ==
in 1906 sédémar and his teacher françois blanchard wrote the refining of aluminum ore from copper and magnetite , their first published paper , published in french . they developed the processes of plane and cylinder melting in the 1923 refining of aluminum ore from copper and magnetite and filed the proposal to set up the c. roseau leroy hospital at dubuisson in 1907 . in the next four years sédémar refined the process of aluminium melting into a small metal by using sandstone and natural iron . he then developed a process for steel production based on the steel-producing process used by richard debrandt of roseau-leroy in 1893 . cement production took a back seat in 1910 to the process of metal refining , as well as to the operations of the new hospital and the process of refining minerals .

in 1925 sédémar became director of the école des métiers at the école royale des mines de villeneuve . he played an important role in the international tin industry , having coined the term `` smelting `` for the process of producing and refining the small metal known as smelted tin.in 1929 , while in hospital in paris , he developed laminar flow , but was eventually pressured to discontinue it because of too much fatigue caused by repeated grinding .

== early life ==
thomas was born on 14 september 1818 , son of timothy and mary ann franklin . he attended shoreham school , later being known as isleworth . he took a keen interest in chemistry and was elected as an alternate at the local polytechnic , which in turn encouraged his interests .


== career ==
in 1836 , after studying for a year at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge , he accepted a job as part of a prominent family business , that of consulting firm `` edward burton `` , run by his father , which was later amalgamated to create the fisher & warner company . the firm made improvements to local service throughout the east riding of yorkshire , which then came under federal government . william morgan fisher , another employee of edward burton , became the company 's general manager in 1851 and created the fisher & warner estate to house his firm 's operations in the local area . at the time , edward 's wealth and influence secured him wide access to government .


== teaching career ==
in 1847 , franklin began teaching chemistry at bury st edmunds and graduated in 1850 . he was promoted to head chemistry teacher at the school , initially to balliol college but later to st thomas'school , in hackney , which had become an early model for the university of cambridge . he was also appointed head of his old school , north staffordshire school of pharmacy , which he continued to teach until his retirement in 1880 . franklin kept a keen interest in science from an early age and encouraged the use of apparatus that improved the efficiency and safety of both chemical and mechanical research . he wrote many reports on various subjects , including chemistry and a chemical microscope.beginning in 1863 , franklin had his new school open to the public and encouraged new pupils and visitors to join the school for social purposes . in 1868 , students and staff were building the first building to house the main laboratory of the geological survey , in hyde park , which is now the edward franklin laboratory at the university of cambridge . that year , he married mary steyn , a schoolmistress . their children included :
mary grainger franklin ( 1864–1887 ) and douglas franklin ( 1866–1929 ) .douglas was a friend of professor william watson in the university of bristol , and the two had a successful partnership when franklin left in 1882 . they had two children , alice and robert :


== medical career ==
the publication of dr. agar 's conjugate of nitrate , which he first published in 1874 , improved the technique of mycological and microbiological research and provided a new route for mycologists to investigate the nature of mycological species and how they differed from one another . the discovery of cyanomyces yeast ( agar 's coal ) provided support for a broad-spectrum treatment of carbapenems and other fungi , which was illustrated by the discovery of cryptogamic fungi , such as rhododendron cryptogamicum and vesicularia junius .


== publications ==
dr. franklin wrote and published more than 250 papers and reviews , including investigations into the bacterial lipases , microflora and cytology of coal mines , the occurrence of cyanomyces fungal spores in oil wells , and several types of fungi . he was a primary author of several leading monographs , as well as numerous co-authored journal articles , and he contributed to the united states national library of medicine and the proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh . his report on the hard science of yeast cells is widely considered a classic in this field . his earlier papers on fungus discovered by the miner alfred rose under the united states system of mineral deposits were for more than half a century the definitive source for the broad scientific discussion of the fungi that inhabit underground rock basins.the mineral and botanical names of crystals found in several valleys in british india include :

== works ==
the flora of ireland ( 1840 ) is the first of schultze 's books to publish with plates . in the pages of this book , he continues the study and identification of many native plants and illustrations are clear and easy to understand . schultze illustrated the flora of ireland with over one hundred plates that contain up to ninety thousand different plant species . one of his best-known designs was a giant atlas with a grid system . its 40 cm ( 12 inch ) high thickness is unusually tall for a book . the atlas would cover an acre of land . the grid system is implemented here with rows of identical grid tiles for each species , and the grid included six species in each row . a beetle with eight rows of green would match with the plants for the second row of the new planting . as the book has to print so many green plants , each row contains eight green leaf forms which has to be arranged according to the grid into rows of new plants , in the table of `` leaf forms `` below . the column of green forms would be rotated by 180 degrees and the character `` a `` in the sheet for the genus would be set to line up with the next new plant for that species.in addition to the flora of ireland , schultze illustrated about 70 other books . he also published at least two historical and archaeological books , journey to ireland ( 1851 ) and tree plants in ireland . an american citizen in ireland ( 1854 ) was the oldest irish-language historical narrative by an american , published in the us in 1825.when schultze died , his wife , a laywoman , inherited the family fortune . he had written his chief work flora of ireland in his will shortly before his death.schultze also translated into english by others flora de nilcarne : la reine ( 1845 ) by gaetano mocenigo , paracelsus ( 1845 ) by george siebersbach and flora de bretagne ( 1848 ) by jean d'anville . he published the seven volumes of the flora de bretagne in 1850 and the four volumes of the paracelsus in 1852 .
the `` leaf forms `` section in the latter book is named for the growths of mallow and rose plants on which schultze drew and numbered .

joel spence leibovitz ( 17 december 1836 – 26 may 1918 ) was a british eugenicist and one of the founders of the american eugenics movement .


== life and work ==
leibovitz was born at methuen in surrey , and came to england in 1844 . he went on to study under william herschel , a leading harvard professor of comparative psychology , and worked as an assistant to horace penrose . in 1861 , at the instigation of a friend , he produced the famed leibovitz–penrose testing bible . this was a complete list of every exam , and was supposedly designed to show the size of difference that could be observed between persons of different race .
in 1865 , he was promoted to lecturer , and , by 1868 , to lecturer and head of the department of education at the bristol academy . in 1868 , he helped to establish the general anthropological institute in london.leibovitz was a member of the eugenics society of great britain , and served as the society 's president from 1865 to 1869 .
in 1878 he married emily galloway ( 1807–1914 ) , a school teacher . his papers include entries in biographical journals , including the bristol women 's journal and st. thomas 's monthly journal of natural philosophy , and he also collaborated with walter briggs , the head of the american social science association .


== criticism and legacy ==
samuel bernard meyer , in his description of leibovitz 's work , compared the curriculum of british education to that of the third reich , under the doctrine that `` a thorough knowledge of history is the most important of all the essential prerequisites `` .
the american eugenics society , founded in 1918 , has made it an explicit policy not to accept nominations for fellowships from jewish and christian leaders . the conservative alliance describes this statement as an `` international betrayal of british ethnic principles , siding with the nazis over british men of good will and decency `` .paul ehrlich , who used to lead the michigan eugenics society , wrote in 1918 : `` very few among the leading professional minds of britain had regard to the potentially disastrous consequences to their own work if the relationship became troubled . `` in 1879 , leibovitz published his second system of psychology , a study of the psychology of race . according to richard lewontin , this examination of the psychology of race was the foundation for the later study of `` mental pathology `` , the theory that all groups were mentally similar .
a change in eugenics policies has been apparent since his death , with less focus on ascertaining mental health of the general public . in 2012 , a group called the act of eugenics committee decided to focus instead on turning back the tide on the expansion of artificial contraception .

bellinghausen was born in amsterdam . after a thorough study of science , he completed his medical degree from the free university of brussels , and began his career as an experimental pathologist , developing an interest in the effects of alcohols and pesticides . he conducted research at the university of liège under the supervision of hermann von helmholtz . bellinghausen received the british royal medal in 1879 and the royal medal of the netherlands in 1884 .
his most notable discovery was the first demonstration of chemical mobility , also known as liquid-non-metallic microspheres , as well as a field-effect microsphere , which was a device which demonstrated high strength and speed at very low temperatures .


== life and work ==
bellinghausen obtained his habilitation in chemistry from the university of liège in 1888 and spent most of his later life at liège , where he conducted clinical work and was appointed a professor of chemistry and physics at the faculty of medicine in 1899 . at liège he led the swedish textile institute in their first years of existence , and in 1912 succeeded carl stiegler as director of the institute and dean of the chemistry department . bellinghausen worked on the stationary gel theory , developed in the 1880s , which was the basis for the mineral hypothesis of j. j. thomson . he also developed an instrument for measuring the half-life of solvent ( later used for the record keeping of chemical reactions ) . in 1889 bellinghausen published the `` tetrahedral disulfide ring `` ( teds ) , a discovery which put him at the forefront of the ether theory . the tetrahedral disulfide ring was the first such theoretical unit to be provided with stereophase , the polymerization process involved in the manufacturing of silicon dioxide , a compound widely used in today 's electronics , and was particularly important in the dye process . he also discovered the euthenic liquid state of amino acids ( 1894 ) .
in 1893 bellinghausen co-founded the allgemeine physikae des chemie-neueren vereins ( apnv ) , a research group which investigated the role of formaldehyde as an absorbent and dispersant for microspheres . he spent the rest of his career at the amnh , where he oversaw the development of many outstanding chemical instruments such as the microspheres and electromagnetic oscillators , creating one of the best laboratories in the world .
bellinghausen died in liège , aged 65 , on 9 february 1935 . he is buried at the abbeville cemetery .

== biography ==


=== education ===

paul russell was born in pişmen , the son of cyril and mathilde russell . he studied physics at bucharest university , where he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in 1931 . he then enrolled in the newly founded university of bucharest in 1934 , and completed his ph.d. in physics in 1936 with the thesis `` the effect of the hydrogen-air mixture in a magnetosphere `` . he continued teaching , attending seminars on magnetic and aeronautics as a guest lecturer . as a graduate student in the same year , he also became a full professor .


=== career ===
after graduating , he accepted an appointment as an associate professor in the physics department at the faculty of science in bucharest . he soon became a professor , and in 1957 , a full professor . the school 's successor , the faculty of technology , in 1960 became his alma mater . he was also appointed as the acting head of the department of physics , faculty of science . he held this position until 1973 , and as an honorary professor until 1979 . he died in bucharest in 2003 .


=== research ===

he is best known for his research in the application of nuclear magnetic resonance in optical and radio astronomy , where he applied theories from quantum mechanics to the analysis of motion in galaxies . the problem was posed by the implication of static electricity-magnetic fields on the observed motion of binary stars . in its most basic form , he concluded that these fields , caused by interactions of strong and weak magnetic fields on nearby stars , produce electromagnetic structures not observed in observed stellar systems.russell 's work on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) inspired two subsequent cosmological textbooks , one written by georges rolland-barthaume at the university of grenoble in 1946 and another by mihail feugelé in 1952 . in the latter he presented a better analysis of the cosmic microwave background , and he was awarded the chair at the romanian academy of sciences in 1967 . he also had an influential academic contribution in terms of the aesthetics of cosmology , resulting in his the mainframe geometrical architecture ( 1958 ) and interaction of atomic fields ( 1965 ) .the discovery of neutrinos in 1977 challenged the model of russell and feugelé that neutrinos are particles bound together by a metal nucleus ( or antiferromagnet ) , as was thought previously . however , neutrinos can also be seen as `` invisible `` particles , often appearing in low amounts , and have been dubbed dark matter . the discovery was the culmination of 28 years of work by b.s.e . russell and m.s.m . feugelé , which he was initially unaware of , and which led him to form an entirely new paradigm regarding neutrinos .
he also created a magnetic time-averaging station in pescăişnă , which used external measuring instruments for its measurements , and was considered to be the first such time-averaging station in the world .


== awards ==
in 1968 , he received the dr. petro-sangaran prize ( an award from the romanian academy of sciences ) , of the division of educational research . in the same year he received the g. lucescu-sinc or william e. creighton award ( awarded by the linnean society of edinburgh ) , the world 's most prestigious international recognition for discovering a new science . he was elected a foreign honorary member of the royal society in 1992 , and elected a foreign member of the american physical society in 1999 . in 1983 , he received the costa medal , awarded to outstanding romanian scientists . he was elected a member of the romanian academy of sciences , royal academy of sciences of bucharest ( romanian : ( nămenhora bucharest ) romanieții ) ( zagăbul ) ( or aristeza bucharest ) , and his name is inscribed on the pantheon of rome , with the title of paul christian russell .

at yale , jecchi 's studies led to theoretical work on the cosmic microwave background radiation , as well as the enrico fermi paradox , as well as theoretical investigations on the properties of subatomic particles . he received his ph.d. in 1942 under the direction of robert millikan , in which the work was directed at the `` young high-energy protons `` as emitted from solar flares . jecchi ’ s work focused on studying polarization in the cmb . for his doctoral thesis , he developed a method for the detection of very strong polarization , using an external rotating interference device . in his 1950 book ( pdf ) , he argued that cmb polarization had what he termed an `` anomalous intrinsic pattern `` that favored observations of structural groupings , which he labeled “ electromagnetic sideshifts ” . although the illusionary symmetry of light polarization did not have profound implications for cosmic particle physics , jecchi believed it to be a problem that was “ worthy of careful study . ” in the 1960s , he used this research in a series of experiments on various “ outer-hemisphere phases ” , including the mesons of the hydrogen atom . during these experiments , he was unable to find the regions of polarization in the cmb that would permit the detection of cmb-formation .
in 1950 , jecchi moved to the carnegie institution of washington ( cern ) in geneva , switzerland , as professor of theoretical physics . following an investigation of the cmb by j.d . dreyfuss and j.j. redding , he was elected a member of the american physical society in 1970 . during his tenure at cern , he carried out pioneering experiments on ionization x-ray and gamma-ray scattering in the medium-energy and high-energy regions of the cmb . in 1971 , he received the nobel prize in physics for this work . in 1988 , he was an emeritus professor at yale university . in 1999 , he received the c.c . spencer award from the max planck society .


== honors and awards ==
jecchi received the cooper clarke medal in 1964 , the goethe medal in 1971 , the gold medal from the royal society of london , and the albert c. clarke medal from the national academy of sciences in 1975 .

bruno coson ( march 4 , 1881 – january 16 , 1955 ) was a hungarian physicist and natural scientist . he received his doctorate in 1915 from the university of vienna under paul ehrenfest .


== background ==
coson was born in budapest . he studied physics and mathematics at the technical university of budapest and later worked at the physics institute of the university of budapest . coson was employed by the government of hungary in world war i as a physicist .


== career ==
in world war ii , coson worked for the second airborne division of the hungarian army . in the spring of 1945 , he became the director of the institute of nuclear physics . he was awarded the national medal of science and arts in 1947 . in 1953 , he became professor of the physical chemistry department of the technische hochschule für wissenschaften and now the hannoverische hochschule für technik .


== personal life ==


=== economic issues ===
in the 1920s , he led the effort to turn physics into a science of both economic and public welfare . this is known as the coson principle and it has led to reforms in such areas as the electric car , the life insurance scheme , and the social insurance and pensions plans .


=== political issues ===
coson was the chair of the communist party . he defended the antisemitism of the dictatorship of tito in yugoslavia during world war ii . he was also a dedicated nazi activist who protested against the fascist `` racial register `` issued by the german states .
coson was an early member of the austrian people 's party . in 1930 , the party asked for his help with the subsequent draft of a new constitution for austria . the draft also was advocated by coson 's friend , the conservative philosopher karl hess . the parliamentary opposition in austria took the absurd step of introducing a series of laws requiring anti-semitism to be legally defined . in one , enacted in 1930 , the term `` fuhrer `` ( the president ) of austria was defined as the head of state who chose the new constitution , thus limiting coson 's role in the process .
in november 1930 , coson received a secret communication from max lidz , nazi party leader and chairman of the austrian central office , who promised to take over his department in a power vacuum . after two months of negotiations , coson was presented as the candidate to succeed lidz .
he resigned the chair of the institute of nuclear physics , resigned his office and resigned his membership of the federal executive council . in march 1933 , for the first time , austria lost its national elections . lidz offered to resign for the good of his party and coson declined the offer.for the postwar years , he was professor of physics at the eth zurich . between 1940 and 1941 , he was also president of the austrian society of mechanical engineers and from 1951 to 1953 , he was chairman of the institute of nuclear physics .
in june 1948 , he and his wife , elisabeth , emigrated to canada where he became a professor of natural sciences at york university . his student kapellmeister stefan schlick became a prominent radioamateur in canada and subsequently worked as a professor of physics at the university of toronto . he died in guelph , ontario .


== research ==
his outstanding research was in the fields of nuclear physics , physical chemistry , and radiochemistry . his achievements include the development of simple spectroscopy , the characterisation of crystalline nitrogen in ionospheres , the assimilation of nitrogen into carbon , and the atomic spectra of nuclei .

=== transformations ===
the units of kraszewski 's transformations are the transversals ( ω -π ) , the extenders ( π -πt ) , and the extenders of the three new methods are the theta functions ( ν-ξ , ξ-ξt ) .he introduced transversals in 1923 , and they now form the basis of all theorems of heta functions . these were also the first basis of the base-theta function . the averrett–karcher-eurowitz theorem for determining the scalar acceleration of light is a classic example of a transform

jack sloman ( march 15 , 1871 – july 25 , 1949 ) was a new york city civil engineer , foreman and author . he became well known after his essay `` a new bayou in a land moved by private vessels `` in which he detailed numerous ways in which private enterprise could improve public service and the quality of life in new york city.sloman served on the commission of the united states commission on shore roads from 1895 to 1898 , the department of new york from 1903 to 1907 , and was a member of the new york city board of health . in 1917 , sloman became a member of the united states national academy of engineering .


== background ==
born in bexar county , texas , sloman was a son of william sloman ( 1844-1902 ) , of marigold , texas , and martha sloman , née marcus ( d. 1909 ) . his grandfather was jesse marcus of johnstown , pennsylvania .
after graduating from westview high school , sloman transferred to harvard college in 1892 . while still a student he began work as an insurance agent for the first federal insurance company , serving there as a foreman in the 1870s , and then , in 1873 , at the newly opened office of westinghouse electric company . after getting out of the insurance business he moved to new york to work for the first consolidated railroad until a few months before the company was destroyed by fire .


== professional background ==
sloman was born into a family of engineering professionals who had gone through seven generations of engineers . his father was jesse marcus . a descendant of 18th-century preachers john allen and mary ann lee , sloman was also the third and youngest son of jesse marcus of wharton , pennsylvania . sloman wrote for the new york gazette , the new york evening post , the new york herald tribune , the civilian review , and other publications .
sloman married the former alice buck , of new york city , in 1893 . their son , tom sloman , was raised in berkeley , california , and is now an author of poetry and a professor of english at the city university of new york.in 1891 sloman published `` two characters of civil engineers `` and followed with his best-known essay `` a new bayou in a land moved by private vessels `` . with the exception of a short article on the elmira school that appeared in the los angeles city journal in 1904 , the rest of his work was based on similar material published in other publications , mainly by anderson . the essay was so well known that the department of public works commissioned sloman to prepare a pamphlet in support of its study on the railroad and its potential value . however , the report never came to completion . after the passage of the railroad decade act of 1897 and passage of the rail link act of 1901 , many of the policies of former governor charles van buren and the federal government began to reflect their views about the public sector . consequently , proposals of improvement in the state and federal governments began to come from state , state and federal governments . sloman decided that the public sector might benefit from some assistance . he had been advocating the creation of a state-sponsored industrial laboratory , later renamed the state engineering laboratories , to train the public sector . a proposal for a $ 1,500 yearly stipend to support a staff of 22 persons would be initially sent to the legislature . however , the experimental stations were closed down in 1904 , and he was not able to secure the financial assistance he needed . this setback ultimately led sloman to set out for new orleans , louisiana , where he would finally publish his best-known work , new orleans : an american city on october 13 , 1903 .

histo-histochemistry has since become the most widely used form of experimental histochemistry . the concept of the alkaline phosphatase ( the physiochemical method of culture ) .
most of the best known laboratories of bio-technological research are now devoted to the development of technology and methods of chemical control of chemical reactions . biochemists in many countries are determined to secure control of the results of such research .
in spite of this research being of great importance for chemistry as well as for physiological research , it still has to wait for a great synthesis , also from a french chemist . in 1948 jacques éidelman co-founded the `` édouard sarré ’ s group `` at the paris polytechnic in which he endowed the final position in the research program , which began from 1951 until his death .

oskar windisch ( 12 december 1748 – 16 february 1837 ) was a czech mathematician who made fundamental contributions in the analysis of the equations of motion of air and of metals , derived the finest formalized calculus of variations and was instrumental in determining the electronic voltages in the late 18th century . his work is noteworthy not only for his mathematical accomplishments but also for his social and philosophical beliefs .


== early years ==
windisch was born in tancred , in today 's czech republic . he had his early education in his hometown . his family left tancred after his father died in 1768 . this led to many years of living in local towns where windisch found employment working as an apprentice before returning to the city . he enrolled in the gymnasium ( school ) of the bolshoi but chose to continue at stendal when it became available . during this time , he decided to study abroad in order to obtain his degree .


== career ==

after completing his doctorate , he was a lecturer at the university of prague for a few years before becoming a full professor in 1818 . from 1825 he was director of the institute for theoretical mechanics . he began to focus his efforts on the analysis of gases . in 1826 , he published his definitive paper on the leibnizian principle of formal equations of motion ( 1862 ) . however , these results can be considered as the foundation for the geometric calculus of variations and the geometrical mechanics of compounds . after world war ii , however , he returned to the university as a faculty member , where he was instrumental in publishing the development of the theoretical development of the electrochemical system , introduced in 1919 by professor mošilov , into the curriculum . he was later elected president of the academy in 1950 .


== inartistic works ==
windisch is best known for his 1910 publication ‘ on the non-stretching collisions of the media in open or closed spaces ” . this paper , an anatomical result from construction problems , addresses the popular misconception that the movements of mass in an open space are caused by `` most intense compression `` by collisions between the spaces within . it posits the existence of a region of discontinuity , called the ‘ collapsed ’ area , which is outside the action potentials of the closed space .


== family ==
windisch 's son , josef windisch , was a physician , the nephew of the famous physician-general aukerman and the uncle of czesław aikin.his daughter , anne , was an art historian . she married the economist ilia wibowo , in 1910 .

on 20 april 1882 , he was sent by émile perrin to head the division for the analysis of measurements in the department of astronomy and the university observatory , which was at that time investigating the nature and methods of the trigonometrical method and the formation of an orbital orbit . this made his position in the french imperial census office a combination of teaching ( meteorology ) and research ( his work on comets and comets around mars ) , so that he managed to earn a post of special assistant in the office of the university observatory for much of the latter period of his life , at the very least until 1903 .
in 1907 , he returned to paris to prepare maps for the construction of an astronomical observatory . the results of his work on `` fraunhofer der gegenseitetischen institut der universität leipzig `` were published in 1898 and 1906 , but before the completion of the observatory could be completed , the weizmann institute of science transferred him to the solar physics laboratory in new york , where he served until 1922 , when he took up the position of university professor of elementary and applied mathematics . after world war ii , he served as director of the astrophysical observatory from 1949 to 1969 , a position he maintained until his death.the jodrell laboratory built by andré brecheil , known as the `` planetarium `` , contains eight 3-inch quartz stars . among the instruments on display there is a camera used to record gamma-rays.brecheil , whose astronomy books include `` commentaire sur les nomenclature , sur les figures du témoins , sur les arrondissements , et sur les modes , demiennes , de la détermination des énergies `` ( a universal reference for numerical nomenclature , a text about how to pronounce the names of stars , planets , and demi-annular modes , etc. , in english ) , was known for his generosity . he generously donated about three years of his fortune ( 1950–1954 ) to local schools in an effort to build the ancona observatory , which is now a member of the university of california . also in 1951 , brecheil helped in the construction of a new conference room at the former house of the société a l'école française de france , located at 718 lauriston avenue in paris .

philun was a co-founder of the science of quantum mechanics . in 1944 , he proposed the possibility of a modern electromagnetic theory in an experiment that involved condensation of magnetic monopoles , and as a result of this , the principle of photoelectric polarization of polarized light was invented . this allows the existence of bipolar polarization .
the idea of an electromagnetic photon bombardment enabled to the investigation of polarized light radiation , and subsequently led to the formulation of a theorem in quantum electrodynamics .
in 1955 , philun described the concept of rayleigh scattering in the normal scattering phase of polarized light .
he was a recipient of the first deputy governor of the ussr state prize ( 1961 ) , with the name of `` professor of physics `` ( from 1961 , he could receive the title of a member of the ussr academy of sciences ) . philun was a recipient of the second deputy governor 's prize ( 1963 ) .

=== behavior ===
in her work with music therapy , holm also explored the behavioral consequences of tone control and time-out in rats . in 1971 , holm , along with james anderson , reported the first demonstration of an increase in a rat 's motivation to play when time-out followed by a tone change resulted in an increase in the rat 's performance and playing time .

= rudolf kreisler =
rudolf kreisler ( 25 march 1876 – 9 february 1954 ) was an austrian physicist who made contributions to electrical conductivity , thermodynamics and scattering . he was an early pioneer of x-ray crystallography and the best known crystal-crystallographer at the time . he is often credited as the first crystallographer to observe liquid crystals , but this claim is false , as he was not the first to observe crystal-crystallographic phenomena . the paper describing the phenomenon is now known as kirchhoff-kreisler 's analysis . he is known for the use of electric discharges . he also invented the kreisler cell , a coil of electrically conductive wire .


== education and early career ==
rudolf kreisler was born in halle and received an early education in mathematics , physics and mathematics in lausanne . he worked for a time in the mining industry in bohemia and then worked as a carpenter in frankfurt am main . kreisler obtained his doctorate in berlin in 1902 with a thesis on the critical condition of neutron-proton pairs . during his time in the laboratory , he completed a fundamental study of the electric current in the atmosphere , which is at the center of modern x-ray spectroscopy.from 1903 to 1908 kreisler taught elementary and high school in hamburg . in 1909 he worked as a demonstrator for a year at the gewerbeinnenraue technische hochschule in halle . kreisler was appointed professor of electrical engineering in 1911 and in 1913 became a faculty member at the karlsruhe technische hochschule .
in 1913 kreisler started a german textbook in x-ray crystallography . in 1916 kreisler founded the institute for x-ray crystallography at the kaiser wilhelm institute for technical research in karlsruhe . he was succeeded in the institute in 1918 by carl jacoby , who maintained connections with kreisler and made kreisler a director . in 1920 kreisler was the editor of the journal optik.with max hermann , he developed a large number of x-ray crystallographic experiments . in 1926 he invented the kreisler cell , which measures the fluorescence of x-ray diffracted light . the colorimetric gel cells were used during an x-ray crystallographic experiment to calculate the number of individual atoms on the surface of gold.in 1927 kreisler was the first to model the diffusion of liquids through crystals . in 1933 , kreisler discovered that different conduction paths are available for liquids with the same carbon content.in 1935 kreisler invented an x-ray diffraction microscope which allowed him to study molecules and molecules of different types and proportions . he discovered that x-ray crystals are distinguishable from one another because of a faint shift of emission ( kreisler-horn ) . kreisler studied the effect of carbon dioxide on magnetic moments . kreisler 's discovery gave the theoretical basis for carbon dioxide molecular signals . with howard silliman , kreisler became a member of the faculty at the university of vienna .


== x-ray crystallography ==
kreisler showed that carbon dioxide with similar carbon content , such as that found in the soil , had different magnetic properties than that of the soil.kreisler applied his results to studying x-ray diffraction microscopy . a large part of kreisler 's work was concerned with optical transitions . he investigated the spectral composition of electrical discharges from passing carriages through lines of conductive wire . he considered how x-ray diffraction resolved a spectrum of few wavelengths of light and about what elements were present in the discharge .
he was a founder of the institute for x-ray crystallography , which was later merged with the university of giessen 's department of chemistry . kreisler was elected as one of the founders of the royal society in 1914 . his name was attached to the x-ray microscopy in 1924 by wilhelm friedrich von rath , karl friedrich wilhelm fritz , gerhard müller , rudolf schermer and august i. herder .


== later life ==
kreisler became concerned with the mass production of high temperature liquid crystals , and moved to gewerbeinnenraue . he established the kreisler alcoolatorium ( the first of its kind in germany ) in 1919 in gewerbeinnenraue . he died in gewerbeinnenraue in 1954 . he is buried in karlsruhe cemetery .

born in akhmet bulut 's hometown in the far northwest of turkey , akhmet bulut studied economics , law , philosophy and history at a university in istanbul . he obtained his phd in 1933 . in 1936 he joined the turkish faculty of political science .
in 1941 he emigrated to the united states . from 1950 to 1955 he worked as a professor of political science at vanderbilt university , the university 's main research center .
in 1963 he left vanderbilt and became director of the center for economic and international studies at the university of oxford , where he worked with neville a. chamberlain . in 1970 he became a visiting professor at the same university , then in 1971–1975 he was professor emeritus . at oxford , he was known as the patron of the discipline of economic geography .
in the early 1970s , he started working as a fellow at the center for international studies of the new school for social research , which he would depart from in 1979 . bulut was honored with honorary doctorates from the johns hopkins university , the university of california , los angeles , the university of michigan , and the university of edinburgh , and in 1988 the university of toronto awarded him the mclellan prize in economics and economics of human values .
bulut 's influence on globalization also extends beyond his own home country . in the 1980s , he played a role in the formation of the world bank and the international monetary fund . as a result of his work at the world bank , the institute for international economic studies ( ies ) was born . the ies developed a program in economics called `` the world economy `` that advanced the work of abdullah iraklyan of the international institute for social studies ( iss ) , which before him was primarily focused on german and soviet studies . ies financed bulut 's translation of friedrich von hayek 's social statics into turkish in 1987 and another called welfare economics in 1990 .

a few years later , he wrote his more important book on middle eastern history , book iuris de polonie italianorum , or arabic pilgrims and jews of italy . the second volume , la sénégal des pacifiens , a translation of the latin of saint teresa and known to be the first scientific text on the history of the united states , was translated into latin in 1611 by pope pius ix , and was a widely read work . hopp was also the first to investigate the political conditions in cyprus . he was highly respected for his research , publishing the third and fourth volumes of book iuris . the manuscript manuscript of the third volume is housed in the bavarian state library of the university of halle .
after the fall of the principality of venice in 1619 , hopp resumed his position as private secretary , and wrote his well-received history of the pilgrims and jews of sicily ( 1616 ) , the major work on the island . in it he coined the modern term `` mussulman `` , a term that has given rise to rivalry between italian-american and american-jewish historians.the royal danish alumni hall of science at athens , under hopp 's leadership , is named in his honor .

hopp wrote his last work in 1628 , the history of the bible in 4 volumes : du étude nouvelle , et des mouvements de nature ( 4 volumes , 4 volumes , 4 volumes ) .

after returning to berlin in 1938 , degeirwàn returned to the united states , taking over as director of the neuropsychiatric hospital department at the imperial college hospital , where he retired in 1945 . he died at home in boston , massachusetts , at the age of 87 . his son , boerhilde degeirwàn , is also an influential neurologist.degeirwàn conducted pioneering research into nervous conduction . one of his studies was investigating the relation between depression and the thoracic spine and spinal cord . he hypothesized that depression affects the phalangeal process of the spinal cord through corticosteroid action , leading to a disruption in the pattern of electrical activity in the spinal cord . this type of disruption is an indicator of the subglial origin of depression , and therefore that depression is associated with sympathetic nervous system dysfunction . he concluded that , because depression increases the risk of spinal-cord injury , it should be regarded as a form of `` glucocorticoid-induced arthritic disease `` . he was known for his studies of specific neurotransmitters , and he proposed that neurotransmitters include acetylcholine , adrenaline , serotonin , norepinephrine , and dopamine . he concluded that these neurotransmitters are necessary for normal brain function , and research related to his work has been cited by more than two hundred researchers and neurologists . his research led him to explain and put into practice a model of spinocerebellar dysfunction that has been described by other investigators . he also summarized the results of studies involving stroke , back pain , migraine , convulsions , and back problems , and he discussed the historical origins of the mental disorder of phlebitis . his late essays have been translated into many languages , including persian , italian , german , italian and dutch .
he was one of the first to observe that the first stages of life have a complex relationship to the development of brains . early stages of brain development were stable or stable , but in later stages , stages 2 and 3 of brain development show a more or less irregular pattern . he summarized these early stages of brain development and identified major phases of the brain during childhood : auditory ( affect ) , visual ( action ) , motor ( vision ) , and sensory ( memory ) stages.degeirwàn served as editor of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences from 1928 until 1948 , and the american journal of psychiatry from 1935 until 1950.degeirwàn earned the franklin institute of the advancement of medical science medal in 1935 .

christoph wilhelm neumann ( 23 september 1877 – 10 may 1965 ) was a german-born scientist and sociologist .


== biography ==
christoph wilhelm neumann was born in stuttgart on 23 september 1877 and emigrated to the united states in 1912 . he was a music professor in stuttgart and became active in the social sciences in the us . he taught for 30 years at brown university . in 1919 he completed a doctorate at johns hopkins university .
he became professor of economics at the university of chicago from 1931-1948 , and from 1948 until his retirement in 1975 became dean of the graduate school of public administration .
in his first book ( 1946 ) he defended the contributions of labor theory in the theory of population sociology , later reopening this idea with his most influential book , the economic origins of population ( 1947 ) . this began the current trend in demographic and social sociology that economists claim is a response to the `` energy crisis `` of world war ii , a conflict in which technological modernization led to increased demand for the working class and an increase in the status of women and of racial minorities .


== work ==
neumann examined the role of the concentration of wages in industrial production , to determine how unemployment affected consumption .
neumann believed that the effects of technology could be exploited by the employing classes , and published studies that he hoped would be used as a lesson in urban sociology . in a 1941 article he wrote about the economic education of low-income children , he predicted that such courses would help lower-class children to develop an understanding of the values and values of competition . he did however draw a comparison with marxism , in that it taught children to think critically . for example , neumann predicted that marx 's criticism of the contradiction between proletariat 's economic interest in the production of surplus value and capitalist exploitation of labour would contribute to the emergence of a concept of `` laddism `` in the worker 's class consciousness that would inform future counter-revolutionary thinking .

neumann 's focus on wages was influential during the post-war `` third industrial revolution `` in which wages were a major political issue . following a revolution in 1947 for which neumann was best known , wages took a back seat for working-class resistance to cuts in state services . wages in germany and in other developed capitalist countries have since been on a steady upward trajectory . when it came to matters of wages , by the 1950s the human demand theory that neumann developed , similar to walter reed 's , had been widely applied in the development of neo-liberalism . neumann warned that the `` pace of technological advance has outstripped marx 's vision of a dialectical progression of technology that eventually transcends capitalism and arrives at socialism `` . during this period , neumann also began developing the notion of labor supply and demanded that society institute policies that would increase it , proposing the concept of `` socialized labor `` in a 1948 article .

neumann married his wife , anna , in 1924 . they had five children , one of whom became a statistician . he was also a pianist , violinist and harpsichordist .

== biography ==
john ray hubbard was born on 7 june 1907 in sandringham , queensland . he had two brothers , gerald and george , who all went on to achieve leading positions in industry and science . he studied geology at melbourne university ( 1921-24 ) and received his bsc ( 1925 ) and msc ( 1925 ) from sydney university . he was awarded a visiting professorship from the university of california , berkeley ( 1928 ) and was a student of sir alfred north whitehead , an authority on the human genealogy . in 1930 he was awarded the mosman medal , the highest honour of australian university academics.he retired from the university of sydney in 1968 . he taught at griffith university , a government school , from 1971 to 1972 . he also was the australian secretary of the world academy of sciences from 1969 to 1972 .


== influence ==
as a scientific advocate of the aboriginal `` past , hubbard shared the beliefs of anthropologist edward tolmie that aboriginal cultures were settled by a stream of migrants from ancient lands who originally became citizens of australia and migrated as inland settlers . he was also an early proponent of the idea that the boer wars with the british that nearly split the country was over land issues .
in a number of his books , hubbard describes various myths and legends that influenced his thinking . in the secret life of an aborigine he describes aboriginal `` ceremonial ecstasy `` as a means of manipulating their humanity , defining an enemy as either an enemy of the tribe or their creator . in the same book , he claims that the aborigine 's aboriginal name is maat . hubbard considered it a repugnant word that would vilify and dehumanise the aborigines and led him to retract the epithet . in the final chapters of his book , hubbard lists some of the reasons for rejecting the ethnic origins of aborigines , saying they are 'not good people. `` this is not the first time hubbard had used the word `` butcher `` , but his use of it makes it the most common the word has been used in australian public speech .
hubbard 's use of the word also triggered a backlash , and his use of it led to public protests .
in his autobiography , hubbard is said to have denied that he was a jew . hubbard 's daughter kristine also denied that hubbard was a member of any illegal party or organisation .

sinclair was born in redruth . in 1888 he started work at the now defunct royal botanic gardens , kew , where he developed a particular interest in the mosses he found growing in the grounds . he later lived at westfield house , where he built up an extensive collection of mosses , most of which was grown on the estate . in the 1840s he was elected fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and in 1851 was appointed curator of the plant section at kew . in 1857 he moved to newnham abbey , london , where he set up a prolific garden and , in 1870 , established the botanical and floral museum at his abbey . sinclair 's collection was given to the kew society .
he was the first person in scotland to collect british species of fungi . many of his work was characterized by close research and meticulous labelling , but his main work took him to the south-western regions of england , france , spain , and norway , where he established and established a relationship with botanists such as james chadwick , ralph rivers , alexander arnold and lord rayleigh . his collections can still be found at kew gardens in the form of tablets and microscopes .

= christoph erziehung =
christoph georg erziehung ( 4 august 1832 – 5 august 1915 ) was a german mining engineer , physicist and a natural scientist . his father , friedrich christoph erziehung ( b . 25 january 1844 ) , was a composer of operas , and mother was anna raalda in 1832 .
he studied engineering under wilhelm von liebig at the university of tübingen , where he made important discoveries in solid-state physics , especially in photographic calorimetry , and on the speed of electricity .
in the winter of 1864–65 he was inspector of mining engineering at metz , and as an assistant in the metallurgical institute ( siemens ) at braunschweig . in 1871–72 he was elected a member of the german academy of sciences and letters , and in 1877–78 a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences .
in 1879 erziehung and heinrich locher-wolff ( 1809–1887 ) were among the first in europe to see the possibility of a method for extracting platinum from meteorites . this lead to discoveries in the mineralogy of rare elements , and new studies on the possibility of producing platinum from fissile uranium ( of which germany is in a crisis ) and thorium ( of which no more than two countries have produced a period of history of this production ) .
in 1887 he was elected the director of the central institute for metallurgical research in the city of braunschweig , which had been established at that time to oversee this research . the institute , which still exists today , is among the leading research centers of the world .
erziehung died in braunschweig on 5 august 1915 .

adolf korelitzky ( russian : бард барович мирликов , born nov. 21 , 1882 in artemivsk , german : [ koleːlɛlθʲɪvʲɪs ] ; june 11 , 1919 – april 3 , 1966 ) was a soviet–soviet physicist who worked on nuclear physics .
he studied physics and became a full professor in 1917 .
korelitzky was a strong supporter of the theory of relativity , studying its principles of governing the behaviour of particles and of regularities in elasticity . in 1903 , he was the first to prove the lorentz transformation ( then known as the lorentz transform ) for one of the fundamental particles , atomic hydrogen . two years later , he showed that the same transformation would not hold for all elementary particles , with a special `` incorrect `` case where one of the three observers were correct .
in 1905 , he developed a theory based on the lorentz transformation that could explain the structure of protons . theory was proven by august schrödinger in 1924 and was later popularized by robert a. millikan in the book quantum mechanics . the result has been called the `` most significant discovery `` in the history of physics.in the laboratory of his father in moscow , he developed the three-body problem and the klein–dahle problem , as well as the thin sheet paradox . in his subsequent research , he showed how to find three new quarks ( h+ , h+2 and h2+ ) by solving the differential equations of the schwinger–gerlach constant that produced them and his telegram on 3 june 1928 expressing his complete agreement with the standard model . according to the theory , the transition from h+ to h2+ was not discovered until 1939 by the argentine theoretical physicist alfredo rocha .
in 1941 , he developed the so-called dritsen fragment of the black hole and the schwarzschild fragment .
