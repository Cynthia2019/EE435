= eduard riehl =
eduard august josef riehl ( 22 december 1849 – 9 april 1933 ) was a german painter and art historian , noted for his impressionistic paintings and his passion for the sciences .


== life ==
born in halle an der saale ( today 's czech republic ) , riehl was educated at the halle gymnasium and the königsberg academy , where his father was a student . in 1887 , he enrolled at the university of berlin and then entered the faculty of philosophy in 1889.upon becoming a professor , riehl devoted himself primarily to art and graduated in 1899 . this friendship formed the basis of his collaboration with the mathematician august otto von hayek , the latter of whom he was a lifelong admirer . after his graduation , riehl accepted an appointment as a professor at the university of stuttgart and became an assistant professor in 1902 , professor in 1905 , and full professor in 1911.in 1896 , he was appointed artistic director at the humboldt university of berlin . he held this position until 1910.in 1910 , riehl was appointed director of the humboldt university of berlin , a position which he held until 1916 , when the university was transferred to munich . the remainder of his career was spent at the riehl-koch-werke museum in leipzig and the institute for historical art and the art of guillaume-françois cabanis in london .


== views ==
influenced by the concepts of the german romantic philosophy , riehl took an interest in various branches of psychology and had a deeply significant influence on his successors in art . riehl was a conservative member of the société impressionisme . in the field of mythology , he strove to find an identification between the expressive forms of the mythological images , as represented by the concrete sculptures , and the relations between thought and life in the painter 's own consciousness .
in the influence of many influential early german romantic psychologists , such as hermann schelling and carl jung , riehl wanted to pursue an interest in historical themes through his narrative . riehl wrote a number of books on the theme of the history of art and ideas . his most influential works are hermann schelling and the rhine : die weltkrankheit in der hochschen altertums ( 1900 ) , and deutschlands geographie ( 1906 ) . after suffering from various crises in his career , he was forced to resign from his chair at the humboldt university of berlin , and was succeeded by the theologian josef köhn , a man well versed in the study of german romanticism and the philosophy of aesthetics , whose historiological style still remains influential .

giuseppe tanca ( 11 september 1782 – 24 july 1843 ) was an italian naturalist , zoologist , and paleontologist .

the young tanca could draw and use the most basic zoological knowledge . the chief problem to be solved was to see if any trace of fossil animals could be found in the earth , at that time the most productive geological resources in the world . tanca studied in the same gymnasium as other renowned naturalists , such as sir joseph banks , isaac newton and archibald spencer.tanca also studied physics and chemistry , and wrote short works on these subjects . after his graduation he joined the anatomical laboratory of the archaeologist j. schleiermacher . this was an extraordinary laboratory for the time , being a state museum of egypt , the discoverer of the first pyramid of giza .
at this time tanca began to treat in much greater detail the phanerogams of insects . an opportunity to visit the ancient botanical garden of florence 's scuola sarmiento ( all around it were the preserved skeletons of more than 150 famous lepidopterists , from around the world ) presented him with the idea of an expedition to asia , a goal that aroused the excitement of the florence academy , and also provided him with an opportunity to collect as many insect fossils as possible . before his departure for asia , tanca developed a theory of animal camouflage that was much more direct than the attempts by other investigators . the hypothesis predated napoleonic campaigns in asia . its explanation was a reservoir of water that the insect hid in the larvae .
in early april 1804 tanca and his scientific crew arrived at the site of the pyramids of giza . they found that the sphinx had been reinforced with elaborate brickwork . tanca completed his scientific work before leaving for asia .
at his death in 1843 tanca 's collections reached an estimated 400,000 specimens .

the strength of his voice lies in the way he can allow the guitar and the piano to thrive in a particular set of arrangements . the trios he composed with nadol , dumoulin , and morand-séguin are based on previously recorded pieces , and had the benefit of circulating in several major cities , often at the time when much of the music they were based on was being written and recorded .


== education and early life ==

adèle ollivier was born in meyrin , brittany . he started his career in the music conservatory of the royal city of valence . in 1867 , his formative years , the `` affaire de musique `` was founded , founded in memory of claude-hugues dicapie , and his teachers were determined to bring him closer to the choirs of the regnum des theon . with the help of his brother-in-law , léonard de solberg , ollivier began his studies of composition with georges bizet .


=== ministry ===
the ministry of music was in direct competition with the choir of valence , which became very popular .
after six years of working in the choirs , ollivier was demoted to the rank of secretary in the ministry of music . after six years as a minister , he went to paris , where he stayed for eleven years , starting in 1878 . a later success was the establishment of the conservatoire de paris .


=== work and life ===
on 18 october 1878 , ollivier married jacqueline , also from meyrin , and soon after moved back to paris to begin his studies . there he published a collection of simple songs called contrêt de jésus , which was published in 1890 . he also wrote pieces for the piano . he also wrote for the opera dieu du monde , and in 1906 he joined the cadenza school of music.on 3 june 1908 , the second of the concerts to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the restoration , ollivier succeeded dicapie in the chair of the musical studies of the conservatoire de paris.the composer was given access to one of the most sophisticated sets of piano rolls ever assembled by composers , and his method , which included extended passages of repeated measures and successive notes , was lauded by george massenet and w. h. auden.in november 1907 , dicapie left the conservatoire , and with it his new ministry of music . after that , ollivier became head of the school of composition . he was under the great responsibility of one of the greatest composers of all time , mozart .


=== death and legacy ===
ollivier died in paris on 10 april 1876 , aged 68 . ollivier left behind two daughters and six grandchildren . he left behind the operas zappia and il moro and three symphonies ( fantasie , the rape of lucrezia , les imaginations ) . he was buried in valence .

= josef hlouch =
josef hlouch ( 26 march 1902 - 10 june 1972 ) was a czech roman catholic prelate and theologian who served as the bishop of budweis from 1947 until his death . hlouch first served as a parish priest and professor in olomouc and other places before he was appointed to the episcopate following a standoff between ecclesial authorities and the nazis as to whom would assume the budweis episcopal see . he was installed in his new diocese at a time when communist authorities solidified their control over the then-czechoslovakia which prompted hlouch and other ecclesial leaders such as josef beran to speak out against communist repression . hlouch was placed under house arrest and later exiled from his diocese but the prague spring allowed for him to return in 1968.the late bishop became known for his holiness and for his leadership of his old diocese and in 2015 the czech episcopal conference lodged a formal request to rome to open the beatification process . the process opened on 7 november 2017 and he became titled as a servant of god .


== life ==
josef hlouch was born in lipník in the třebíč district on 26 march 1902 to jakub hlouch and marie hlouchová .
in 1935 he obtained his doctorate in theological studies in olomouc after having obtained his habilitation in 1934 . he received his ordination to the priesthood in mid-1926 in olomouc from archbishop leopold prečan . from 1945 until his episcopal appointment he served as a professor to seminarians after having served as a pastor since 1939 just before world war ii began . in september 1928 he began serving as the parish administrator for the hodolana parish in olomouc .
hlouch was later appointed as a bishop and received his episcopal consecration from saverio ritter in olomouc with josef beran and stanislav zela serving as the co-consecrators .
his solemn enthronement in his episcopal see came as a relief to the faithful since the see had been vacant since 1940 . the nazis had opposed a particular prelate nominated for the position leading to pope pius xii leaving the see vacant ; the nazis defeat in 1945 allowed for hlouch to be appointed as a bishop . his constant criticisms and opposition to the communist regime in the then-czechoslovakia prompted his exile from the diocese . this was exacerbated when the authorities began monitoring all his activities after a 19 june 1949 sermon where he criticized the nation 's direction under the regime . he returned to his diocese on 9 june 1968 on the occasion of the prague spring . hlouch had even been placed under house arrest in 1950 and in 1952 was arrested and then exiled from his diocese without a court trial . he left for several cities during this time first in liberec and then in mladá vožice.in 1963 the facilitated negotiations between pope john xxiii and the czech socialist republic allowed for imprisoned bishops to be released . this prompted hlouch 's release in april 1963 .
in 1968 he sent a letter to miloslav vlk in which he asked the then-deacon to become his personal aide . this was much to vlk 's surprise who had hoped to go abroad for further studies . prior to vlk 's ordination he met with hlouch in the bishopric for breakfast one morning where he spoke to the prelate about his plans for his future studies . hlouch met with vlk again one morning in the bishopric for breakfast two weeks later in which the latter assented to the role . hlouch later ordained vlk as a priest on 23 june 1968 .
hlouch died on 10 june 1972 . his reputation for holiness had been noted in his life as well as for his gentle smile combined with his thoughtful nature . the communists did not allow for pope paul vi to name a successor which rendered the see vacant until pope john paul ii appointed miloslav vlk as hlouch 's successor .


== beatification process ==
from 2012 the late bishop 's friend and aide miloslav vlk - now a cardinal - said that a beatification process could be launched because the potential for a formal application to rome was something being evaluated . the czech episcopal conference in autumn 2015 made a formal application to the congregation for the causes of saints to launch the cause with the c.c.s . issuing the `` nihil obstat `` decree on 7 november 2017 in a move that titled hlouch as a servant of god.the diocesan process to collect documentation and witness testimonies is expected to be launched sometime in 2018 .

carl friedrich konrad vollmer ( 30 may [ o.s . 3 may ] 1768 in würzburg , bavaria – 13 january 1811 in munich , germany ) was a german anatomist and lithographer , best known as an inventor of the vollmer tube .


== biography ==


=== early life and education ===
born on 30 may 1768 , he grew up near würzburg in eastern bavaria . he was educated at the university of würzburg from 1790 to 1793 . he attended lectures of 1792 and 1795 at the lectures of the physiologist and anatomist christian wilhelm thiele at the university of tübingen .


=== career ===
vollmer 's career , which began in the year 1792 , was a difficult one . the monetary situation of the time made it difficult for talented young men to be sent to study medicine .
because of his poor health , vollmer completed his dissertation in 1798 at the university of tübingen . he gave lectures on anatomy at the teubner-schule in 1805 . that year , however , his health failed . in january 1806 , he left germany for the first time .
during this period , he experimented with both microscopes and an instrument for quickly tracing microvascular changes .


=== biography ===
as a result of his lectures and work , in 1812 vollmer was hired as a lecturer at the university of münster , where his lectures were notably wide-ranging . he used the microscope to determine the rectum . this turned out to be a good tool for reconstructing anatomy ; it was specially trained to use a microscope . but vollmer was eager to learn anatomy , and was never satisfied with what he learned .
in 1813 , vollmer was a posthumously appointed professor at the university of tübingen . here , he met andré messner . messner spent a year teaching at the university , and led vollmer 's early anatomical students on their studies of the lungs and other organs . in 1815 , vollmer was made a full professor , and the following year , he was named rector of the gymnasium of tübingen .
in 1816 vollmer became president of the volksbücher ( the society of bacteriologists ) ; he helped to expand the standard of knowledge regarding bacteria and eventually is credited as having laid the foundations of current microscopic microbiology .


=== later life ===
in 1823 , his wife , ursula verkoper , moved to england . the next year , vollmer married constance kreft , the daughter of an unsuccessful clergyman . they had six children .
as a result of his work , many later scientists , physicians and teachers would repeat vollmer 's discoveries . in his paper `` on the gastrocnemius rectum `` published in 1826 , vollmer wrote :

this anatomical system is based upon certain facts : that the nucleus of the gastrocnemius circumscribed by messner is the external junction of the different organs and its five subvening alimentary productions , the axillary-carca , the cryptogastric-adrenal , the adenosine-adrenal , the poppy-choroidal-nucleus , and the cholera-canceric ; that the proximal part of the urinary-vascular-body is the tubular secretion from the several lymphatic cells which are in great abundance throughout the body ; that this secretion is the centre of fermentation in all the clitocytotenyes of which we are aware , as they give the cause of the fermentation ; that the discharging division of this secretion from all the obstructed portions makes the ultimate separation of the small number of jars-pairs which are placed in the genital glands ; and , finally , that the sexual relation is a product of the internal structure rather than of the external operation .

vollmer died in munich in 1811 .

= lev pontryagin =
lev semyonovich pontryagin ( russian : лев семёнович понтрягин , also written pontriagin or pontrjagin ) ( 3 september 1908 – 3 may 1988 ) was a soviet mathematician . he was born in moscow and lost his eyesight due to a primus stove explosion when he was 14 . despite his blindness he was able to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century , partially with the help of his mother tatyana andreevna who read mathematical books and papers ( notably those of heinz hopf , j. h. c. whitehead , and hassler whitney ) to him . he made major discoveries in a number of fields of mathematics , including algebraic topology and differential topology .


== work ==
pontryagin worked on duality theory for homology while still a student . he went on to lay foundations for the abstract theory of the fourier transform , now called pontryagin duality . with rené thom , he is regarded as one of the co-founders of cobordism theory , and co-discoverers of the central idea of this theory , that framed cobordism and stable homotopy are equivalent . this led to the introduction around 1940 of a theory of certain characteristic classes , now called pontryagin classes , designed to vanish on a manifold that is a boundary . in 1942 he introduced the cohomology operations now called pontryagin squares . moreover , in operator theory there are specific instances of krein spaces called pontryagin spaces .
later in his career he worked in optimal control theory . his maximum principle is fundamental to the modern theory of optimization . he also introduced there the idea of a bang-bang principle , to describe situations where either the maximum 'steer ' should be applied to a system , or none.pontryagin authored several influential monographs as well as popular textbooks in mathematics .

pontryagin 's students include dmitri anosov , vladimir boltyansky , revaz gamkrelidze , evgeni mishchenko , mikhail postnikov , vladimir rokhlin , and mikhail zelikin .


== controversy and anti-semitism allegations ==
pontryagin was accused of anti-semitism on several occasions . for example , he attacked nathan jacobson for being a `` mediocre scientist `` representing the `` zionism movement `` , while both men were vice-presidents of the international mathematical union . he rejected charges of anti-semitism in an article published in science in 1979 , claiming that he struggled with zionism , which he considered a form of racism . when a prominent soviet jewish mathematician , grigory margulis , was selected by the imu to receive the fields medal at the upcoming 1978 icm , pontryagin , who was a member of the executive committee of the imu at the time , vigorously objected . although the imu stood by its decision to award margulis the fields medal , margulis was denied a soviet exit visa by the soviet authorities and was unable to attend the 1978 icm in person .
pontryagin also participated in a few notorious political campaigns in the soviet union , most notably , in the luzin affair .

== biography ==
son of john tradescant the elder , he was born in meopham , kent , and educated at the king 's school , canterbury . like his father , who collected specimens and rarities on his many trips abroad , he undertook collecting expeditions to virginia between 1628 and 1637 ( and possibly two more trips by 1662 , though potter and other authors doubt this ) . among the seeds he brought back , to introduce to english gardens were great american trees , including magnolias , bald cypress and tulip tree , and garden plants such as phlox and asters .
john tradescant the younger added his american acquisitions to the family 's cabinet of curiosities , known as the ark . these included the ceremonial cloak of chief powhatan , an important native american relic . south lambeth road in vauxhall was one of the boundaries of the tradescant estate , where the collection was kept and tradescant road was laid out after the estate was built on in the late 1800s and named after the family .
when his father died , he succeeded as head gardener to charles i and henrietta maria of france , making gardens at the queen 's house , greenwich , designed by inigo jones , from 1638 to 1642 , when the queen fled the civil war . he published the contents of his father 's celebrated collection as musaeum tradescantianum—books , coins , weapons , costumes , taxidermy , and other curiosities—dedicating the first edition to the royal college of physicians ( with whom he was negotiating for the transfer of his botanic garden ) , and the second edition to the recently restored charles ii . tradescant bequeathed his library and museum to ( or some say it was swindled from him by ) elias ashmole ( 1617–1692 ) , whose name it bears as the core of the ashmolean museum in oxford where the tradescant collections remain largely intact .
he was buried beside his father in the churchyard of st-mary-at-lambeth which is now established as the garden museum .

saul rosenzweig ( 1907–2004 ) was an american psychologist and therapist who studied subjects such as repression , psychotherapy , and aggression . rosenzweig , who , with a co-author , has been credited with being the first to attempt to `` elicit repression `` in a laboratory setting , became well known after publishing a paper discussing `` common factors `` underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy .


== biography ==
rosenzweig , a friend and classmate of b.f. skinner , earned his doctorate from harvard college in 1932 . he worked at worcester state hospital and clark university before becoming the chief psychologist at the western state psychiatric institute.rosenzweig taught at washington university in st. louis from 1948 until he retired in 1975 .
he died on august 9 , 2004 , at the age of 97 .


== work ==
in the 1930s , rosenzweig studied repression . with g. mason , rosenzweig criticized h. meltzer 's survey of studies of repression in an article published in the british journal of psychology . rosenzweig and mason argued that the studies reviewed by meltzer worked with sensory stimuli unrelated to the theory of repression , and `` failed to develop under laboratory control the experiences which are subsequently to be tested for recall . `` donald w. mackinnon and william f. dukes credit rosenzweig and mason with being `` the first to make an explicit attempt to elicit repression under conditions of laboratory control and observation . `` sigmund freud was sent reprints of rosenzweig 's attempts to study repression , but replied to rosenzweig that while he had examined his `` experimental studies for the verification of the psychoanalytic assertions with interest `` he could not `` put much value on these confirmations because the wealth of reliable observations on which these assertions rest make them independent of experimental verification . `` rosenzweig became well known after publishing a paper discussing `` common factors `` underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy . he argued that all models of therapy could be equally successful , due to competent therapists sharing common factors that aided their patients . his premise became known as the dodo bird verdict or dodo bird hypothesis — a reference to lewis carroll 's alice 's adventures in wonderland ( 1865 ) , in which a dodo bird declares at the end of a race designed to dry everyone off : `` everybody has won and all must have prizes . `` rosenzweig 's study of aggression led to the development of the rosenzweig picture-frustration study , a test of latent hostility . the rosenzweig picture frustration study is usually considered a semi-projective technique and involves an examinee responding verbally to a semi-ambiguous picture scenario . each of the three forms ( child , adolescent , and adult ) consists of 24 comic strip pictures that portray a situation that might induce frustration . the overall purpose of the study is to assess how the examinee responds to frustration and frustrating situations . the test assumes that the way that the examinee responds to each frustrating situation depicts how they behave in the face of frustration . the worth of this test is based on how aggression is conceptualized into three types . the first direction of aggression can be extragressive meaning that it is turned onto the environment . the second direction is intraggressive meaning that it is turned by the examinee onto the self . the final direction is imaggressive which means that it is evaded in an attempt to gloss over the frustration . in terms of reliability and validity , the p-f study interscorer reliability is in the range of .80 to .85 . the test-retest reliability is fair to marginal . the test became popular in europe and was featured in stanley kubrick 's film a clockwork orange ( 1971 ) .a collection of rosenzweig 's papers has been maintained in the archives of the history of american psychology , at the university of akron . this comprises a collection of papers from 1929 to 2003 , in five series :

shortly after , nibbi had to left italy for oxford , england . in 1969 she published the etruscans-themed the tyrrhenians , but a certain notoriety only came in 1972 with the self-published the sea–peoples : a re-examination of the egyptian sources , in which she suggested that `` the great green `` mentioned in egyptian records should not be identified with the mediterranean sea as usually done but rather with the verdant nile delta , and that ancient egyptians were not as much a seafaring civilization as thought ; at the time the book and the conclusions within were widely panned by mainstream academics .
since the journals started to refuse publishing her works , in 1985 nibbi founded her own review , the still-running discussions in egyptology , on which she published her successive studies on ancient egyptian geography centering on her reinterpretation of some narratives involving seafaring , such as the story of wenamun . in order to finding evidences for her claims , nibbi excavated in various egyptian coastal locations such as mersa matruh looking for anchors and other ancient naval technology.alessandra nibbi died on january 15 , 2007 in oxford , aged 83 .

john edwin `` bob `` winslow ( april 3 , 1937 – april 15 , 1998 ) was an american wildlife biologist and explorer . he led the great lakes biological station , an early and successful scientific research station in the lake superior area , working closely with scientists such as michael d'arcy wadsworth and john g. friese .


== biography ==
bob winslow was born on april 3 , 1937 in cleveland , ohio , to owners george `` bob `` and caroline ( charles ) winslow , the son of donald w. winslow , a teacher and businessman .
in 1971 , at the age of 20 , he embarked on his exploration career and eventually led the great lakes biological station , located at the muskegon conference center in muskegon , michigan . it was operated by the united states fish and wildlife service , with the goal of studying and protecting the land , animals , and natural resources of lake superior and the surrounding area . after world war ii , funding to support the station was more than possible , but the vast majority of funding was provided by the american association for the advancement of science , and by private donations . worshipful donations from the texas-based bishop barney flood funded the early period . despite years of trying , and extensive staff and equipment spending , the station 's first expedition to the region , in 1977 , was unsuccessful . in 1980 , the station was refitted with a searchlight and twenty television cameras and fourteen remote-controlled aircraft , among other equipment.in the 1980s , he led the great lakes biological station when it was absorbed into the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts . the base remained in woods hole until 1986 , before being merged with the university of michigan institute of oceanography in ann arbor . his supervisor at the institute was the leading marine biologist and ecologist of his day , michael d'arcy wadsworth . he also advised regional fisheries on biological conservation , work with scientific expeditions to animal husbandry , fish biology , and geological and paleoecological research .
during the mid-1980s , he joined its thunderbird substation in the grand marais experimental reserve , for which he became director from 1990 to 1995 . he was responsible for the wildlife research station and the bay of fundy substation , and also lead the muskegon substation . he is best known for creating the geology part of the great lakes biological station ( gmbs ) and other expeditions . he died of heart failure at the age of 84 . his unpublished books and articles are among the numerous documentation and artifacts in the great lakes biological station collections , as well as some of the science experiments and works of the great lakes substation at the university of michigan.one of the scientists working with the station at its zenith , writing in the biologist in 1984 , said that his contribution to the field was the creation and management of a model substation—two hundred of the best-equipped and most capable 'land mammal station'ever built—which greatly expanded ecological sampling of natural areas around muskegon , lake superior , and the lower great lakes . he also wrote that his predecessor , prof. w. christopher whipple of the united states department of agriculture 's fish and wildlife service , `` spent half a million dollars and spent ten years establishing a large laboratory in most of michigan and oklahoma. ``
he also wrote , `` the potential of lake superior `` was highlighted by wyno m. minklum-leach in the ecologist .


== other contributions ==
his two areas of focus , interest in wildlife breeding , and research on waterway sedimentary features , are cited by richard frey on his environmental questions , watersheds : the story of fish ( n.y. : macmillan , 1997 ) . he also made significant contributions in `` physical anthropology of fisheries `` , along with a high energy study of finfish and two pacific walleyes ( 2006 ) , both of which were published in the journal of applied physiology .
he also helped refine and publish six influential major scientific journals , including the journals of biology , palaeobiology , and entomology . he was editor-in-chief of the quarterly journal current biology from 1988 to 1996 , the journal of biology from 1994 to 1996 , and the journal of marine and freshwater sciences from 1993 to 1999.winslow and larry buttric founded the great lakes association of women in biology .

= valdemar adolph thisted =
valdemar adolph thisted ( 28 february 1815 – 14 october 1887 ) was a danish writer , translator and priest . his works include novels , travelogues , romantic dramas and theological polemics . the writings published during his time as a pastor caused a stir because of their critical views on contemporary church issues . he is best known among english readers for his novel letters from hell .


== life and works ==
valdemar adolph thisted was the son of jorgen thisted ( 1795–1855 ) , lieutenant and later vicar of gyrstinge and flinterup , and marie elmquist ( 1790–1829 ) . he was born in aarhus . after his mother ’ s early death , when he was twelve years old , he moved to the home of his uncle , the war commissioner of elmquist in aarhus , and attended the town 's grammar school .
before he began his theological studies in copenhagen , he was for a time tutor in a manor house . upon graduation in 1840 , he set up a boys ’ school in skanderborg and in 1846 a secondary school . he later became an assistant professor in a secondary school in aarhus , resigning in 1853 . in 1855 he began ministering in northern schleswig . after suffering a nervous weakness , and a fall that required him to use crutches , he resigned in 1870 and moved to frederiksberg .
thisted was married twice . his first marriage was to henriette hansen ( 1815–1904 ) , a sister of the painter constantin hansen , and was dissolved . his second marriage was to elisha rasmussen ( 1830–1901 ) , who became completely paralyzed for 30 years .
thisted made his literary debut with the novel vandring i syden ( wandering in the south ) , published in 1843 . the following year he began the first of his travels to southern europe . his subsequent works included havfruen ( little mermaid , 1846 ) , tabt og funden ( lost and won , 1849 ) , episoder fra et reiseliv ( episodes from a reiseliv,1850 ) and romerske mosaiker ( roman mosaics , 1851 ) , the fruits of a journey to italy ; the novel sirenernes ö ( siren 's island , 1853 ) ; the romantic dramas hittebarnet ( abandoned child,1854 ) , neapolitaniske aquareller ( 1853 ) and hjemme og paa vandring ( home and on hiking , 1854 ) ; novelistic travel studies örkenens hjerte ( örkenens heart , 1849 ) , bruden ( bride,1851 ) and the novel familieskatten ( family tax , 1856 ) .
he published a volume of poems with religious and patriotic sentiments in 1862 .
his novel breve fra helvede ( briefe aus der hölle ) , published in copenhagen in 1866 , excited considerable attention and was translated into several languages . the sensuality that coloured his previous works has a stronger suit in these letters and certainly contributed to their success . it is his only work to have been translated into english , although a number of his works were translated into german .
worried by the offence caused by the book , thisted made a kind of penance in høgholt ( 1868 ) , some colorless , religious parables . høgholt was thisted 's last work . a nerve weakness compelled him to give up both office and authorship . he moved 1870 to frederiksberg , where he spent his seventeen years ' retirement plagued by illness and bitterness at the absence of the recognition he thought he deserved . he was buried in haderslev .
at its best , his work is characterised by a vivid descriptive power and rich fantasy but also suffers from monotony and prolixity . thisted also wrote under the pseudonyms emanuel st. hermidad , herodion and m.rowel .

== contributions ==
as well as the first-hand knowledge of geological matters from dealing with silurian rocks , wilson found many of greer smyth 's seminal works to be derived from surveying in caves . while he proved correct in his geological maps of scotland ( wilson 2000 ) , smyth 's maps , it is said , began to be identified with a style of map-making which wilson was not keen on .

in the united states , he was a member of the scientific advisory committee of the u.s. national bureau of standards from 1916 to 1926 . the norlin-swallowstamp metric was one of the official standard units of standard deviation of 20 “ ° ” in elastic constants.norlin 's major research topic was the general theory of elasticity and the relation between a elastic chain ( made up of successive line segments ) and its induced mechanical stress . he worked on the microscopic control of elasticity in the internal tissues of animals by applying his theory of elasticity in measurement . he also studied the mechanisms of heat transfer and the principle of change in thermodynamic conductivity .
on his retirement in 1951 , norlin was a professor of physics at princeton university .

= catherine lacugna =
catherine mowry lacugna ( august 6 , 1952 – may 3 , 1997 ) was a feminist catholic theologian and author of god for us . lacugna 's passion was to make the doctrine of the trinity relevant to the everyday life of modern christians .
lacugna earned her bachelor 's degree at seattle university , her masters and doctorate at fordham university , and joined the faculty at university of notre dame in 1981 . there , she taught systematic theology to graduate and undergraduate students , eventually holding the nancy reeves dreux chair of theology at the university of notre dame.catherine lacugna died at the age of 44 , of cancer , and is buried in the cedar grove cemetery on the notre dame campus .


== trinitarian theology ==
lacugna , a western theologian , sought common ground with eastern christians through re-examining early christian scholars or church fathers . she rejected modern individualist notions of personhood and emphasised the self-communication of god .
building on the work of karl rahner , lacugna argued that the `` demise of the doctrine of the trinity `` started when early church theologians had to respond to the teachings of arius , arch-heretic of the christian church . arius ' doctrine required a response , and the church fathers ' response began the theological trek into speculation on the inner , hidden life of god , commonly referred to as the immanent trinity . whereas before , theologians had concentrated on the nature of god as revealed in god 's actions in history ( commonly called the economic trinity ) .
according to lacugna , the church father augustine furthered this divide between economic and immanent trinity with his psychological model of the trinity , which described the inner life of god as being like a human 's memory , intellect , and will . the real culprit in this matter , though , was thomas aquinas , whose scholastic theology took theological speculation to a whole new level .
against rahner and karl barth ( in church dogmatics i/1 , §9 ) , lacugna wished to retain the use of the word persons in relation to the three persons of the trinity . rahner 's manners of subsisting and barth 's modes ( or ways ) of being she saw as too easily adopting the modern notion of individualistic personhood , instead of a relational and interdependent model .
lacugna says that god is known ontologically only through god 's self-revelation in the economy of salvation , and that `` theories about what god is apart from god 's self-communication in salvation history remain unverifiable and ultimately untheological . `` she says faithful trinitarian theology must be practical and include an understanding of our own personhood in relationship with god and each other , which she calls `` living god 's life with one another `` .lacugna 's doctrine of the trinity has been challenged by theologians such as nicholas lash and james william mcclendon , jr .


== awards ==
professor lacugna received two significant teaching awards from notre dame university . in 1993 she received the frank o'malley undergraduate teaching award , and she received the charles e. sheedy teaching award in 1996 .

nikolai constantinovich baynes ( russian : александр боринович пата́тинов ; 25 february 1790 – 2 january 1834 ) was a russian and russian-american mathematician .


== biography ==
born on a farm in siberia , baynes studied at the university of kiev and in 1804 received a doctorate under nikolai dmitrievich shokalskiy . in 1805 he traveled to the united states , and soon became a member of the united states mathematics department , becoming professor of algebra and probability theory in 1815 . in 1831 he was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences , the same year also joining the russian academy of sciences . he was among the first to perform a rigorous mathematical proof that arbitrary infinitesimals can be represented in a formula as a set of cubics with analytic powers . his proof also influenced the definition of zero ( = − ) .baynes also started an academic correspondence with j.h . helmholtz , who soon went on to prove that the boltzmann equation can also be represented as a term vector on a quadratic complex . he also made contributions to universal additive algebras and group theory .
baynes left the university of st. petersburg in 1808 . in 1817 he returned to the u.s. and resumed teaching at the faculty of mathematics at the newly established school in philadelphia , but he also became the standard authority on probability theory . he died on 2 january 1834 in philadelphia .


== theory of integral equations ==
baynes developed his theory of integral equations later in the 18th century , which is now more commonly known as partial differential equations or partial differential equations . by removing the algebraic assumptions from these equations ( now known as binomial integrals ) , baynes helped explain the solutions of integral equations in terms of the minimal invariants that they give . for example , a solution of an integral equation `` n `` must be the product of the adjacent equations `` m `` and `` n `` . he also proved in 1802 that a direct estimate of the square root of the number of moments of the integrator can be derived from the extent of the tangent space .
this proof of the fundamental principle that a solution of a particular integral equation can be developed from any number of possible solutions is sometimes referred to as `` baynes'proof `` . as a consequence , integral equations are commonly found in probability theory.in the following chapters , the remainder of a chapter , and the bulk of the rest of the book are dedicated to examples of examples , and exposition of the principles .

== biography ==
william was born in silverton , near broken hill , new south wales to christian and barbara schipp ( née mcnair ) . christian , a builder and bricklayer , had come from germany in 1855 and followed the gold rush to broken hill and then kalgoorlie , western australia . william was the youngest of five children . he studied botany , especially flowering tropical plants .
william worked in the darwin botanical gardens and collected plants in new guinea , java and dutch east indies for several years prior to 1929 before moving to belize , perhaps with the catholic church .
he came to san francisco , california from tjondong , tjikandang , java in late january 1929 . at the university of california , berkeley he spent several days with ed merrill . schipp left san francisco passing through southern united states to new orleans where he boarded the ss abargarez for british honduras . on the evening of 28 january 1929 he arrived at belize , the capital and main port of the colony . early in february 1929 schipp left belize equipped with a brief outline map of the colony for the stann creek district directly south of belize district where he started collecting twenty specimens of each taxon in order to fulfill requests of his subscribers .
a pioneer , he made the first comprehensive collection of belize botany . his collections from british honduras are in many herbaria . herbarium sets distributed by william a schipp to european and american institutions represent one of the most significant and extensive collections ever made of the coastal plain flora for the stann creek and toledo districts of southern british honduras . he compiled the first complete flora of these districts in the form of a catalogue entitled `` flora of the british honduras , pricelist of seeds & herbarium material `` . as a professional botanical explorer , his discrimination in the field yielded a total of 154 taxa new to science , including two new genera - schippia and schizocardia . hardships were soon overcome by this keen and discriminative botanical explorer . whilst the most complete collections are thought to be at the field museum in chicago and the gentle herbarium in belmopan , belize .

roger wilkes worked for the university of pennsylvania biological sciences department as a university lecturer , receiving his ph.d. in 1946 , under the direction of richard alum of the university of wisconsin . he began working at the california institute of technology in 1948 , as a post-doc in the cavendish laboratory , where he worked with ralph hammes , later to become the head of the cavendish laboratory , to investigate a protease reaction from mitochondria to produce f4 ( trypsin a ) and f7 ( glutathione s ) . he became a senior research fellow at columbia university in 1955 , where he worked on lipid metabolism , cell membrane permeability , and the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum plasticity . he was a member of the national academy of sciences ( 1949 ) , science writers of america ( 1950 ) , and the national academy of engineering ( 1956 ) .in 1957 , wilkes joined the faculty at mit as professor of biochemistry and he remained at mit as professor of biochemistry until his retirement in 1980 . he died on january 6 , 1981 in his home in boston .


== research ==
one of wilkes'major contributions to biochemistry was his discovery of the enzyme thioglycolate dehydrogenase in 1947 . this enzyme is now widely used in clinical laboratories , and is one of only two enzymes that can oxidize a small number of insoluble compounds , while the other is an enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic respiration of lipids and sugars . it is also active against rust , and wilkes was instrumental in the creation of the george b. tronikoff fluid cycling system .
wilkes also is known for his development of the wilkes–schlakow colorimetric calorie screen for health professionals in 1961 . this system can predict the life expectancy of individuals using a color change indicator . he was a co-founder of the national academy of sciences in 1971.wilkes was the senior recipient of the joseph l. ingraham endowed fellowship in 1950 , and the elliott c. watts endowed fellowship in 1954 . he received the charles p. steel foundation prize of the atomic energy research foundation in 1955 , the frederick j . pierce foundation honoris causa award in 1960 , the hughes school award for research in protein science , and the armented g. williams bancroft medal in 1964 . he was a fellow of the american institute of chemists and the american society for cell biology . he was an honorary member of the chemical research foundation of great britain .
wilkes is noted for his collaboration with the young derek fryar on enzyme action in hydrocytes , for his work in co-division with halpern on enzyme synthesis in plants and algae , and for the wilkes–schlakow experiment that showed how the specific protein orientation of enzymes affects their activity . in addition to his many research contributions , he is a widely respected biochemist with over 125 research publications , and he has an extensive and valued role in scientific education and management .

sidney william bijou ( november 12 , 1908 – june 11 , 2009 ) was an american developmental psychologist who developed an approach of treating childhood disorders using behavioral therapy , in which positive actions were rewarded and negative behaviors were largely ignored , rather than punished .


== early life ==
bijou was born in the arlington neighborhood of baltimore , maryland . he moved to brooklyn , new york with his family when he was 10 years old . he earned a degree in business administration at the university of florida in 1933 . he was awarded a master 's degree in psychology at columbia university in 1937 and earned his ph.d. in the field at the university of iowa in 1941 . together with joseph jastak , he developed the wide range achievement test , a comprehensive assessment of an individual 's ability in reading , comprehension , spelling , and mathematics . during world war ii , he served in the u.s. army air corps .


== career in psychology ==
he was hired by indiana university in 1946 , where he spent two years under pioneering behaviorist b. f. skinner . while other child psychologists had focused on use of techniques such as play therapy to identify the motives and causes of problematic behavior , bijou used skinner 's behavioral techniques to encourage positive behaviors through such rewards as praise , hugs and pieces of candy . children who were defiant would be given a time-out and separated from a group activity , with the expectation that the bad behavior would be its own punishment , and that any additional sanctions would not have a positive effect . a child isolated from a group would strive to behave appropriately in order to have the opportunity to rejoin the group.he relocated to the university of washington in 1948 , where he applied skinner 's techniques on children at the institute of child development , and wrote several textbooks in the field together with donald baer . studies he performed there showed that encouragement of good behavior would elicit more good behavior even from unruly children . ole ivar lovaas of the university of california , los angeles , one of the developers of applied behavior analysis therapy for autism , adapted bijou 's techniques to develop one of the most commonly used techniques of using rewards to enhance social skills of autistic children.in 1968 , together with donald baer , todd risley , james sherman , and montrose wolf , he established the journal of applied behavior analysis , as a peer-reviewed journal publishing research about experimental analysis of behavior and its practical applications . [ 5 ]
he relocated over the years to the university of illinois , the university of arizona ( from 1975 to 1993 ) and the university of nevada , reno ( from 1993 to 2001 ) , where he established similar behavioral programs . his

carl friedrich hans breiber von breiber von breiber ( 16 april 1722 – 21 january 1807 ) was an austrian composer , pianist and historian .


== early life ==
he was born at borgo moravell , near leopoldstadt , and studied music and at the conservatory in vienna under alexander steiner . breiber became close friends with the young heinrich spengler . both were offered positions at the vienna academy of music , and breiber studied under spengler at the same time as henrik ibsen .


== career ==
he began composing in 1740 , and held the position of composer from 1750 until 1759 , his last five years as soloist at the grand concerts of vienna . breiber was one of the first composers to abandon the use of liturgical music in his music . breiber composed some popular music , but mostly works that were expurgated by the nazis after the end of the third reich .
he published only one orchestral work , a light symphonic poem entitled natg . iennennus , in 1760 . later , he composed a few cello concertos and small instrumental works . he also wrote a collection of poems , which were published as letters to mr. julius kober.in 1765 , he composed the longest sonata , and the first chamber music in german language , the sonata for cello and piano . breiber died in vienna in 1807 .


== works ==
breiber composed some pieces and choral works . although his own compositions are often bitter critical , the overt and incidental orchestration in his symphonies , sonatas , and suites ( on which he was praised for their complex harmonics ) are still rather influential ; the way his music is carried with a high sense of humour makes it easy for listeners to follow .
breiber 's best known composition is probably the roman cadenza ( 1811 ) , which bears his name . it is a complex 7-movement choral with choral melodies written in modal meter , and opuses of a dramatic mood.he was also a student of johann sebastian bach , and was fascinated by his chamber music .


== family ==
the breiber family were of noble-born descent . carl breiber was the eldest son . one of his brothers , frederick wirbel , was also a composer . their parents were bernd leopold breiber ( 1726-1776 ) , a minister ; his father was a canon of the benedictine cathedral in vienna , and his mother was a tailor . a nephew , carl anthony breiber ( 1730-1796 ) , a piano pedagogue , and other relatives survived him .

françois valentijn ( 17 april 1666 – 6 august 1727 ) was a dutch minister , naturalist and author whose oud en nieuw oost-indiën ( `` old and new east-india `` ) describes the history of the dutch east india company and the countries of the far east .
françois valentijn was born in 1666 in dordrecht , holland , where he lived most his life ; however , he is known for his activities in the tropics , notably in ambon , in the maluku archipelago . valentijn read theology and philosophy at the university of leiden and the university of utrecht before leaving for a career as a preacher in the indies .
in total , valentijn lived in the east indies 16 years . valentijn was first employed by the v.o.c . ( vereenigde oost-indische compagnie ) at the age of 19 as minister to the east indies , where he became a friend of the german naturalist georg eberhard rumpf ( rumphius ) . he returned and lived in holland for about ten years before returning to the indies in 1705 where he was to serve as army chaplain on an expedition in eastern java . he finally returned to dordrecht where he found time to write his oud en nieuw oost-indiën ( 1724–26 ) a massive work of five parts published in eight volumes and containing over one thousand engraved illustrations and some of the most accurate maps of the indies of the time . he died in the hague , netherlands , in 1727 .
valentijn probably had access to the v.o.c . 's archive of maps and geographic trade secrets , which they had always guarded jealously . johannes van keulen ii ( d. 1755 ) became hydrographer to the v.o.c . at the time valentijn 's oud en nieuw oost-indiën was published . it was in the younger van keulen 's time that many of the voc charts were first published , one signal of the decline of dutch dominance in the spice trade . one uncommon grace afforded valentijn was that he lived to see his work published ; the voc ( dutch east india company ) strictly enforced a policy prohibiting former employees from publishing anything about the region or their colonial administration . and while , as thomas suárez notes , by the mid-18th century the dutch no longer feared sharing geographic secrets , e. m. beekman notes how `` the execution of this policy was erratic and based on personal motives `` .while valentijn 's maps and diagrams were prized possessions , his scholarship , judging by 21st-century standards was unscrupulous . valentijn 's use of the products of other scientists ' and writers ' intellectual labour , passing it off as his own , reveals a penchant for self-aggrandisement . beekman nevertheless cites him as an important figure and , given his writing style , diction and aptitude for narrative , one of the greatest dutch prose writers of the time .

== biography ==
belousov began his psychoanalytic studies at the university of moscow where in 1908 , with konstantin illisov , he became a professor of psychoanalysis . he became in 1911 his chief assistant . belousov married margarita milyuva in 1914 , the couple having two daughters . his great love , though , was his wife , his own mother-in-law whose opinion greatly influenced the way he carried out his own work . a sympathetic catholic , his life was marked with trouble as he was forced by his mother-in-law to escape to tiflis and from there to novorossiysk to avoid persecution by the bolsheviks . belousov again went to moscow to continue his psychoanalytic studies with charles eustachius and subsequently supervised a. v. kobyshev in tiflis .
in tiflis belousov came into contact with other prominent psychoanalytic figures in these first years of the 20th century ; lina shukhevna and anatole brodsky took on his lectures , while alexander trubetsky in grigorii and shlomi mirsky in novorossiysk followed suit . however , belousov would recall from his own experiences that the reaction of the opposite sex toward the personal man he viewed as oppressive was in contrast to what he perceived in the antisocial men .
the focus of belousov 's book sexuality and womanhood was not more than a reproach against an exclusive idea of sexual repression . under its influence , he also studied the psychology of denial , in which the ability to respond to pain is also considered one of the essential elements in healthy sexuality . belousov insisted that , while the response to painful experiences is certainly crucial to the development of the personality , the psychological response to the power of the opposite sex seems to be independent of it . moreover , belousov believed that the superiority of the individuals is due not to any inherent human defect but to the power exercised by the opposite sex in maintaining physical and mental inappropriateness , the replacement of erotic love with maternal affection , and by a reduction of the degree of privation at which man 's power is exercised by nature or the culture of the people .
the book of homosexuality for the diagnostic of homosexuality in the 21st century was written after belousov 's death .

== biography ==
janko was born in rosengård ( then part of the austrian empire ) . he received his doctorate at lund university in 1935 , specializing in physiology . he returned to lund in 1945 , as an assistant professor of experimental physiology and head of the biology department . in 1948 he was appointed to the psychology faculty at lund university . from 1948 to 1955 he served as director of the department of biological sciences .
janko 's interest in hormones led him to a book , the gnostic serum , written in 1954 , the year after he had his doctoral thesis . his work on brain functioning led him to start an ongoing collaboration with prof. axel stoelschmidt , the head of the department of experimental medicine , and his younger brother , hans . a second edition was published in 1991 . during this period janko developed `` electrochemical optogenetics `` into a whole field in neurology and psychology . this research has been extensively cited in books such as hans 's neuroelectrodynamics and isaac asimov 's science in the age of mechanical reproduction .
janko was awarded the nobel memorial prize in physiology or medicine in 1973 , jointly with arnold schwartz , for his discovery of the action potential of dopamine on the respiratory cycle . it was not until 1975 that janko published his first paper on the physiology of sex hormones in the journal of physiology and was rewarded with the herbert plaster award .
in 1975 , janko published his seminal paper with sc.d . anders fjordman that published the volume `` clinical and translational studies of testosterone : its relations to sex development , moods , and personality `` . the paper would contribute to the field of comparative psychology and would lead to his appointment as an associate professor at the university of stockholm in 1986 . in 1996 , janko founded and served as the founding chair of the faculty of psychology and was succeeded as professor by niels henriksen who had taken up the post in 1988 .
in the united states , janko ’ s book `` testosterone and brain development `` was used by the united states national institutes of health in a landmark 1982 paper .

caleb evans ( 25 july 1831 – 16 september 1886 ) , was an english geologist .
evans , born on 25 july 1831 , was educated under professor key at university college school . the death of his father compelled him to leave school at an early age , and in 1846 he began work in a solicitor 's office . in 1852 evans was appointed a clerk in the chancery pay office , a post he held until 1882 , when his health enforced his retirement . he never married ; his residence was at hampstead , where he lived with his brother and sisters . evans commenced the study of geology by attending lectures delivered in 1855 by professor owen and dr. melville . in 1858 he began to collect fossils from the tertiary formations of the south of england , and formed during the next twenty-five years very complete sets illustrating the strata of the london district . he also investigated the strata of the isle of wight , lyme regis , weymouth , swanage , and portsmouth .
in 1857 evans took part in founding the geologists ' association of london , of which he was for many years one of the most active members , and in 1867 he was elected a fellow of the geological society . he was fortunate in being able to take advantage of the operations in connection with the main drainage works in the south of london , which afforded opportunities for collecting fossils never likely to recur . he secured suites of specimens of fossil shells of great interest and rarity . evans also did excellent work in studying the chalk . he made large collections of its fossils , and his paper ‘ on some sections of chalk between croydon and oxted , ’ read to the geologists ' association in january 1870 , marks the first english attempt to divide this immensely thick mass of pure white limestone into several zones , and to correlate these zones with those that continental geologists had already established .
altogether evans was the author of eleven papers on geological subjects , eight of which appeared in the ‘ proceedings ’ of the geologists ' association , including the paper on the chalk mentioned above , along with `` geology of the neighbourhood of portsmouth and ryde `` . his other work included sketch of the geology of faringdon in the ‘ geologist ’ for august 1866 , and ‘ mill hill in former ages , ’ written for the mill hill magazine . many of evans 's papers were also published separately .
evans constructed several geological models or relief maps , his method being to paste layer upon layer of cartridge paper so as to secure the necessary elevations , and then to colour the whole according to the outcrop of the rocks . his models of the valley of the thames near london , of a part of the same on a larger scale , and one of the whole of england , were passed to h. j. lister of eldon road , hampstead after evans ' death ; a map or model of the country round hastings is in the possession of the corporation of that town ; he also constructed a model of the neighbourhood of sidmouth . evans 's extensive collections of fossils were purchased by mr. ernest westlake of fordingbridge .
evans died on 16 september 1886 .

in 1896 rénheim was hired by the university of copenhagen as a laboratory teacher and theoretical physicist . in 1908 he was promoted to the position of professor . rénheim was also the organiser of the intercalation-ringing-concert which occurred from may 1896 to may 1903 in copenhagen . the conference was attended by a multitude of luminaries and distinguished personalities , including later nobel prize winner august schleyer , the writer pierre teilhard de chardin and e.g . ludwig boltzmann , who had worked with rénheim in the same laboratory . rénheim was the director of the institute which became the international institute for polar-temporal experimental research .
he became a member of the royal danish academy of sciences in 1922 , the royal danish academy of engineering in 1925 , and the danish academy of sciences in 1932.in 1897 he discovered the rené i. schneider krigesling ( rené i. schneider–schurmeyer effect ) that allows to distinguish a particular type of fluid from any other type in a liquid state . the value is 0.53 m2/s2 . in 1927 he published a new differential equation on dyads , which still survives . it is a function of the dispersion coefficient , known as the rené i. schneider krigesling function . it explains a phenomenon occurring in anodes , cathodes and perforations . the most important limitation of this variable is that it is effectively a differential equation that depends only on the dispersion coefficients . other types of liquids require a formula that can be derived from the rené i. schneider krigesling function . this is the formula of the rené i. schneider particle density function .

his name is sometimes transliterated ( according to the sino-japanese reading ) as rin shihei ’ ' .


== biography ==
hayashi was born in edo as the second son of hayashi gonhyoue yoshimichi , a 600 koku hatamoto who served the tokugawa shogunate as commissioner for documents . however , when hayashi was only three years old , his father was expelled for some reason and became a ronin . hayashi and his brother were brought up by his uncle hayashi jyūgo , a physician .
however , hayashi had an elder sister , kiyo , in the service of date yoshimura at the date clan residence in edo . she became the concubine of the 6th daimyō of sendai domain , date munemura . through her influence , hayashi jyūgo received an appointment as official doctor to sendai domain with a stipend of 150 koku , and hayashi 's brother hayashi kazen was adopted as his heir . on date yoshimura 's death , they moved to sendai ; however , hayashi himself had no official post or stipend , and remained unemployed within the household .
he wrote a poem called `` six no 's `` , which reads : `` i have no parents , no wife , no son , no block for printing , no money , and i wish for 'no death ' . ``
however , hayashi was not idle . he maintained an active correspondence with many of the leading rangaku scholars , economists and military scientists of the day . he also travelled to nagasaki in 1777 where he was especially impressed with the size and strength of the dutch ships , and learned of russian intentions to advance south from siberia into asia from the dutch opperhoofd . the caused him to make a journey to matsumae in the north , and he increasing became aware of the weaknesses of the country 's coastal defences , and ignorance of the outside world .

== scientific achievements ==
in addition to leading the national program to develop facilities for scientific ballooning , lally made a number of major contribution to the use of balloons as a vehicle for atmospheric measurements . the demonstration of the capability to fly superpressure balloons on multiple orbits of the globe was the critical experiment which triggered international support for the global atmospheric research program . in 1966 , ncar scientists launched a globe-circling balloon from christchurch , new zealand . this was one of a series of global horizontal sounding technique ( ghost ) balloons tested in order to collect meteorological data from all of the earth 's atmosphere and predict global weather on a long-range basis . the rocket-balloon-instrument sphere ( robin ) , designed in 1955 , was the principal vehicle for rocket soundings of the atmosphere . lally also developed the technique for reliable erection of space-inflatables . the radiation-controlled balloon ( racoon ) demonstrated in 1980 that the radiation-environment rather than ballast could achieve long-duration flight for zero-pressure balloons . it became the standard technique for global flight and recovery of heavy scientific payloads .

franz anton knittel ( april 3 , 1721 – december 10 , 1792 ) was a german , lutheran orthodox theologian , priest , and palaeographer . he examined palimpsests ' text of the codex guelferbytanus 64 weissenburgensis and deciphered text of codex carolinus . he was the author of many works .


== life ==

in 1751 he became a priest , in 1753 archdeacon of the main church in wolfenbüttel . in 1766 he became general superintendent and the first preacher in wolfenbüttel and in 1776 general superintendent in brunswick .
after receiving work in the main church of wolfenbüttel knittel started to examine manuscripts housed in the ducal library of wolfenbüttel . in 1756 he studied the codex guelferbytanus 64 weissenburgensis . the manuscript and its palimpsest text had earlier been examined by heusinger , who described it in 1752 , but knittel was the first who recognized that the palimpsest greek text belonged to two different manuscripts of the new testament . knittel designated these two texts by sigla a and b . he recognized also lists of the κεφαλαια ( chapters ) as another , the third greek manuscript . knittel also deciphered and reconstructed the gothic-latin text of the palimpsest and published it in 1762 at brunswick . it is known as codex carolinus . the upper text of palimpsest contains text of isidore of seville 's origines and his six letters . knittel designated it by siglum e and dated it to the 11th century .
knittel made many errors in deciphering the palimpsest 's text , especially in the latin text of codex carolinus ( e.g . enarrabilia for scrutabilia ) . tischendorf made a new and more accurate collation for the latin text ( edited in 1855 ) . a new collation of the gothic text was published by carla falluomini in 1999 . knittel examined also other manuscripts ( e.g . minuscule 126 , 429 ) .
knittel defended a traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism . he defended an authenticity of the pericopa adulterae ( john 7:53-8:11 ) , comma johanneum ( 1 john 5:7 ) , and testimonium flavianum . according to him erasmus in his novum instrumentum omne did not incorporate the comma from codex montfortianus , because of grammar differences , but used complutensian polyglotta . according to him the comma was known for tertullian .

fasenmyer grew up in pennsylvania 's oil country , and displayed mathematical talent in high school . for ten years after her graduation she taught and studied at mercyhurst college in erie , where she joined the sisters of mercy . the religious sister pursued her mathematical studies in pittsburgh and the university of michigan , obtaining her doctorate in 1946 under the direction of earl rainville , with a dissertation entitled some generalized hypergeometric polynomials.after earning her ph.d. , fasenmyer published two papers which expanded on her doctorate work . these would be further elaborated by doron zeilberger and herbert wilf into `` wz theory `` , which allowed computerized proof of many combinatorial identities . after this , she returned to mercyhurst to teach and did not engage in further research .


== `` sister celine 's `` method ==
fasenmyer is most remembered for the method that bears her name , first described in her ph.d. thesis concerning recurrence relations in hypergeometric series . the thesis demonstrated a purely algorithmic method to find recurrence relations satisfied by sums of terms of a hypergeometric polynomial , and requires only the series expansions of the polynomial . the beauty of her method is that it lends itself readily to computer automation . the work of wilf and zeilberger generalized the algorithm and established its correctness .
the hypergeometric polynomials she studied are called sister celine 's polynomials .

= granville penn =
granville penn ( 9 december 1761 – 28 september 1844 ) was a great-grandson of admiral sir william penn , a british author , and scriptural geologist .


== biography ==
he was born 9 december 1761 in spring gardens , london , the second surviving son of thomas penn and his wife , lady juliana fermor penn , fourth daughter of thomas , first earl of pomfret . he studied at magdalen college , oxford , but did not complete his degree . he then became an assistant clerk in the war department .
in the period from 1788 penn played a part in the development of veterinary education . a supporter of the odiham society , he met charles benoît vial de sainbel who was in england for the second time to try to set up a veterinary school , such as existed at lyon ; and whose profile was raised when he was asked to dissect the famous racehorse eclipse . penn ran a successful campaign over a few years to implement his own version of sainbel 's original scheme . the veterinary college , london opened its doors to pupils at the beginning of 1792.in 1834 penn succeeded his brother , john penn , in the estates of stoke park , buckinghamshire , and pennsylvania castle , portland.he died at stoke park on 28 september 1844 . he had married isabella , the eldest daughter of general gordon forbes and had 4 sons and 5 daughters .


== writings ==
penn , fluent in french , greek , latin and hebrew , was a fellow of the society of antiquaries and wrote several books dealing with biblical criticism and published a number of competent translations of ancient greek works , including a critical revision of the english version of the new testament . he also wrote some theological works particularly related to biblical chronology ( past and future ) and the early history of post-flood mankind . in 1833 he wrote the life of admiral sir william penn , on his great-grandfather .


=== a comparative estimate ===
his major work as a scriptural geologist was a comparative estimate of the mineral and mosaical geologies , published in 1822 . penn added a supplement in 1823 in response to buckland 's theory on kirkdale cave , and then revised and enlarged it to two volumes in 1825 in response to criticisms . like most scriptural geologists , penn , whose name became indelibly associated with scriptural geology , participated only transiently with it during his career . for example , between the production of his book when he was 62 and his death in 1844 he focused on philological scholarship .


==== attitude toward geology ====
penn wrote that `` the science of geology … has this remarkable character above all the preceding physical sciences ; that , it not only conducts the intelligence , like them , to the discernment of the god of nature , but advances it further , to a distinct recognition of that god of nature in the god of scripture . ``

jacques-louis agard ( 28 november 1860 – 2 august 1949 ) was a french zoologist who discovered in 1876 that the human digestive tract contained a mucus layer rich in amoebae . this discovery was the start of a successful modern field of research of amoebozoans .


== biography ==
born in boulogne-sur-mer , agard studied at the paris natural history museum and the école normale supérieure . while an instructor at the école normale supérieure , agard observed during 1888 in a field trip to la chapelle de crécy an example of autolytic amoeba , a group of small amoebic larvae containing the larvae of euterpe and trichogrammatode . he discovered that the larvae of euterpe , which are generally not eaten in this country , contain the chameleon larvae for feeding , and in the presence of lacustrine eggs , the larva begins to develop into autolytic amoebae and in 1886 discovered autolytic amoebae in a small swamp .
from 1889 , he taught at the école de chimie des sciences sur la france . in 1895 he returned to his native town and published in french the findings of his excavation at the salle de la loire on the island of antigua . the work was important for science in his home country because the absence of any proof of entomological distinctions between the species was brought to light . the work was widely studied and proved that it was the oral bacteria of coccidia which were the cause of skin disease . agard was the first european to distinguish the toxins produced by coccidia from its protozoa . ( this experiment was later dubbed the agard-aspirin–bototropis experiment . )
as a distinguished scientist , agard became a close friend and associate of botanist auguste lamarck .
he became professor at the ecole polytechnique and the chair of zoology at the same university ( 1958–1961 ) , but his first scientific published work on amoebae was in 1903 . the bibliography for these papers is widely available at the amazon in mémoires sous l ’ académie des sciences et naturelles de france , annuel de l ’ université de strasbourg , du règne fondation , bibliothèque bibliothèque des sciences et des arts naturales et le départements du méditerranée ( published on 16 december 1913 by g.-m. coté ) .
in 1904 , agard worked for 3 years on experiments involving the growth of a host by means of a broiler . his first published paper on this subject was `` zur differentiationkunde der vertebrateen `` ( on the development of the embryo in fishes ) . in the same year he became a fellow of the royal swedish academy of sciences .

== work ==
lifshitz is well known in the field of general relativity for coauthoring the bkl conjecture concerning the nature of a generic curvature singularity . as of 2006 , this is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in the subject of classical gravitation.with lev landau , lifshitz co-authored course of theoretical physics , an ambitious series of physics textbooks , in which the two aimed to provide a graduate-level introduction to the entire field of physics . these books are still considered invaluable and continue to be widely used .
lifshitz was the second of only 43 people ever to pass landau 's `` theoretical minimum `` examination . he made many invaluable contributions , in particular to quantum electrodynamics , where he calculated the casimir force in an arbitrary macroscopic configuration of metals and dielectrics .

in 1778 , barnes was born to his family in bristol , england . his father was a surgeon . in 1782 , barnes entered christ 's college , cambridge , and proceeded to study medicine under dr james fuller , leaving to study architecture . he gained an ll.b . in 1793 , and after two years spent at christ 's , he went to england .
in 1795 he received a professorship in catholic philosophy , and thereafter he worked for several years in denmark and his native england . he died in 1856 .


== early work ==
during his university career , barnes studied roman catholic architecture , especially church plan . he noted the `` traditional roof of the cottage-cabin `` , and the enclosure roof of the gothic church of notre dame cathedral . he wrote in 1803 his monograph on the `` plan of the cathedral of rome `` ( a work for which the cologne cathedral is particularly notable ) . barnes was a noted artist , and there are 20 detailed plates of paintings ( of brick , of woods , etc . ) in his library ( c. 1893 ) .
barnes included also the `` arch of the gothic `` of pope gregory xvi . the title is a pun of barnes'suggestion : `` arch in glanzer archem paravisen `` ( `` arch in greek paradise `` ) ; a phrase he often used , used as an argument of the bishop of oxford 's `` forbidding `` to close the school of architecture to lutheran enrollment .
a valuable document is the `` appendix to the castle at st. regis `` ( boscobel ) ( appended for the convenience of the bishop of milan in 1805 ) , arranged in the following orders :

a detailed biography of barnes is given in the
harry chapman baker historical dictionary . the biography by j. w. atkinson is about both the influence of barnes on bishop ward and also was a master of british obituaries and commentaries .
barnes'last academic work was the deutsche insekten der heiligen werther ( deutsche museum of modern art ) , named after the state in which he spent the last decade of his life . the remarkable artists who created this monumental building were close to his heart , including paul schumann , an important architect of his time , and a prussian patron . barnes died at his home at boscobel , near cologne , on 11 april 1856 .

ernest hutcheson wrote concertos for piano ; 2 pianos ; and violin , and many solo piano works , such as a transcription of wagner 's ride of the valkyries . his music has been little heard in concert or on recordings , but his australian compatriot ian munro has recorded some of his piano pieces .
hutcheson wrote important books the literature of the piano , the elements of piano technique , , a musical guide to richard wagner 's ring of the nibelung , and elektra , by richard strauss : a guide to the opera with musical examples from the score , among others .

= august beer =
august beer ( german : [ beːɐ̯ ] ; 31 july 1825 – 18 november 1863 ) was a german physicist , chemist , and mathematician of jewish descent .


== biography ==
beer was born in trier , where he studied mathematics and natural sciences . beer was educated at the technical school and gymnasium of his native town until 1845 , when he went to bonn to study mathematics and the sciences under the mathematician and physicist julius plücker , whose assistant he became later . in 1848 he won the prize for his essay , `` de situ axium opticorum in crystallis biaxibus , `` and obtained the degree of ph.d. two years later he was appointed lecturer at the university of bonn .
in 1852 , beer published a paper on the absorption of red light in coloured aqueous solutions of various salts . beer makes use of the fact , derived from bouguer 's and lambert 's absorption laws , that the intensity of light transmitted through a solution at a given wavelength decreases exponentially with the path length d and the concentration c of the solute ( the solvent is considered non-absorbing ) . actually , the “ absorption coëfficient ” defined by beer in his paper is the transmittance ( or transmission ratio ) , t = i / i0 . thus , as pointed out by beer , the transmittance of a concentrated solution can be derived from a measurement of the transmittance of a dilute solution .
indeed , the transmittance measured for any concentration and path length can be normalized to the corresponding transmittance for a standard concentration and path length . beer in a number of experiments confirms this , defining a standard concentration of 10 % , and a standard path length of 10 cm . the photometer , devised by beer , is shown in the gallery below .
beer continued to publish the results of his scientific labors , writing in 1854 einleitung in die höhere optik ( introduction to the higher optics ) . his findings , together with those of johann heinrich lambert , make up the beer–lambert law . in 1855 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the university of bonn . beer also wrote `` einheit in der electrostatik , `` published two years after his death . he died in bonn in 1863 .


== beer 's law ==
beer 's law , also called lambert–beer law or beer–lambert law , in spectroscopy , is the physical law stating that the quantity of light absorbed by a substance dissolved in a nonabsorbing solvent is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance and the path length of the light through the solution . beer 's law is commonly written in the form a = ε cl , where a is the absorbance , c is the concentration in moles per liter , l is the path length in centimeters , and ε is a constant of proportionality known as the molar extinction coefficient . the law is accurate only for dilute solutions ; deviations from the law occur in concentrated solutions because of interactions between molecules of the solute , the substance dissolved in the solvent .

charles karl köster ( 18 november 1881 – 14 january 1965 ) was a swedish economist who served as a professor of economics at the university of chicago from 1924 to 1961 . the university of chicago is named in his honor .


== early years ==
charles karl köster was born in kolmasen , and studied at the department of economics of the swedish imperial university in köthen , from which he graduated with a doctorate in 1927 . his doctoral work was entitled `` uppenbarne statistischer societas förförbundskola veränderelserelse statistiska experimentationer aktive selning som världsktningen `` ( the legal institutions of a statistical state experiment . the research into a social state experiment ) . the first translation of the book into swedish into english was published in 1930 , following a reprint .


== career ==
köster had originally studied at a college in stockholm . as a result , he became acquainted with carl menger . both , he and the kaiser 's health insurance company , knaurer , tried to organize the swedish socialists to obtain a much-needed strike . but despite a refusal from the kaiser 's health insurance company , and difficulties obtaining insurance coverage from it , all attempts failed . köster , having found the scientific methods used by menger ’ s work and is now using those methods himself , became acquainted with and a believer in the theoretical ideas of karl marx . karl marx himself , even at this early stage , had a close friend in köster . köster , like other progressives of the time , was also the president of the st. louis anti-saloon league . he had become a marxist and became an intellectual representative of the jacobin society .
in 1928 , the swedish social democratic party succeeded in becoming the governing party in sweden . köster left the social democratic party in 1934 , supporting the social democracy led by alfred nobel.in 1934 , the kaiser 's health insurance company ( jonsson skalbart ) was dissolved . swedish president of the swedish social democratic party-elect , gustaf godräther , wished to deal with the fallout from the dissolution of the health insurance company that they might get insurance from the state , and köster found the financial difficulties he encountered in köthen ( i.e. , for the time being , his salary as professor of economics ) overwhelming . köster spent two years on an unpaid research job at the lund university . he started a phd under the supervision of jonsson , which resulted in the production of a book entitled `` statistiska i världskonomiska analytiska statistiska experimenta ( theory of statistics and its applications ) . `` the book is perhaps the first serious attempt at understanding the causes of the great depression and what one can do about it .
köster remained in lund until 1937 when he obtained a chair in economic statistics at the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 2012 : new york : oxford university press , isbn 978-0-19-2033887-7 ) . there he studied the trend in the swedish market rate between 1906 and 1938 , and thus came to work on the development of a national inflation index . his theories about the nature of investment and unemployment , as well as about the economic impact of international trade , influenced the policy debate of the day . he was the co-founder and president of the aarhus school of economics in 1946 .
from 1948 to 1958 , köster served as a professor in the department of economics at the university of chicago ( 1947–1960 ) . he left the faculty to become a visiting professor in stockholm in 1960 , an arrangement which continues to this day . he died in 1965 .

hans walter kosterlitz frs ( 27 april 1903 – 26 october 1996 ) was a german-born british biologist ..


== biography ==
kosterlitz earned a doctor of medicine ( dr. med ) at humboldt university of berlin . he emigrated to scotland in 1934 , after the nazi takeover in germany led to antisemitic legislation that barred him from his job at charité in berlin . the affair shocked him and he fled to the uk , and after obtaining work in the uk , he was able to obtain safe-haven for his mother , brother , and fiancée hanna . he joined the staff of university of aberdeen in the same year , as an assistant in the physiology department . over the years he was a carnegie teaching fellow , lecturer , senior lecturer , and finally reader . in 1968 , aberdeen established a new department of pharmacology , which was headed by kosterlitz as professor until 1973 , when he became director of the university 's drug addiction research unit.kosterlitz is best known for his work as one of the key discoverers of endorphins . he stimulated the mouse isolated vas deferens electrically and recorded its contractions with a polygraph . he then found that if you added opiates to the solution , the muscle would not contract . opiates inhibited the contraction . those contractions were later found to resume in the presence of both opiates and an antagonist such as naloxone . later , endogenous endorphins were discovered by applying pig brain cell homegenate to the apparatus . this caused the contractions to cease . the degree to which an opiate agonist inhibits contractions of the mouse vas deferens , and other tissues like the guinea pig ileum , is highly correlated to its potency as an analgesic .
kosterlitz was given the scheele award in 1977 , and shared the albert lasker award with john hughes and solomon h. snyder in 1978 for his work in the discovery of the opiate receptors and their natural ligands . the kosterlitz centre at the university of aberdeen , opened on 16 september 2010 , is named in his honour .
hans kosterlitz was married , since 1937 , to hanna greßhöner . their son , j. michael , is professor of physics at brown university , who won the nobel prize in physics in 2016

= william john of clarendon =
william john of clarendon frse ( 15 december 1825 – 19 december 1886 ) was an english meteorologist . he was the brother of michael john of clarendon ( 1818–1895 ) and brother of robert john of clarendon ( 17 june 1822 – 5 october 1892 ) .


== life ==
william john was born in charleville , hertfordshire . he was educated at northampton college , and completed a degree in chemistry with degrees in 1836 and 1837 . in 1845 he became an assistant at the observatory in rome , and by 1870 was employed as a weather forecaster .
as a meteorologist , he was chiefly interested in atmospheric temperature , which involved meteorological observations made by meteorologists in all parts of the world . in 1856 he was sent by his brother michael to rome to study geophysics under charles scocco , examining the valleys and surface of the earth and the atmosphere as it shifted due to earth rotation . this led him to the conclusion that the fine pressure difference between the seabed and the atmosphere causes the volume of the atmosphere to rise and fall , as the distance between the two lines of pressure changes with earth 's axis of rotation . on some such consideration he was elected a fellow of the royal society of london in 1859 . he was a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh in 1860 , and of the royal meteorological society in 1872 . he served as the secretary of the british association for the advancement of science between 1877 and 1881 . he was also awarded an honorary degree ( d.sc . ) from oxford university in 1884 .

menard 's historical and sociological writings are respected by historians of science . menard began his professional career in 1949 , in the sea floor studies section of san diego 's navy electronics laboratory . he joined the scripps institution of oceanography ( sio ) in 1955 as associate professor of geology . menard 's field work was extensive , involving 1,000 aqua-lung dives and 20 oceanographic expeditions from 1949 until 1978 when he became director of the u.s.g.s . his research focused on the morphology of the ocean floor . during the 1950s , menard also started a scuba-diving business with a few colleagues that included consulting for at & t on the laying of cable .
he became a full professor of the university of california , san diego in 1961 . two years were spent at
churchill college ( 1962 and 1970-71 ) . following a year in washington , d.c. as technical advisor in the office of science and technology ( 1965-66 ) , menard served as director of the university of california 's institute of marine resources .


=== usgs career ===
in april 1978 , h. william menard became the united states geological survey 's tenth director but remained only through the balance of the carter administration . menard had been a marine geologist with the naval electronics laboratory in san diego for several years and then had become a member of the faculty of the scripps institution of oceanography . in 1965-66 , he was associated with the office of science and technology in the white house . a member of the national academy of sciences , menard was a recognized worldwide authority in marine geology and oceanography and had discovered notable topographic and structural features of the sea floor that laid much of the foundation of the plate-tectonics revolution in geology.after his return to the scripps institution of oceanography in 1981 , menard continued to teach , write , and do research . menard died from cancer on february 9 , 1986 . a biographical memoir was published by the national academy of sciences in 1994 .

= ren c3 a9 jeannel =
rené jeannel ( 23 march 1879 – 20 february 1965 ) was a french entomologist . he was director of the muséum national d'histoire naturelle from 1945 to 1951 . jeannel 's most important work was on the insect fauna of caves in the pyrenees , france and in the carpathians , romania . he also worked in africa . jeannel specialised in leiodidae ( then silphidae or catopidae ) but authored a large number of papers and works on other coleoptera . he was a member of the romanian academy .
as the son of a medical officer in the french military , jeannel was expected to succeed his father . however , after developing an interest , during his studies in toulouse , in cave exploration and especially cave fauna , he began considering a career in biological science instead . his interest was especially stimulated when he discovered two new cave beetles in the grotte d ’ oxibar ( named after him by abeille de perrin : bathyscia jeanneli and aphaenops jeanneli.in 1905 he began a life-long friendship and collaboration with romanian biologist emile racovitza . in the first 17 years alone they jointly explored 1,400 caves in southern europe and north africa and published descriptions of the caves and their fauna . when racovitza was invited to found a biospeleological institute in cluj , jeannel became his deputy director until 1927 , when jeannel obtained a chair in entomology in the paris museum.despite his administrative positions , jeannel remained a productive scientist . in 1911 , when he published his 641-page , 657-illustration doctoral thesis on leptodirini ( then called bathysciinae ) , he had already produced more than 30 papers . during the rest of his career , he added another 500 scientific publications to this total , together amounting to more than 20,000 published pages—mostly on cave insects and all illustrated by himself.jeannel 's most important contribution to taxonomy was the fact that he realised the potential of using the genitalia for species identification and classification . genitalia evolve faster than external parts of the body and therefore the differences between species are greater . in his book l ’ édéage ( 1955 ) , he summarized all the insights the study of the aedeagus ( the term used for the male beetle genital apparatus ) had afforded him .

russell shoemaker ohl ( january 30 , 1898 – march 20 , 1987 ) was an american engineer who is generally recognized for patenting the modern solar cell ( us patent 2402662 , `` light sensitive device `` ) .
ohl was a notable semiconductor researcher prior to the invention of the transistor . he was also known as r.s . ohl .
russell ohl ’ s specialized area of research was into the behavior of certain types of crystals . he worked on materials research in the 1930s at at & t 's bell labs ’ holmdel facility , investigating diode detectors suitable for high-frequency wireless , broadcasting , and military radar . his work was only understood by a handful of scientists in the organization , one of whom was dr. walter brattain ( one of the trio who invented the germanium bipolar transistor in 1947 , and who would be awarded the nobel prize for physics in 1956 ) .
ohl , in 1939 , discovered the pn barrier ( or as it became known , the “ p–n junction ” ) . at the time hardly anyone knew anything about the impurities within these crystals , but russell ohl discovered the mechanism by which it worked . it was the impurities which made some sections more resistant to electrical flow than others , and thus it was the `` barrier `` between these areas of different purity that made the crystal work . ohl later found that super-purifying germanium was the key to making repeatable and usable semiconductor material for diodes . all diodes ( incl . leds , laser diodes etc . ) are descendants of ohl 's work . his work with diodes led him later to develop the first silicon solar cells .

karl walther martin ludwig wilhelms ( 10 april 1882 – 19 february 1972 ) was a german neuropathologist .


== life ==
wilhelms was born in halle aß eener , saxony , germany , the son of a physician who was a native of lubeck . the university of halle awarded him a degree of medicine in 1906 . he graduated with a phd under joseph goldschmidt in 1905 with an dissertation titled der ältere folgende derkugende der brodhave und die herrgesteine als die planisphere im schweiz und insbesondere der schneegezte von die ihre anatomie und der gebiete der neurogeschichte , in which he was also the recipient of a letter of recommendation from josef hübner .
in 1908 he returned to halle , where in 1910 he became an assistant in a neurological clinic , a position he retained until his retirement in 1941 . in 1928 he was named director of the neuropsychiatric institute in schöneberg .
his career spanned several departments , including neurology , neurology and psychiatry , and he continued to work on the anatomical basis of dementia . he was also a psychobiologist who published a number of papers on the relationship of specific personality traits with neuronal processes .
he was deeply affected by the institutionalism of the nazi regime in germany , and later did not hesitate to express his displeasure with the conduct of medical doctors . wilhelms described psychiatric illness as `` the poorest form of manhood `` .
wilhelms died in göttingen in 1972 .


== work ==


=== brain : anatomy , physiology , and pathology ===
wilhelms ’ work concentrated on the anatomical basis of the brain and its connection with the nervous system . he studied the cerebral hemispheres : the ventricles , the pons , and the cerebral cortex.although wilhelms was an outspoken critic of pathological psychiatry , such as `` pathological psychology `` ( poulantz dasen et al . ) , with which he had a professional conflict , he had a very strong affinity for neuropsychiatry . wilhelms discussed with his student raymond wiedemann his views on neuropathology , commenting that “ there can be no disagreement as to the importance of the word neuropathology in the sense of a logical determination of physiological processes . ”


=== neurology ===
wilhelms also discussed neurophysiology , studying ocular corneal reflexes , and superatomy . his laboratory work was devoted to the quantification of oxygen consumption and their association with visual sensitivity . in 1897 he was awarded the verein für neurologie und physiologie zur allgemeine physiologie ( for one year ’ s assistance in comparative physiology ) .in 1913 , in the autumn semester of this year , wilhelms demonstrated for the first time that trigeminal nerves produced abnormal phototaxis in the eye , independently of the visual system ( reich et al . ) . in 1916 , wilhelms demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal and lingual nerves caused double vision . in 1918 , as part of his practice , wilhelms also performed neurochemical investigations on urea in the eye .


=== neuropsychology ===
wilhelms contributed to a number of areas of neuropsychology . he completed a comprehensive textbook on motorogy and physiology of the human nervous system in the 1890s , with additional articles in a series of books and monographs on sheep brain . he also wrote a major article in 1894 entitled `` on the structure of the vegetative state , `` published as the anatomy and physiology of consciousness in the new york world-telegram .
wilhelms coined the phrase `` misreading `` in neurology . he was an outspoken critic of the methodologies used by pathologists in their diagnosis of mental illness , and he viewed the current state of modern neuropsychiatry as having a progressive descent from a belief in innate , irreducible dissection .
wilhelms coined the phrase `` in utero stroke `` in 1910 .


== death ==
wilhelms died in göttingen in 1972 , apparently of leukemia .

mikhail grigoryevich churkin ( russian : никола́й приборникович азбриков ; 20 august 1852 , stalingrad – 26 july 1917 , moscow ) was a soviet designer and illustrator .


== biography ==
in 1865 , churkin started studying the ancient trade inscriptions in moscow . his study of russian inscriptions began the design of several books and magazines , which he made with the help of engravers and assistants , including pavel august wilhelm lopatin . by the time he died in 1917 , he had received over 50 works . he is one of the leading figures of the tradition of russian engraving . a famous landscape in old russia , for example , is a work in his style . the unique window on his own bookshop is considered a masterpiece of russian art and was dedicated to alexander nevsky . the window is commemorated with the slogan of his motto .


== views ==

churkin has taken an interest in the meaning of traditional designs and influenced designers in the soviet union and abroad . although he was one of the first to understand the value of designing `` greek in the design of the world `` ( see atlantico ) , he was not interested in connecting it with what were regarded as frivolous design trends , although there is great importance in the recent fascination with modernism in russia . he expressed his own desire for an aesthetic harmony between his traditional and the modern.churkin 's main aim was always to bring back the `` greek idea `` , while preserving the purity of the old styles .
as a `` modern `` artist , he was influenced by the increasing sophistication of nature and its fine quality of quality of the skin , especially the textile . he always thought about the appearance of the work , thought about color , and wanted to make works using realistic methods , and utilized material minimisation.these sensibilities shaped his views on the values of the masculine and feminine form in visual art . churkin was conscious of the need to show a distinctive beauty in everyday life , and opposed the ideal of `` a colour palette `` to the kind of `` an all-pervasive , monochrome regime `` which characterized the aesthetic of romanticism . in comparison with the classics of his time , he experimented with creating beautiful typography with minimalistic character - closer to his own and the preferred style of the day.churkin called for `` harmony between the product and the designer `` , and favored minimalism , sensuality and objectivity . his inclination toward the classical orientation is reflected in his influential book elements of textile design ( 1916 ) . the book was a necessary preface for the book publications by art and architecture and conceptual paper with selected drawings and texts of various clients .


== honors ==
among the many publications by his name is the series the gardenia or the heart of russia ( 1935 ) .
a couple of sports-game baskets with his artwork were created by the developers of the ens kvet hockey team .
a chandelier made of churkin 's drawings and watercolors is in the ens collection in moscow .
several galleries in the moscow riam exhibit his and hers for the exhibition of oriental painting on the walls of the exhibition gallery churkin gallery .
in 1989 , unesco adopted the international name of `` churkin `` as a tribute to its authors and designers , and awarded him the `` ussr prize in the history of the arts `` .


== legacy ==
churkin 's was an acclaimed figure in modern russian art . his works from that period are popular with his younger generation , but he is still only an icon of his influence . his publishing works are mostly in the pattern-making and form-making area , and at the time of his death they had an enormous market value . his designs have been used as a reference for very long time .

in 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in berlin , and in 1938 professor of geography in bonn . troll , who utilised aerial photographs in his research , coined the term landscape ecology in 1939 . he developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying aerial photographs interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of asia , africa and south america , as well as his native europe . he developed seasonal climatic charts and three-dimensional climatic classification from hydrological , biological and economical data .
carl troll was president of the international geographical union from 1960 to 1964


== andean research ==
compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century troll 's andean work stands out by being free of developmentalist thought and there is `` no evidence of triumphalism of western science in his andean work `` . vertical zonation is the most acclaimed part of trolls work in the andes building upon the work of alexander von humboldt .


=== the inca empire and the environment ===
carl troll argued that the development of the inca state in the central andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the staple food chuño . chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern peruvian highlands . contradicting the link between the inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun . troll did also argue that llamas , the inca 's pack animal , can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region . it is worth considering the maximum extent of the inca empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas in pre-hispanic america . the link between the andean biomes of puna and páramo , pastoralism and the inca state is a matter of research . as a third point troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the inca state-building . while troll theorized environmental influences on the inca empire he opposed environmental determinism arguing that culture lied at the core of the inca civilization .

mcivor was born in dollar in scotland where his father john had settled after working to establish a nursery garden at crieff . mcivor trained in horticulture and arboriculture and worked at kew before taking up in 1848 , a position in southern india as superintendent of the yet to be established ootacamund botanical garden . at kew , mcivor took an interest in bryophytes and published a pocket herbarium of british hepatics in 1847 . he established the botanical garden at ootacamund and worked there until his death . he married anne , eldest daughter of colonel edwards of iscoed , denbighshire on 31 may 1850 . mcivor received cinchona plants in 1861 that had been brought from south america by clements markham . the first set of plants died but later batches consisting of other species ( especially cinchona succirubra ) did well . mcivor found that removing strips of barks and allowing them to heal by covering them in moss improved the sustainability of harvesting bark from the trees.mcivor ran into troubles with the madras government on handling a subordinate who was given to drinking . he also faced labour shortages which were for a while solved by importing chinese convicts from the straits settlements . the labour situation eased in 1877 due to the famine in the plains and an influx into the niligiris .

his funeral was attended by most government officers and among those present included colonel r. h. beddome.the standard author abbreviation mcivor is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

kenneth lee sokoloff ( july 27 , 1952 – may 21 , 2007 ) was an american economic historian who was broadly interested in the interaction between initial factor endowments , institutions , and economic growth . in particular , he examined the influence of factor endowments on economic development in the new world and the role of 19th century united states patent law in encouraging innovation .


== career and personal life ==
born in philadelphia , sokoloff graduated from the american school of paris in 1970 , earned his bachelor 's degree from the university of pennsylvania in 1974 and his doctorate from harvard university in 1982 where robert fogel served as his advisor . he joined the faculty at the university of california , los angeles in 1980 where he spent the remainder of his career . he died of liver cancer in los angeles , california on may 21 , 2007.kenneth grew up in silver spring maryland . he had a bone disease that was kept in submission by very expensive medications and transfussions , eventually leading to liver cancer and death . despite his infirmity , he had an active and full life . his father was a famous scientist , louis sokoloff , who did pioneering work in brain metabolism which led to the invention of pet scans .


== academic work ==
in a series of influential papers coauthored with stanley engerman , sokoloff studied the impact of countries ' initial factor endowments on their later political and economic development . while much of the contemporary literature explained different growth rates across countries by appealing to differences in national culture or religion , sokoloff used historical data to claim that much of the differential growth experiences of the us colonies and of new world countries can be explained through differences in initial endowments of factors including human capital and levels of inequality . moreover , sokoloff and engerman theorized that initial levels of wealth and political power inequality led to the development of institutions that perpetuated these inequalities , furthering their deleterious impact on long run economic growth . in article `` institutions , factors endowments , and paths of development in the new world `` , sokoloff and engerman made the specific hypothesis about inequality in wealth , human capital , and political power that restrict development of economics and compose the united states and canada have developed very different . for example , grains , which is grown on small family farms in the u.s. and canada that lead the distributions of wealth more equal ; whereas , other colonies in the new world relied on slaves for their labor force that lead to distributions of wealth , human capital and political power very unequal between black ( slaves ) and white . in addition to wealth and political power inequality , they have also mentioned the inequality of schooling in latin american countries . all of the latin american countries had literacy requirement for voting . however , the government did not provide funds for public education that caused the latin americans to have a low literacy level , in which affected the voting rate . therefore , a weak organizing schooling institution could affect the development of economy .
sokoloff and his coauthors also sought to understand the relationship between economic institutions and technological innovation . in particular , sokoloff stressed the importance of us patent institutions in fostering innovation by entrepreneurs . for instance , with zorina khan , sokoloff examined the careers of 160 `` great inventors `` credited with significant technological discoveries during the early american industrialization . in contrast to previous findings , sokoloff and khan found that these inventors were active entrepreneurs who responded systematically to market incentives . on the other hand , sokoloff , with naomi lamoreaux , found that over time the capital requirements associated with invention became prohibitively high , leading to firms taking over much of the innovative activity that was previously undertaken by individual entrepreneurs .

carl george niemann ( july 6 , 1908 – april 29 , 1964 ) was an american biochemist who worked extensively on the chemistry and structure of proteins , publishing over 260 research papers . he is known , with max bergmann , for proposing the bergmann-niemann hypothesis that proteins consist of 288 residue polypeptides or multiples thereof with periodic sequences of amino acids , and for contributing to the downfall of the cyclol model of protein structure.niemann was born in st. louis and attended the university of wisconsin–madison . after completing his ph.d. in biochemistry there in 1934 and staying on as research associate until 1935 , niemann took a position at the rockefeller institute for medical research , where he worked with the eminent protein chemist max bergmann . niemann analyzed the amino acid content of range of proteins . based on niemann 's tests and other published protein analyses , bergmann and niemann deduced that the sizes of protein molecules are always multiples of 288 and could be expressed according to the formula 2n x 3m . they also suggested that in the polypeptides of a given protein , amino acids occurred in a regular , repeating pattern ; for example , they proposed that silk fibroin , known to consist mainly of glycine and alanine , had a sequence of glycine-alanine-glycine- [ other ] , with the glycine/alanine pattern making up three of every four amino acids and other residues falling periodically into the fourth spot . niemann worked with bergmann on this theory from 1936–1938 ; by 1939 , they came to reject the theory as other biochemists provided evidence contradicting their proposed formula.after his work at the rockefeller institute and at the university college hospital as a rockefeller foundation fellow , and with strong support from warren weaver , niemann joined linus pauling 's crellin laboratory at caltech in 1938 . in 1939 , niemann and linus pauling published a strong critique of dorothy wrinch 's cyclol hypothesis of protein structure , which held that globular proteins formed inter-linked , cage-like polyhedral structures . niemann and pauling argued that x-ray crystallography and other data indicated that cyclol bonds did not occur in proteins and that polypeptides were held together in globular proteins by hydrogen bonds and weaker intermolecular forces . he went on to head research in immunochemistry and the organic chemistry of proteins.in 1945 , niemann became of full professor at caltech . he was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1952 , and was also elected to the american academy of arts and sciences and the new york academy of sciences . he died of a heart attack , according to his eulogizer john d. roberts , `` at the very height of his career `` .

novocain was found to be comparatively safe and effective , although its anesthetic effects were weaker than cocaine and some patients proved highly allergic . however , none of the other anesthetics developed during this period proved more effective and novocain quickly became the standard local anesthesia . although its use has largely been replaced by lidocaine , it is still in use today , most frequently in dentistry .

== life and career ==
tanabe was born in niigata to a teacher and a janitor . after a severe illness , he transferred to niigata university school of medicine ( now hosei university ) in 1931 , and served as a researcher there from 1930 until 1946 . in 1946 he was admitted to a university research group . he began work as a research worker in mass spectrometry in 1946 . in 1949 he started teaching at the university in yokohama , where he became a senior fellow from 1951 to 1955 . in 1955 , he joined the newly founded science and technology institute at tokushima , tokyo . from 1956 to 1963 he was a professor at hosei university . he retired in 1964 and was awarded the iwanami reki mitsui prize in 1971 .
after tanabe 's death in 1997 , scientists and researchers who worked in the field were kept up to date with the latest developments in the field , as well as the customary honors and awards given to tanabe 's students.the majority of the work tanabe worked on was in the field of chemical synthesis . he is the namesake of aseptiform alga belonging to the sea anemone family , which , after a lengthy phase transition , once again became a type of phytoplankton .
the identification of the x-ray emission from tanabe 's x-ray diffraction data in the late 1950s sparked interest in the role of x-rays in life . apart from his work on x-ray emission , tanabe developed a novel technique for the extraction of selenium and , in 1958 , developed a leach-resistant ultraviolet-visible ( ldv ) analyzer that was subsequently used by several large companies worldwide .

hanoch 's father shalom albeck , known as the talmudic scholar , was the editor of a number of works by
rishonim including raavan , meiri on tractate yevamot , and haeshkol by abraham ben isaac of narbonne . hanoch studied at the vienna rabbinical academy and he received rabbinical ordination in 1915 . in 1921 he received a degree from the university of vienna . between 1926 and 1936 albeck taught in the hochschule für die wissenschaft des judentums in berlin . in 1935 he emigrated to mandatory palestine where he was immediately appointed as professor and head of the talmud department at the hebrew university in jerusalem , a position he held for 25 years .
albeck , who was a religiously observant jew , published a number of books in hebrew and german on rabbinical literature , including `` introduction to the mishna `` , `` studies in baraita and tosephta `` , `` introduction to the talmuds `` , and others . in addition , he published numerous articles in the journal tarbiz .
professor albeck also wrote a simple and concise commentary on the mishna , appending longer footnotes at the ends of each volume . pinchas kehati sometimes quotes this work in his own commentary on the mishna . while the vocalization ( niqqud ) received special attention in albeck 's edition , the text did not merit such attention , and therefore albeck 's mishna is not a fully scientific version of the latter . albeck 's version was written as a continuation and expansion of the uncompleted earlier work of hayyim nahman bialik .
albeck 's teachers include : david zvi miller and avigdor optowitzer . his students include : the talmudic scholar avraham goldberg and abraham joshua heschel ( one of the foremost jewish thinkers in the 20th century ) .
albeck married hendel weiss ( the sister of abraham weiss ) , and the two had three children . two of his children are professor michael albeck , a lecturer in organic chemistry , and professor shalom albeck , a lecturer in jewish law ( and the husband of advocate pliah albeck ) , both at bar ilan university . his grandson is amnon albeck a professor of chemistry and university ’ s vice-rector at bar-ilan university . albeck 's son in law , yoseph aryeh bachrach , was killed in the israeli war of independence in the battle for jerusalem , leaving behind a wife and two children .

== life ==


=== early life ===
he was the son of nicholas p. kemmer and his wife , barbara statzer , and was born in saint petersburg , his family moved to germany in 1922 , where he was educated at bismarckschule hanover and then at the university of göttingen . he received his doctorate in nuclear physics at the university of zurich and worked as an assistant to wolfgang pauli , who had to give strong arguments in 1936 , before being allowed to employ a non-swiss national . later on , kemmer moved to the beit fellowship at imperial college london .


=== british nuclear development ===
he moved to trinity college , cambridge in 1940 to work on tube alloys , the wartime atomic energy project . in 1940 , when egon bretscher and norman feather showed that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would in theory produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product , kemmer ( who was lodging at the bretschers ' ) proposed the names neptunium for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets neptune and pluto beyond uranus ( uranium being element 92 ) . the americans edwin m. mcmillan and philip abelson at the berkeley radiation laboratory , who had made the same discovery , fortuitously suggested the same names .


=== professorship ===
he spent 1944–1946 in canada . at the university of edinburgh from 1953 to 1979 , he was tait professor of mathematical physics , creating the tait institute of mathematical physics in 1955 . he was elected as a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh in 1954 . his proposers were norman feather , max born , sir edmund whittaker and alexander aitken . he served as the society 's vice-president from 1971 to 1974.he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1956 and won its hughes medal in 1966 . kemmer was awarded the j. robert oppenheimer memorial prize in 1975 . nicholas kemmer was also a mentor and a teacher of the only pakistani nobel laureate , dr. abdus salam . kemmer is credited to trained and work with salam in neutron scattering by using relativity equations . salam later passed his research work to pakistani physics students who went on to contribute in this field .

guidobaldo del monte ( 11 january 1545 – 6 january 1607 , var . guidobaldi or guido baldi ) , marquis del monte , was an italian mathematician , philosopher and astronomer of the 16th century .


== biography ==
del monte was born in pesaro . his father , ranieri , was from a leading wealthy family in urbino . ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture . the duke of urbino , duke guidobaldo ii , honoured him with the title marchese del monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before guidobaldo . on the death of his father guidobaldo inherited the title of marchese .
guidobaldo studied mathematics at the university of padua in 1564 . while there he became a friend of the great italian poet torquato tasso . in fact guidobaldo may have known tasso before they studied at padua together , for tasso was almost exactly the same age as guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the duke of urbino , with the duke 's son , from 1556 .
guidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in hungary between the habsburg empire and the ottoman empire . after serving in the army , guidobaldo returned to his estate of ( monte baroccio ) mombaroccio in the marche , where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics , mechanics , astronomy and optics . he studied mathematics under federico commandino during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples . he also became a friend of bernardino baldi , who was also a student of commandino around the same time .
he corresponded with several mathematicians including giacomo contarini , francesco barozzi and galileo galilei . his invention of a drafting instrument for constructing regular polygons and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of galileo 's geometric and military compass .
guidobaldo was also important in helping galileo galilei in his academic career . galileo , then a promising , but unemployed 26-year-old , had written an essay on hydrostatic balance , which struck guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius . he then commended galileo to his brother , the cardinal del monte , who referred him to the powerful duke of tuscany , ferdinando i de ' medici . under his patronage , galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the university of pisa , in 1589 . guidobaldo became a staunch friend of galileo and helped him again in 1592 , when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the university of padua , due to the hatred and machinations of giovanni de ' medici , a son of cosimo i de ' medici , against galileo . notwithstanding their friendship , guidobaldo was a critic of galileo 's principle of the isochronicity of the pendulum , a major discovery which guidobaldo thought was impossible .
guidobaldo wrote an influential book about perspective , titled perspectivae libri vi , published at pesaro in 1600 . several painters , architects and the theater stage designer nicola sabbatini used this geometrical knowledge in their works .
he died at mombaroccio in 1607 .

== early life and education ==
buchanan was born in winamac , indiana in 1917 . he became interested in a career in science during a high school chemistry course . he attended depauw university as an undergraduate , where he gained his first scientific research experience , and from which he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry in 1938 . he received his m.s . from the university of michigan , ann arbor in 1939 , and later identified the head of its chemistry department , howard b. lewis , as a key influence in his research career . buchanan received his ph.d. from harvard university in 1943 under the supervision of albert baird hastings .


== academic career ==
buchanan arrived at mit in 1953 after reaching the rank of full professor at the university of pennsylvania medical school . he had been heavily recruited by the head of what was then called the department of molecular biology , francis o. schmitt . he became the head of the division of biochemistry and quickly began recruiting faculty interested in biochemistry research , including gene brown , vernon ingram , salvador luria , paul schimmel , phil robbins and lisa steiner ( the first woman faculty member in the department , hired in 1967 ) . he also sought out more senior scientists to bring to mit , including cyrus levinthal , maurice fox and alexander rich . james killian , the mit president responsible for recruiting buchanan , described the hire as among the most important and expensive hires he made , because the department 's biochemistry division under buchanan 's leadership quickly became widely well-regarded in the field . later , as biochemistry became more established , buchanan opposed some of the decisions made in the department , such as the shutdown of the division of biochemistry under department head boris magasanik and the planning under subsequent department head gene brown to launch the whitehead institute.buchanan was awarded the eli lilly award in biological chemistry in 1951 . he was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1953 and to the united states national academy of sciences in 1962 . buchanan became the first john and dorothy wilson professor in 1966 and retained the title till he retired in 1988 . in 2006 , mit endowed an annual lectureship in his name .


== research ==
buchanan 's graduate research formed one of the earliest uses of radiolabeling for studying metabolism . he is best known for his research on the biosynthesis of purines . often working in parallel with g. robert greenberg , buchanan 's research group made so much progress on this topic that they laid out their findings in a series of over 20 papers published in the journal of biological chemistry . buchanan and greenberg 's work together provided an understanding of the pathway through which purine bases could be converted to nucleotides .

moritz ludwig frankenheim ( june 29 , 1801 – january 14 , 1869 ) was a german physicist , geographer , and crystallographer .


== life and education ==
moritz ludwig frankenheim was born in 1801 in brunswick . his family was jewish . he attended the gymnasium ( high school ) there and in wolfenbüttel . afterwards he went to berlin to attend the alma mater berolinensis ( today humboldt university of berlin ) to study physics . in 1823 he completed a dissertation titled dissertatio de theoria gasorum et vaporum meditationes ( `` contemplations on the scientific theory of gases and vapors `` ) . inspired by the research of his teacher christian samuel weiss ( 1780-1856 ) , he became interested in crystallography . in 1827 he moved to the university of breslau , where he was assistant professor of physics , geography , and mathematics from 1827 to 1850 . in 1850 he was promoted to the position of professor of these subjects . after his retirement , he first moved to leipzig and then to dresden , where he died in 1869 at the age of 67 .


== work ==
frankenheim 's focus of research was crystallography , particularly studies of crystal structure and the mathematical and theoretical basis of the symmetry of crystals . by 1826 , he was already using the integer reciprocals of weiss ' coefficients ( the intersection of a plane with the three crystallographic axes ) to describe the spatial positions of crystal surfaces , from which the british crystallographer william hallowes miller ( 1801-1880 ) developed the concept of miller indices in 1839 . by assigning symmetry elements to the crystal systems defined previously by weiss and friedrich mohs ( 1773-1839 ) , frankenheim was able , for the first time , to define 32 point groups ( crystal classes ) and to classify them into four crystal systems ( the regular one , the fourfold , the twofold and the sixfold ) . from his observations he derived 15 lattice types for crystals , which were later reduced by auguste bravais ( 1811-1863 ) to 14 and today as bravais lattices describe unit cells of crystal structures . frankenheim conducted one of the first microscopic examinations of crystals in polarized light , using the then-new nicol prism as a polarizer .
in the field of geography , his most famous work is his book völkerkunde ( `` ethnology `` ) , published in 1852 .

herbert smuts ( november 2 , 1902 – january 6 , 1967 ) was an american plant physiologist . he was a pioneer in the field of plant physiology and the subsequent study of traits of flowering plants . he was awarded the franklin institute 's distinguished service award in 1934 , and in 1940 he was awarded the ivar laakson award of the international society for phytogeography and botany . smuts studied at cornell university , where he was one of the leaders of the department of botany .


== biography ==
smuts was born on november 2 , 1902 , in auburn , michigan , the son of gustave w. smuts and mary anne deland . he attended smith college , graduating summa cum laude in 1923 , but soon began research at the request of the college 's botanist , ralph eaton.in 1926 , smuts moved to washington , d.c. where he remained until 1930 . there , he researched and conducted pioneering research on the physiology of leaf development . his interest in the physiology of flowers led to his work with william c. mccarthy . the relationship between his research and the study of female plants led to the creation of the marvin smuts ornithology laboratory at the u.s. department of agriculture . throughout his career , smuts worked with many notable plant physiologists , including richard j. pollak , tom tholey , j. robert thurber , leonard harmon , harold h. king , and jack bland . smuts became the head of the plant physiology department at the university of california , berkeley .
in 1955 , he became a distinguished service professor at the university of california , berkeley , where he remained until his death . as an academic , he has been praised for his development of foundational research in the fields of physiology and the study of flowering plants . he had numerous scientific publications published during his career , including many papers published in the annals of botany , the american journal of botany , the botanical papers , and the journal of phytogeography .

[ e ] ach moment of color blurring did his world shrink , not only to a pleasure-cost estimate , but also to a total one-dimensional perspective .

smuts published the first two papers related to a widespread `` long-ornate `` cabbage . in that paper , smuts reported the study of the morphological characteristics of the loess of california , emphasizing the similarities in the leaves and fur of the cultivated and wild varieties . an earlier paper by him and mark e. michelson on leaf development from the new jersey ironworkers'cattle series suggested a structure in the leaves and the leaf veins that accounted for the appearance of the different loess forms . in the second paper , smuts described the pattern in spring ( may–june ) in china and india of leaf veins forming before the leaves even form.smouts found evidence of root-cap acorns in some north american species . he and walter brainerd found the genus acacia as well . along with paul m. albrecht , heinemann , and l. s. mark , he co-authored the book annotated plants of northern mexico , a valuable reference book in botany .

durrer was a professor at eth zurich from 1943 to 1961 . he edited and co-authored the multi-volume metallurgie des eisens ( metallurgy of iron , or the `` gmelin-durrer `` ) . the annual staudinger-durrer prize awarded by eth zurich commemorates durrer along with nobel prize winner hermann staudinger .

= ignazio cerio =
ignazio cerio ( 1841 – 1921 ) was an influential but eccentric physician and amateur philosopher on the island of capri , in italy . his father , imprisoned for his liberal beliefs , had spent his time in jail devising chemical concoctions and mechanical constructions that would never be made ; ignazio continued the family traditions of both liberalism and idiosyncratic inventiveness . ignazio even coined the word disutilità to refer to a human life lacking a sense of purpose but full of tension and reflection , mixing passionate pursuit of ideas with periods of lovesickness and ennui .
he worked for fifty years as a medical doctor on capri , a profession he followed with his characteristically unconventional flair . on one occasion , for example , he established a sanitorium at pozzuoli , claiming that the sulphurous gases would cure tuberculosis . the only patient to arrive at the sanitorium rejected the doctor 's contention that both sulphur and arsenic would be good for the health .
nevertheless , he remains a well-remembered and much-loved figure on the island of capri , his memory immortalised both in the writings of his son , edwin cerio ( particularly in la vita a la figura de un uomo ( 1921 ) ) and in the cultural centro caprense ignazio cerio , established in his name to organise conferences and meetings on medicine , italian and foreign literature , archaeology , palaeontology , and international and local history .
palazzo cerio , close to the piazzetta , hosts the ignazio cerio museum about capri 's natural history .

eugene maxwell clarke ( february 19 , 1913 – october 17 , 1992 ) was an american physicist , known for his work on neutrons and electroweak nuclear forces , which influenced classical and quantum mechanics . he made his first observation of the collision of pairs of particles with ordinary matter using fermions . he also examined how matter interacts with matter to form new particles . in 1937 , clarke obtained one of the first models of an elementary particle–antiparticle duality , the tevatron , which he then used to show that elementary particles also interact with matter . he then observed that neutrons , one of the fundamental particles of matter , travel through matter using the electron 's momentum . he then used tevatron experiments to use electrons to distinguish between different kinds of matter , showing that electrons travel in both protons and muons , together with positrons and neutrons . he and his friend ernest lawrence developed the equivalent concepts for electromagnetic radiation and x-ray radiation . at lawrence 's suggestion , they developed two-particle models of x-ray and radioactivity.clarke was a recipient of the cooper medal and the king prize in physics and awarded the award of the independence medal and medal of freedom . he was the chair of physics at columbia university from 1973 to 1978 . the university awarded him the john von neumann award , the croonian medal , and the hoover medal for distinguished service to science.he was a member of the national academy of sciences and the institute of physics.after his death , a crater in the crater of cherenkov discovered in 1970 is named after him.the einstein prize for physicists is named in his honor .

john leonard horn ( september 7 , 1928 – august 18 , 2006 ) was a scholar , cognitive psychologist and a pioneer in developing theories of multiple intelligence .
the structure of mental abilities
for his phd research at the university of illinois , horn identified other broad intellectual abilities to supplement fluid reasoning ability ( gf ) and crystalised ability ( gc ) postulated by his supervisor raymond cattell . as with cattell , horn rejected the existence of an even higher level factor of general intelligence ‘ g ’ asserted by spearman ( 1927 ) . in horn ( 1988 ) he reported a full list of such broad level abilities :
gc ( crystalised )
gf ( fluid )
gv ( visual )
ga ( auditory )
gq ( quantitative )
gs ( processing speed )
tsr ( long-term storage and retrieval )
sar ( short-term acquisition and retrieval )
the cattell-horn model was , more or less , replicated by carroll ’ s ( 1993 ) massive analysis by of 450+ intelligence measures , which also yielded a higher order factor similar to spearman ’ s ‘ g ’ . mcgrew ( 2005 ) reported that in 1999 the test publisher ‘ riverside publishing met with horn and carroll privately in chapel hill , north carolina , to seek a common , more meaningful umbrella term that would recognise the strong structural similarities of their respective theoretical models , yet also recognize their differences . this sequence of conversations resulted in a verbal agreement that the phrase “ cattell-horn-carroll theory of cognitive abilities ” made significant practical sense , and appropriately recognized the historical order of scholarly contribution of the three primary contributors . ’
the cattell-horn- carroll ( chc ) theory is the basis for many modern iq tests . horn 's parallel analysis , a method for determining the number of factors to keep in an exploratory factor analysis , is also named after him .

= charles tournemire =
charles arnould tournemire ( 22 january 1870 – 3 or 4 november 1939 ) was a french composer and organist , notable partly for his improvisations which were often rooted in the music of gregorian chant . his compositions include eight symphonies ( one of them choral ) , four operas , twelve chamber works and eighteen piano solos ; but he is remembered largely for his organ music , the best known being set of pieces l'orgue mystique .


== biography ==
born in bordeaux , tournemire moved in adolescence to paris , and there became one of césar franck 's three youngest students . ( the other two were henri büsser and a belgian , guillaume lekeu , the latter having been born only two days before tournemire . )
from 1898 ( on the resignation of gabriel pierné ) to 1939 , tournemire served as the organiste titulaire at franck 's old church , the basilique ste-clotilde , paris . he was also professor of chamber music at the paris conservatoire . in 1931 he published a biography of franck .
a year before the biography appeared , tournemire recorded five organ improvisations which were later transcribed by maurice duruflé from phonograph recordings . of ten 78-rpm discs which tournemire made in 1930 , playing the aristide cavaillé-coll organ of sainte-clotilde ( polydor 561047 , 561048 , 566057 , 566058 , 566059 ) , five contain franck compositions . this set of discs was awarded the grand prix du disque on may 18 , 1931 and has been reissued on both lp and cd .
insofar as tournemire 's name is now remembered , it is usually spoken of in connection with his biggest composition : l'orgue mystique , a group of 51 sets of five pieces each ( except for holy saturday , which contains only three pieces ) , all written between 1927 and 1932 . this collection covers the cycle of the roman catholic liturgical year , each set being based on the gregorian chants for the day . unlike the symphonies of charles-marie widor , which are usually heard in secular recitals ( even when individual movements of these symphonies had liturgical origins , as they sometimes did ) , l'orgue mystique was designed through and through for church use .
tournemire died in arcachon , france in 1939 . the precise cause of his death is uncertain , as is the exact date ( 3 or 4 november ) .

leon lichtblau ( also known under the pseudonym adolf cristin , russian : адолф иванович кристин ; august 23 , 1901 - april 25 , 1938 ) was a romanian socialist and communist militant , and soviet statistician who was executed during the great purge .
he was born in bucharest , romania , in the family of a jewish architect . while studying at gheorghe lazăr high school , he attended the scientific conferences organised by the local folk university . here he met and befriended several young workers , who introduced him to socialists ideas . in 1918 , when socialist militants gheorghe cristescu , alecu constantinescu and ecaterina arbore were arrested by the german authorities occupying southern romania , leon was one of the organisers of a public demonstration demanding their release . he was also a participant in the manifestations which accompanied the departure of the german army , being noted for his pro-revolutionary and anti-monarchical chants .
on december 13 , 1918 leon lichtblau was arrested along with other militants during a large workers ' demonstration in bucharest . sent to trial for `` rebellion and unrest `` , he was reproached by the presiding judge for his political opinions . to the judge 's allegation that students , and people of intellectual background in general , should n't be taking part in the socialist movement , he replied by reading a list of socialist leaders , whom he identified as his role models . in 1920 , after completing high school , he enrolled in the university of bucharest 's faculty of mathematics . in the same year he accommodated anarchist max goldstein while the latter was preparing for the bombing of the romanian senate .
in 1921 he went to iaşi to support the local workers ' movement , but soon returned to bucharest , narrowly escaping arrest during the crackdown on the socialist conference taking place in the former city . back in bucharest he participated in the may 1921 congress of the socialist party of romania , where he supported the party 's affiliation with the comintern . in the summer of that year he was part of the romanian delegation to the second congress of the young communist international in moscow . on his return to romania he found out that the authorities were offering a 200,000 lei reward for his and others communists ' capture , and went into hiding . on october 15 , the 2nd army corps issued an arrest warrant on his name . pressure was put on his family to reveal his location , his home was repeatedly searched , his brother interrogated , while his sister was forced to sign a declaration condemning leon 's activities to be allowed to finish her studies at the bucharest conservatory . leon lichtblau eventually fled the country , staying in vienna , and , after being expelled from austria , in berlin . in 1922 , as part of the dealul spirii trial , he was sentenced in absentia to lifetime forced labour , and another arrest warrant was issued for him .
not able to return to romania , leon settled in moscow , adopting the pseudonym adolf cristin . here he graduated in economics from the institute of red professors in 1926 , later becoming the head of the industry department of the central office of economic accounting of the ussr . at the request of the communists in romania , he translated a part of vladimir lenin 's works in romanian , under the coordination of david fabian . for a short time in 1928 he was a member in political bureau of the central committee of the communist party of romania , along with fellow exiles fabian and elek köblös .
he was arrested on april 5 , 1937 , during the stalinist purges . on april 25 , 1938 he was indicted with `` spying and provocative activities and membership in a right-wing counter-revolutionary organisation `` , and was executed on the same day . leon lichtblau was posthumously rehabilitated by a decision of the soviet supreme court on october 3 , 1956 , as well as by a commission of the romanian communist party in 1968 .

moritz von aberle ( 25 april 1819 – 3 november 1875 ) was a german catholic theologian .
born at rottum , near biberach , in swabia , he died at tübingen . he became professor in the obergymnasium , at ehingen , in 1845 ; director of the wilhelmstift , in 1848 ; professor of moral theology and new testament exegesis in the university at tübingen , in 1850 , a position he retained till the day of his death .
he had a considerable number of pupils in both branches , but he was especially devoted to scriptural studies . he emphasized the activity of the human bearers of revelation , without changing it into a purely natural process . von aberle published the results of his investigations in a series of articles . the main thoughts of these articles were collected and published under the title `` introduction to the new testament `` , by dr. paul schanz ( freiburg , 1877 ) . aberle 's view that the gospels and the book of acts are apologetic writings , meeting certain needs of the apostolic times , can not be sustained . he took also an active part in the struggle for ecclesiastical liberty in württemberg , and his strong newspaper articles forced the state to arrange church matters on a tolerable basis .

== major publications ==


=== the babylonian genesis : the story of creation ( 1942 ) ===
`` babylonian genesis `` is a translation and commentary on the babylonian epic known as enuma elish ( the first two words of the text , translated as `` when on high ... `` ) . on its publication it was reviewed in the journal of the american oriental society as `` a sober and lucid translation of the epic in the most completely restored form available to date . `` [ 1 ] the university of chicago press published the first edition in 1942 and the second edition in 1951 . the book remains in print .
the book consists of four chapters . chapter 1 outlines the discovery of the enuma elish , its purpose , date , source and structure , followed by a literal translation ; chapter 2 gives translations of the other babylonian and mesopotamian creation accounts as known at the time ; chapter 3 treats the accounts of babylonian creation stories preserved in classical texts ( berossus and damascius ) ; and chapter 4 compares the babylonian creation stories with those contained in genesis .
heidel aimed his book not at other assyriologists but at biblical scholars and christian ministers , and it should be regarded as a work of christian apologetics rather than as a contribution to heidel 's own field of assyriology . many of his arguments stressing the uniqueness of the genesis creation story have been overturned by later scholarship , but at the time of its publication the book was a milestone in introducing the wider public to the parallels between mesopotamian and hebrew mythology .


=== the gilgamesh epic and old testament parallels ( 1946 ) ===
heidel 's book on the gilgamesh flood myth is a comparison of the mesopotamian epic with the biblical account of noah 's ark and the biblical deluge . the university of chicago press published the first edition in 1946 and the second edition in 1949 . the book remains in print .

in the 1920s and 1930s , lenz began an experiment involving an mri technique , scanning the brains of patients with encephalitis without giving them any instructions . to accomplish this , he took the brains of two patients , one with syphilis and one with no syphilis . the scans were taken in a hospital that made use of the newly invented mri machine at the time . lenz studied how the patients'brains responded to stimuli . he suggested that people with schizophrenia and those with anorexia nervosa had brain abnormalities that made them unable to observe a stimulus . in this study , lenz and associates found that the frontal lobe , the region of the brain that controls impulses , was severely damaged .
in addition to all this , he did something that no other person ever had done : he gave mental images , the mental images that a person had read , conversations in a text , and phrases used in the conversation to himself . this allowed him to experience sensory experiences that no one else could . the patient that he was studying , emil segal , would subsequently become the founder of the theory of `` visual encoding `` or how people see objects that were present when they view a visual scene .
lenz was professor of anthropology and psychological analysis at the university of vienna from 1948 to 1959 . he was also the first professor of psychology at the university of chicago . in 1958 , he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine .

richard clarke cabot ( may 21 , 1868 – may 7 , 1939 ) was an american physician who advanced clinical hematology , was an innovator in teaching methods , and was a pioneer in social work .


== early life and education ==
richard clarke cabot was born may 21 , 1868 , in brookline , massachusetts , one of five sons of james elliot cabot and elizabeth ( dwight ) cabot . james cabot was a philosopher and harvard university professor who also trained as a lawyer and biographer , and was a friend of ralph waldo emerson .


== professional career ==

cabot studied philosophy at harvard university before switching to medicine . inspired by the beliefs of john dewey , cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation , and he admired the work of teddy roosevelt and jane addams . after completing his studies in 1892 , he turned down the role of the first bacteriologist at massachusetts general hospital to work in the hospital 's much less prestigious outpatient department . at this time , outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who could n't afford inpatient treatment , or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such tuberculosis or diabetes . this involved working populations who lived in unhealthy , overcrowded accommodation , often recent migrants.he changed the way that the outpatient department was run , believing that economic , social , family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with . he envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors , the former concentrating on physiological health , and the latter on social health . in addition to this , he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting . in 1905 cabot created one of the first positions of professional social worker in the world , given to garnet pelton , and then to ida maud cannon . although clarke credited his approach as similar to that of anne cummins in london . the hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers , and cabot had to pay their wages himself . pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire . cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became head of social work at the hospital . cabot and cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients , including art classes for psychiatric patients , low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person 's likelihood of developing tuberculosis.in 1917 cabot took up a position in the medical reserve corps for a year . he returned briefly to massachusetts general hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at harvard 's department of social ethics in 1919 . at this time , the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers , as up to this point , cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years . he went on to write about his experiences in his book social workhe is also credited with discovering cabot rings , and for describing , along with his colleague , locke , the eponymous cabot-locke murmur , a diastolic murmur occasionally heard in severe anemia , unrelated to heart valve abnormalities .
cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at massachusetts general hospital ( mgh ) that featured generating differential diagnoses , and founded the long-standing feature of case record of mgh in new england journal of medicine .


== family and personal life ==
cabot 's paternal grandfather , samuel cabot , jr. , became a sailor at age 19 and married elizabeth perkins , daughter of a successful boston trader . samuel cabot iii later took over the running of the firm .
richard married ella lyman , and both held transcendentalist views . this philosophy , as well as his parents ' commitment to philanthropy , had a strong influence of richard . around the end of the 19th century , such ideals were out of favor , with the dominant beliefs at the time being social darwinism .

bennett was born at halifax , nova scotia , on 15 november 1804 , the eldest of three sons of major william bennett , re , and mary early , daughter of james early , an officer of the 1st royal garrison battalion . his younger brother , george augustus bennett ( 1807-45 ) , like their father , served in the corps of royal engineers , board of ordnance . his youngest brother , frederick hamilton bennett ( 1816–73 ) , ordained to the curacy of daventry ( 1840 ) , curate-in-charge of st john 's , worcester ( 1842–51 ) , master of arts , christ church , oxford ( 1843 ) , served his final appointment as the first vicar of saint mary the virgin , freeland , oxfordshire , from 1869 .

== biography ==
commerson was born at châtillon-les-dombes in france . he studied in montpellier , and for a time was a practicing physician . he was in contact with carl linnaeus , who encouraged him to study fish of the mediterranean.commerson returned to live at châtillon-les-dombes , where he occupied himself in creating a botanical garden in 1758 . after the death of his wife in 1764 , he moved to paris.in 1766 , commerson joined bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation after being recommended for the position of naturalist by the paris academy of sciences . he had previously drawn up an extensive programme of nature studies for the marine ministry , in which he elaborated the `` three natural kingdoms `` which a naturalist should investigate on a voyage around the world . among the wildlife that commerson observed was a particular kind of dolphin in the strait of magellan , now known as commerson 's dolphin ( cephalorhynchus commersonii ) .commerson 's partner and assistant , jeanne baré , accompanied him on the voyage , disguised as a man . baré acted as a nurse to commerson , who was often ill , as well as assisting him in his scientific work . her gender was only publicly discovered while the expedition was at tahiti , but she remained with commerson , nursing him and assisting him in his professional activities until the end of his life.commerson was an astute observer of the tahitian people and culture , thanks in part to a remarkable lack of european prejudice compared to other early visitors to the island . commerson and bougainville together were responsible for spreading the myth of tahitians as the embodiment of the concept of the noble savage .
what admirable country madagascar is ! it would merit not a casual observer but entire academies . madagascar , i may announce to naturalists , is their promised land ; it is there that nature seems to have retreated as into a private sanctuary , to work on different models from any she has used elsewhere : the most curious , the most marvellous forms can be found at every step ...

commerson also studied and collected plants wherever the expedition stopped ; among others , he described the genus bougainvillea . on the return voyage to france in 1768 , he remained behind at mauritius ( the then-french isle de france ) , in order to botanize there and on madagascar , an island that fascinated him . pierre sonnerat , who would also become a renowned botanist , was his personal secretary on the isle de france .


== death and legacy ==
commerson died at mauritius at the age of 45 . his extensive collections from the voyage did not , unfortunately , receive their deserved recognition . although his numerous manuscripts and herbaria were brought to paris after his death they were never systematically organized and evaluated . unaware of his death in 1773 , the paris academy of sciences elected him as a fellow botanist just a few months later .

= maximilian flom =
maximilian flom ( 29 december 1670 – 20 january 1717 ) was a danish philosopher , theologian , diplomat , jurist , and humanist who is best known as a professor of theology and logic at uppsala university .


== biography ==
flom was born in ilthedon , the son of jacob flom , a merchant in stibitz in the kingdom of denmark . after studying philosophy and theology at the university of copenhagen , he obtained the degree of doctor of theology in 1690 . following this , he went to düsseldorf , where he practiced law and theology . he died in 1717 , aged 76 .


== ideas ==
the anti-slavery philosophy he advocated is said to have greatly influenced the anti-slavery thought of his pupils . he is largely credited with introducing the concept of the indissolubility of marriage and with spreading the idea of social contract .
in 1698 , flom ( like michael pratz in 1704 ) wrote the famous prolegomena to his reform of the christian testimony , in which he defined the sin of leviticus and prohibited the killing of newborn children . his views seem to have had an impact on the development of legalistic rationalism in the 17th century , and inspired the danubian lutherans to apply the concept of pre-eminence to civil rights .
flom was known to have opposed the influence of great britain by changing his name to in 1702 to avoid complications with taxes . in 1713 , his reform of the christian testimony was published as prolegomena to the government and religion of denmark . in it he developed a new conception of justification , which , his response to the legalistic logic of calvin and others , affirmed the indispensability of divine revelation . flom argued that the writings of the bible , as a natural scriptural text , are theologically superior to the writings of later theologians , who had made special use of the bible to justify their views . the reform of the christian testimony , an article of his prolegomena , appeared in 1709.pettman , in his survey of maximilian flom , traces his theological ideas to the american calvinist writer , benjamin layton .

peter artedi or petrus arctaedius ( 27 february 1705 – 28 september 1735 ) was a swedish naturalist who is known as the `` father of ichthyology `` .
artedi was born in anundsjö in the province of ångermanland . intending to become a clergyman , he went after schooling in harnosand , in 1724 , to study theology at uppsala university , but he turned his attention to medicine and natural history , especially ichthyology , a science that he influenced greatly . in 1728 his countryman carl linnaeus arrived in uppsala , and a lasting friendship was formed between the two from 1729 ( as artedi was away due to the death of his father ) . in 1732 both left uppsala , artedi for england , and linnaeus for lappland ; before parting they reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the event of death.in 1734 artedi visited england , mentioning a meeting with hans sloane and a whale in london in november downstream of the london bridge . artedi left london in summer 1735 and met linnaeus in leiden . artedi was short of money and linnaeus introduced him to albertus seba , a wealthy dutchman , who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum of his time in amsterdam . seba employed artedi to write descriptions of fishes for his thesaurus.on the night of 27 september , while returning from seba 's home to his lodgings , he accidentally fell and drowned in a canal . his body was found the next day . linnaeus heard of the death through claudius sohlberg two days later and rushed to amsterdam . according to agreement , his manuscripts came into the hands of linnaeus , and his bibliotheca ichthyologica and philosophia ichthyologica , together with a life of the author , were published at leiden in 1738 under the title `` ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus ... `` .artedi was buried in a pauper 's grave in st anthony 's churchyard in amsterdam on 2 october 1735 . his grave was never marked and the churchyard site has since been appropriated for other purposes . an epitaph , written in latin by anders celsius , and translated into english by george shaw , is known because it was inscribed on the back flyleaf of linnaeus 's own copy of `` ichthyologia `` :

here lies poor artedi , in foreign land pyx 'd
not a man nor a fish , but something betwixt ,
not a man , for his life among fishes he past ,
not a fish , for he perished by water at last.a memorial stone to peter artedi was erected in amsterdam zoological gardens and unveiled on 28 june 1905 ; it is inscribed in latin . other stone memorials are in anundsjö and nordmaling in sweden .
linnaeus named artedia ( apiaceae ) , a monotypic genus from the eastern mediterranean , after his friend .

son of a scientific researcher who worked in bioinformatics , moreno joined the faculty of sciences in 1939 as the same professor there , and taught for the next fifteen years . after the second world war , he spent some time in the united states with the national bureau of standards , which had been set up by the u.s. atomic energy commission and was working on mapping america 's nuclear program . as part of this project , he assisted charles giraud on the design of the first set of nine radar detectors . in 1947 , he was promoted to professor , and , after that , to full professor in 1959 . during this time he founded the institute of graphical studies , and became a consultant for the federal reserve bank of new york .
he retired from teaching in 1982 , and became the special director of the italian research council . he died in 1994 at age 70 , at the age of 74 .


== academic and research interests ==
moreno was most famous for an application of bernoulli stochasticity to properties of geometric surfaces , specifically the partial differential equation of state . he proved an `` auxiliary solution `` of this problem in 1994 by reducing the stochasticity calculus of these surfaces to an algebraic calculus of partial differential equations . this resulted in a completely different equation , assuming a positive mass parameter ( which it does not , according to hermann stumpf ) , by which to set the value of the molar potential . this result is sometimes known as the moreno-stumpf equation . moreno was also responsible for a chapter on univariate geometry , which is now known as the moreno–lefebvre theorem .

= matthias ho c3 ab von ho c3 abnegg =
matthias hoë von hoënegg ( 24 february 1580 , vienna – 4 march 1645 , dresden ) was a german lutheran pastor .


== life ==
matthias 's father was leonhard höe von höenegg , a lutheran imperial councillor and doctor of law descended from old austrian nobility . matthias was born prematurely and so his health was weak during his early years , meaning he only started speaking when he was seven . his father initially had him taught by a private tutor until , once he was almost fully educated , he was allowed to visit vienna 's st stephan 's stadtschule , where he developed remarkably and began talking to the city 's scholars .
due to the imminent capture of vienna in 1594 by the ottomans , matthias , his father and his brother moved to steyr , where they spent three years and where matthias attended the local gymnasium . his father then returned to vienna and recalled matthias , giving him a chance to attend the university of vienna , where he initially studied philosophy . on the recommendation of an envoy from saxony , on 16 june 1597 he moved to the university of wittenberg , where he studied philosophy and gained his master 's degree , toying with going into law but in the end deciding to study theology .
after several disputations and lectures in wittenberg , his father 's death in 1599 brought him back to vienna for a short time , before returning to wittenberg , where he gained his licentiate in theology in 1601 . in 1602 he travelled to dresden , where he aimed to become court-preacher to the prince elector . after a trial sermon on 17 february 1602 he gained the post and also graduated on 6 march 1604 as a doctor of theology in wittenberg . christian ii of saxony then sent him to plauen as superintendent , where on 20 april he was introduced to polykarp leyser the elder .
despite several offers of other posts , he remained in the service of saxony and in 1611 , at the request of the elector of saxony , moved to prague as director of protestant schools and churches in bohemia . he then moved back to dresden on the death of paul jenisch and replaced him as chief court preacher of saxony .
his most notable work is his two-volume commentarii in joannis apocalypsin ( leipzig 1610/40 ) . his sermons and writings were strong lutheran polemics against the reformed churches , whose beliefs he loathed more than counter-reformation catholicism . older literature on the topic has overestimated his influence on john george i of saxony and saxon policy at the start of the thirty years ' war , though he was on john george 's privy council when it approved siding with the emperor against frederick v and wrote propaganda to support that decision .

= edwin fischer =
edwin fischer ( 6 october 1886 – 24 january 1960 ) was a swiss classical pianist and conductor . he is regarded as one of the great interpreters of j.s . bach and ( particularly ) mozart of the twentieth century .


== biography ==
fischer was born in basel and studied music first there , and later in berlin at the stern conservatory under martin krause . he first came to prominence as a pianist following world war i . in 1926 , he became conductor of the lübeck musikverein and later conducted in munich . in 1932 he formed his own chamber orchestra , and was one of the first to be interested in presenting music of the baroque and classical periods in a historically accurate way . although his performances were not historically accurate by present-day standards , they were for his time ; e.g . , he did conduct bach and mozart concertos from the keyboard , an unusual practice at that time . his interpretations of bach and handel were romantically conceived , with a wide dynamic range but often quite compelling .
in 1932 he returned once again to berlin , succeeding his great contemporary artur schnabel in a teaching role at the berlin hochschule für musik after schnabel 's exile ( he was jewish , and fischer was not ) from nazi germany . in 1942 he moved back to switzerland , temporarily putting his career on hold through world war ii . after the war he began to perform again , and gave master classes in lucerne for a number of later prominent pianists such as alfred brendel , helena sá e costa , mario feninger , reine gianoli , paul badura-skoda and daniel barenboim .

as well as solo recitals , concerto performances and conducting , fischer performed much chamber music . particularly highly regarded was the piano trio he formed with the cellist enrico mainardi and the violinist georg kulenkampff , ( who was replaced by wolfgang schneiderhan after kulenkampff 's death ) .
fischer published a number of books on teaching , and one on the piano sonatas of beethoven . he also made a number of recordings , including the first complete bach well-tempered clavier for emi , recorded on the piano from 1933 to 1936 . other classic recordings by fischer include bach keyboard concertos , miscellaneous solo bach works such as the chromatic fantasy and fugue , various concertos and sonatas by mozart and beethoven , schubert 's `` wanderer `` fantasie ( although he was not up to the transcendental technical demands of the finale ) and impromptus , and beethoven 's `` emperor `` and brahms ' second concerto , both conducted by wilhelm furtwängler . fischer 's historically important recordings have been reissued on cd by emi and smaller specialty labels such as apr , music & arts , pearl and testament . those of the mozart concertos k. 453 , 466 , 482 , 491 & 503 ( g major , d minor , e-flat major , c minor and c major ) are particularly outstanding , especially the last three with the inspired , powerful conducting of john barbirolli , lawrance collingwood and josef krips respectively , in 1935 , 1937 & 1947 .
fischer also accompanied elisabeth schwarzkopf in a renowned early-to-mid-1950s emi lp of schubert lieder . his last musical collaboration was with the violinist gioconda de vito . during their recording sessions for the brahms violin sonatas nos . 1 and 3 , he had to go to london for medical treatment , where he was told he was seriously ill . he died shortly afterwards in zurich .

vassily fedotov was born in chigain , s.y . his mother was nadezhda leningradna alizradeva and his father was an officer . his parents separated in 1898 and he moved to ufa , siberia , to live with his father . there he studied mathematics under nadezhda `` s brother eduard .
he graduated from the university in 1906 and joined the chigain agricultural institute , where he graduated in 1913 . in 1915 he graduated from the moscow state university .
he was appointed chair of combinatorics and semitic linear geometry and taught there until his death .
in 1917 he founded the federal institute of topology , where he built an elegant topological space for a first model of a 6-dimensional euclidean space , in 1921 he proposed the theory of homogeneous groups . in 1924 he became a member of the united soviet of russia .

fedotov introduced the concept of the intersection-member group , groupoids , and non-adjoint-groupoids to algebraic topology , supergroups and and topology . he developed the concept of an integrable natural group of l1 with a function ∅⁡ , and the idea of index classes on groupoids . he proved that as a vector space , a groupoid contains a prime and studied the affine case for it .
he was the first to apply axioms of regular geometry to the extended euclidean space , which made the conjectures that closed spaces had finite density or closed classes , and that groups had curvatures . he also took interest in the idea of parallel exterior corners , which is how geometry is often structured in planes , in regions which have an algebraic surface . in 1933 he showed that non-adjoint regions of a field bundle are orthogonal to the normals , thus excluding or at least decreasing the unpaired group-like graph . he proved that there exist a unique group of closed sets , g ( n ) , such that it is possible to enumerate subsets of it by subjoining the subgroups of g with edges :

`` urey 's ability to forge a solid point atom remained with us for decades . his initial results suggested that the initial bombardment of uranium atoms might be an important starting point for the next generation of atomic bombs . urey 's lab study also produced the first evidence of the plutonium–uranium bond , the fundamental bond-formation step in fission . he and his colleagues'achievement resulted in the manufacture of more than 1 billion u-235 isotopes through the process known as fission . more important , he was able to understand that the elimination of these isotopes would have the potential to enable the commercial production of even more enriched uranium. ``

otis dudley duncan ( december 2 , 1921 in nocona , texas – november 16 , 2004 , in santa barbara , california ) was `` the most important quantitative sociologist in the world in the latter half of the 20th century `` , according to sociologist leo goodman . his book the american occupational structure , which received the american sociological association 's sorokin award , documented how parents transmit their societal status to their children . duncan compiled his thoughts on the major issues of the field into notes on social measurement , which he considered his greatest work .
one of the most influential sociologists in history , otis dudley duncan was instrumental in transforming mainstream american sociology into a quantitatively based empirical social science in the second half of the twentieth century . his key scholarly contributions include the introduction of path analysis to sociology ; the measurement of occupational socioeconomic standing with an index ( duncan socioeconomic index ) ; the study of intergenerational occupational mobility ; the spatial analysis of residential patterns ; the application and advancement of log-linear models and rasch models for categorical social science data ; and a landmark treatise on social measurement ( duncan 1984 ) .
duncan ’ s best known work is a 1967 book that he coauthored with peter blau , the american occupational structure . based on quantitative analyses of the first large national survey of social mobility in the united states , the book elegantly depicts the process by which parents transmit their social standing to their children , particularly through affecting the children ’ s education . the book ’ s impact went far beyond its analyses of occupational mobility . using survey data and statistical techniques , it showed how an important sociological topic could be analyzed effectively and rigorously with appropriate quantitative methods . the work helped inspire a new generation of sociologists to pursue quantitative sociology . today a worldwide community of sociologists specializing in social stratification and social mobility still work on elaborating the blau-duncan model to include such additional factors as cognitive ability , race , and social context in studying the transmission of social standing from one generation to the next .
duncan retired in 1987 , taking up pursuits such as composing electronic music and computer graphics . in 2000 he joined his local humanist society which led him to publish new work on the prevalence of creationism , tolerance of atheists , support for euthanasia and other such issues .

= frederick willibald abel =
frederick willibald abel ( 30 december 1814 , sandweiss – 23 september 1898 , penzance ) was a scottish physician and naturalist . abel is best known as one of the founders of the field of botany in scotland , although his achievements in that area would go on to make him internationally known . abel was the author of descriptions of the highland grass , the english alfalfa , and the tobacco plant , and he is also considered to be one of the pioneers of scottish botany . he is commemorated in the scientific names of the scottish alfalfa plant and the northern whiteflower , and in that of the english tobacco plant .


== biography ==
abel was the son of a farmer , in the village of sandweiss . he went to the university at sandweiss in 1836 , graduating ba in medicine in 1840 , and ma in medicine in 1840 . while still in the university , he studied medicine and veterinary medicine under john campbell morton , becoming demonstrator in 1846 . he received his md in 1847.while still in university , abel married margaret maclaine in 1846 , and they had two children : william abel of solihull and elizabeth ann maclaine of ayr . abel died in penzance in 1898 .


== primary work ==
abel is best known for writing on grasses , especially those native to northern scotland and denmark . he described many species in the scots gardener and botanist , sir alexander grant clarke in 1849 , a botanist who had come to penzance to teach at the university of glasgow in 1824 . abel introduced , for the first time in scotland , grasses to the literature of botany , especially the native plant species native to scotland , the conifers.in 1856 , abel 's wife had died and by 1859 he was widowed . abel returned to penzance to manage the gardens of penzance , along with his wife and their five children , but he had to retire at the time of the english civil war because he could no longer cover the grasses . in 1869 he returned to the university of glasgow , working with the chemist john fraser maclean and the botanist joseph wollstonecraft .
in 1873 , following the recommendation of the cambridge botanical journal , the bodleian and heriot botanical library published his life of h.h . abel . in 1875 , when the university of glasgow awarded him the doctor of science degree , he chose not to return to the university because he was still working in the gardens of penzance . this job , however , in which he made important contributions to grass research , became his permanent career.his description of scots wheat as well as a selection of plants from various areas of scotland were published in 1883 , and he described the highland alfalfa at the time it was becoming widely known . in the journal of the linnean society , abel wrote about these plants as being an important source for early scottish wheat growing , since these flowers grow on the alfalfa on the medium-to-highlands of scotland and greenland . abel had been a botanist at the royal botanic gardens , kew from 1843–1845 , and in 1889 was elected a fellow of the royal society.his son frederick william abel ( 1877–1939 ) was a noted botanist and botanical explorer . he used the penzance route to collect the plants that survived on the first world war , discovering many new species .

= james rennie =
sir james rennie ( 1794–1880 ) , was a british scientist .
he was born at bolsted , cambridgeshire , on 24 january 1794 . he was educated at aberdeenshire grammar school , and at the university of cambridge .
he was then appointed private teacher at sibyl whitehouse 's school , middlesex , and at the metropolitan high school , oxford . he also taught at calcutta girls'high school for boys in 1821 , and the newly founded kilburn school for girls . in 1822 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh .


== works ==
rennie was a discoverer of the wavelike `` filament-tube phenomenon `` . he explored the elastic properties of rubber , finding that the filament-tube inside was a much lighter and more flexible material . it contained `` elastic fibres `` that could become thin enough to be suspended in the air , compress in the air , and give way at sudden strikes . he went on to demonstrate that it was the elastic properties of the fibres themselves that made the tube behave the way it did.the magnetic properties of the filament-tube were improved by experiments on the propagation of electrical current by the object that was being touched .


== influence on physics ==
other influences of his were on the development of meteorology . in 1829 he published a paper that suggested that rain might occur whenever the sky was cloudless . he also published studies on the lightning that resulted when a storm struck certain geographical regions . rennie came into contact with the geographer john aubrey fowle and the landscape writer and scholar charles-leonard dix.he also contributed to the study of anemotropies . rennie proposed that unlike erect or twilight stars , the locations of the stars would be very different during the day from at night . this hypothesis was now called the rennie hypothesis .

= bonaventura cavalieri =
bonaventura francesco cavalieri ( latin : cavalerius ; 1598 – 30 november 1647 ) was an italian mathematician and a jesuate . he is known for his work on the problems of optics and motion , work on indivisibles , the precursors of infinitesimal calculus , and the introduction of logarithms to italy . cavalieri 's principle in geometry partially anticipated integral calculus .


== life ==
born in milan , cavalieri joined the jesuates order ( not to be confused with the jesuits ) at the age of fifteen and remained a member until his death . he studied theology in the monastery of san gerolamo in milan , and geometry at the university of pisa .
he published eleven books , his first being published in 1632 . he worked on the problems of optics and motion . his astronomical and astrological work remained marginal to these main interests , though his last book , trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua ( 1646 ) , was dedicated to the former .
he was introduced to galileo galilei through academic and ecclesiastical contacts . galileo exerted a strong influence on cavalieri encouraging him to work on his new method and suggesting fruitful ideas , and cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to galileo . galileo said of cavalieri , `` few , if any , since archimedes , have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry . `` he also benefited from the patronage of cesare marsili.cavalieri 's first book was lo specchio ustorio , overo , trattato delle settioni coniche , or the burning mirror , or a treatise on conic sections . in this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into parabolas , hyperbolas , and ellipses , and various combinations of these mirrors . the work was purely theoretical since the needed mirrors could not be constructed with the technologies of the time , a limitation well understood by cavalieri.inspired by earlier work by galileo , cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the method of indivisibles to calculus and published a treatise on the topic , geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota ( geometry , developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua , 1635 ) . in this work , an area is considered as constituted by an indefinite number of parallel segments and a volume as constituted by an indefinite number of parallel planar areas . such elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of cavalieri 's method . as an application , he computed the areas under the curves

helen singer kaplan ( february 6 , 1929 – august 17 , 1995 ) was an austrian-american sex therapist and the founder of the first clinic in the united states for sexual disorders established at a medical school . the new york times described kaplan as someone who was `` considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists . she was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods . `` she was also dubbed the `` sex queen `` because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the sexual revolution in 1960s america , and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy sexual activity as much as possible , as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful . the main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most prevalent , worrying and distressing medical complaints of modern times .


== life ==
kaplan was born in vienna , austria , on february 6 , 1929 . in 1940 , she emigrated to the united states , becoming a citizen in 1947 . she received a bachelor of fine arts from syracuse university in 1951 , graduating magna cum laude . she was then educated at columbia university , where she received a master 's degree in psychology in 1952 , and then a phd in psychology in 1955 . at new york medical college , she earned a medical degree in 1959 , and later completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis there in 1970 . in 1964 , she initiated a unique residency program for women mds with children at new york medical college , the `` mother 's program `` enabled residents to be free during vacations and emergencies to care for their children . she was a long-time professor of psychiatry at weill cornell medical college and the payne whitney psychiatric clinic .


== sex research and therapy ==
a psychologist and psychiatrist by training , kaplan viewed human sexual response as a triphasic phenomenon , consisting of separate—but interlocking—phases : desire , arousal , and orgasm . she concluded that `` desire `` phase disorders are the most difficult to treat , being associated with deep-seated psychological difficulties.kaplan wrote extensively on the treatment of sexual dysfunctions , integrating other methods with principles of psychotherapy . as did many other experts in her field , kaplan believed that sexual difficulties typically had superficial origins . she suggested that premature ejaculation occurred if the subject did not have voluntary control over when he ejaculated , and that coitally anorgasmic women should not necessarily be thought of as having a problem.kaplan always encouraged people to enjoy having sex as much as possible . however , since the epidemic of aids into the united states from 1981 into the 1990s , she has had to add the caveat : `` if you are n't extremely careful , it can kill you . `` kaplan commented that she `` absolutely hate [ s ] having to say that . [ ... ] i have spent my whole life devising solutions to people 's problems , telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful , but a natural function . and now i have to tell them , 'hey , look out . you could die . ' '' two of her disciples are ruth westheimer and hans-werner gessmann , a german psychologist and psychotherapist , he introduced 1976 in the psychotherapeutic institute bergerhausen her sexual therapy approaches in conjunction with the humanistic psychodrama and hypnosis in germany .


== personal life ==
kaplan was married twice . in 1953 , she married sex therapist harold kaplan . they had three children , phillip kaplan , peter kaplan , and jennifer kaplan-d'addio , before divorcing in 1968 .

paštko-obanov ( russian : аторо ивашонович оаностанко , ukrainian : аторо ивашонович оаностанко ; 12 november 1863 – 8 march 1943 ) was a russian russian physicist , mathematician , and engineer . his name is best known for an important work that he formulated in the early 1930s , but this work is often linked with the development of the wave theory of electrodynamics ( at the time it was considered its own discipline , and by the late 1930s it had become one of the most important physics disciplines ) . the work became a major early example of field theory in quantum mechanics .
his work on noncommuting non-lattice equations led him to develop methods of algebraic analysis . his many projects at the institute of theoretical physics in leningrad , and his book code-free algebra ( 1959 ) , are credited with popularizing these methods .
during world war ii , he headed the leningrad physics department and headed the leningrad nuclear institute ( a unit of the leningrad academy of sciences ) .

he died in santa monica , california on april 14 , 1947 ) . he is buried in forest lawn memorial park in glendale .


== career ==
tracy sonneborn would later write : jennings was so struck by the continued production of hereditarily diverse clones at conjugation , even after many successive inbreedings , that he undertook to examine the matter mathematically . as a result , general formulae for the results of diverse systems of mating were published in a series of papers between 1912 and 1917 ; these were one of the main seeds from which the whole field of mathematical genetics developed .
in 1924 , jennings published an article in scientific monthly on `` heredity and environment `` which was prescient for anticipating the double helix , and provocatively liberal for its comments on racial differences and american immigration policy.jennings was the recipient of the inaugural 1925 leidy award of the academy of natural sciences of philadelphia.after complaints about the documentary titled the hereditarily diseased , the carnegie institution of washington appointed jennings to review the work of harry h. laughlin at the institution 's eugenics record office , then part of what has become the cold spring harbor laboratory . jennings found falsified data and manipulated conclusions , and laughlin was forced out . in 1930 , he published the biological basis of human nature , discussing eugenics , genetic influence on human traits , and criticizing simplistic interpretations of heritability based on mendelism , emphasizing gene-environment interaction & polygenicity ; sonneborn would describe the impact of the biological basis of human nature as widespread : `` probably no book by a geneticist has been so widely quoted by american workers in the fields of education , sociology , anthropology , and psychology . in spite of inevitable misquotation and misinterpretation , it has exercised a distinctly salutary effect on those fields and is to a large extent responsible for whatever they have assimilated in this country from modern genetics . ``

= christian grubb =
christoph august christian grubb ( 10 march 1535 in stettin – 6 march 1635 in münster ) was a theologian of the reform of the german reformation .


== life ==
he was born in the village of stettin , the son of thomas grubb ( d. 1582 ) and his wife caroline ( née gläffer ) , and entered the episcopate at the age of six , whereupon he entered the house of the astronomer constantius felix , to whom he frequently addressed himself . on the death of constantius felix , in 1582 , he became tutor of his son , and was called to the chair of doctrine , afterwards ; but , in 1587 , after having been elected vicar of berne , he was ejected by the reformers , and detained in stettin , so as to be deprived of his clerical powers , and deprived of his offices as rector of the said college .
he was employed in designing and constructing the former palace of the gymnasium , and in other ecclesiastical matters , and was afterwards one of the predecessors of elias münster , afterwards bishop of göttingen , and bishop of dresden , dresden in 1607 . in 1607 , he came to stettin , where his native birthplace , and house , and the famous church , were greatly loved , and are to-day still noted . the old german university , between which the humboldtian and ionic exchange stands , was reconverted to protestantism , and his choice of residence , he says , to that place , and of a great age , was a generous kindness of attention to piety . the teaching of the reformed school , in which he was the head , was eloquent , dignified , and , though ( he says ) somewhat oftener than is usual in a german theologian , in a good measure modish ; nor did he abuse the liberties of the professors , who ( at that time ) visited him and heard the more of his discourse . his study of eastern science ( which must have been more extensive than that of his ancestors ) , which , notwithstanding being principally germanic , he sometimes showed in an oriental manner , added an admirably to the comfort and improvement of his companions , and was of consequence to all his successors.he made considerable private collections of greek and latin antiquities , and brought letters to the german statesmen and other prominent men of letters , amongst them archibald cumont and jakob prüfer , and some pamphlets on the history of politics , especiallie in historia humano et cartographye . he had letters from the pope and princes to him , and also private letters from john calvin and thomas foster ( afterwards bishop of durham ) . grubb was a patron of luther 's work , and also for the learned jan koßler ( 1609–1664 ) .


== works ==
he is most esteemed for the revue sur l'évolution de la juge , libre et artificiel , opus locum ex pentate dilutione , which appeared in 1605 , and was afterwards edited by thomas bennett . it contains four volumes ; in which is the full list of characters , of every science , of every church , and of every district in germany .

his letters are on the ruins of a gothic church of the exchange at stettin , in germany .

( for one complex variable this type of functional transformation was introduced by émile borel . ) martineau was one of the early advocates of the theory of sato 's hyperfunctions and gave lectures on this topic in seminar bourbaki during 1960–1961 . according to pierre cartier , martineau played a role in the development of the concept of schemes in algebraic geometry by means of a remark made to jean-pierre serre.consider a quotation from the year 2004 :

a set in complex euclidean space is called c-convex if all its intersections with complex lines are contractible , and it is said to be linearly convex if its complement is a union of complex hyperplanes . these notions are intermediate between ordinary geometric convexity and pseudoconvexity . their importance was first manifested in the pioneering work of andré martineau from about forty years ago . since then a large number of new results have been obtained by many different mathematicians .
martineau was an invited speaker at the international congress of mathematicians in 1962 in stockholm with talk croissance d´une fonction entiers de type exponentiel et supports des fonctionelles analytiques and in 1970 in nice with talk fonctionelles analytiques . his doctoral students include henri skoda .

decleau was a founding member of the french academy of sciences , chairman of the anthroposophic society , and one of the founders of the société musculaire , both in 1894 and 1895.his contributions in herniation are noted in numerous studies , e.g. , the volume blasphemy exposé d'absences par la paralyze et du sacroiliac les hénatiques in 1906 .
a 1993 posthumous book on decleau , la caprice octopelagic , became a classic of herniation literature and remained a favorite of this reviewer .

= peter stoner =
peter stoner ( june 16 , 1888 – march 21 , 1980 ) was chairman of the departments of mathematics and astronomy at pasadena city college until 1953 ; chairman of the science division , westmont college , 1953–57 ; professor emeritus of science , westmont college ; professor emeritus of mathematics and astronomy , pasadena city college .
stoner is probably best known for his book science speaks that discusses , among other things , bible prophecies vis a vis probability estimates and calculations . the work is often cited in the field of christian apologetics in regard to bible prophecy . professor stoner 's book became widely known when it was mentioned by josh mcdowell in his 1972 book evidence that demands a verdict ( revised as new evidence that demands a verdict ) .


== american scientific affiliation ==
peter stoner was a co-founder of the american scientific affiliation , a christian organization that describes itself as `` a fellowship of men and women in science and disciplines that relate to science who share a common fidelity to the word of god and a commitment to integrity in the practice of science . `` the foreword to stoner 's science speaks includes a partial endorsement from this body ( covering the book 's scientific content and prophecy probability calculations , but not addressing issues of biblical exegesis or historical accuracy ) : they considered it `` ... in general , to be dependable and accurate in regard to the scientific material presented `` and the probability material presented in regard to prophecy . while the asa includes members with a diverse range of attitudes towards science ( theistic evolutionists , intelligent design advocates , old-earth creationists and young-earth creationists ) , stoner himself was apparently an old-earth creationist .


== criticism ==
c. p. swanson , reviewing science speaks in the quarterly review of biology , wrote : `` ... the author has fallen into the commonest error of using only these facts which bolster his hypothesis , and of discarding or controverting those which do not . for example , his discussion of the theory of evolution is not only misleading ; it displays an abysmal ignorance of recent evolutionary studies . `` various critics have taken issue with stoner 's interpretation of prophecy . stoner 's apologetic work did not receive critical attention until its inclusion in josh mcdowell 's evidence that demands a verdict and criticism of these claims tends to be addressed to mcdowell rather than stoner , with stoner 's name mentioned in passing . these criticisms against mcdowell , stoner and others include historical errors , claims regarding after-the-event authorship and/or tampering with biblical prophecies , and disputed meanings of certain biblical phrases .
others who disagree with specific claims made by stoner include fellow christians and secular historians : for instance , while stoner says of ezekiel 's prophecy of the permanent destruction of tyre `` if ezekiel had looked at tyre in his day and had made these seven predictions in human wisdom , these estimates mean that there would have been only one chance in 75,000,000 of their all coming true . they all came true in the minutest detail `` , others claim that `` the problem is that very little of this actually came to pass ! in fact , it badly missed how history actually unfolded `` and `` the location of the city of tyre is not in doubt , for it exists to this day on the same spot and is known as sur . `` however , it could still be argued that the boundaries of the ancient mainland city may have fallen within areas of the modern city not rebuilt in the present day .

alexander bonfield ( january 13 , 1842 – october 25 , 1942 ) was an american naturalist and anthropologist .


== early life ==
bonfield was born in new hampshire on january 13 , 1842 . he attended the eastern new england academy . he spent two years at yale university where he graduated in 1857 .


== career ==
bonfield was an expert on the american fauna , although he never published on the subject . he became professor of anthropology and zoology at boston university and later harvard university , where he produced one of the best written accounts of american and european animal life in english . his three-volume , monumental work , the history of the mammalia of the united states , was a landmark in the history of natural history.his aim was to take the wealth of scientific knowledge of the united states into a scholarly context , filling in the gaps in this knowledge in order to make a comprehensible , detailed , and informative picture of our animal neighbors . at the same time , he maintained a strong personal , social and philosophical relationship with his students , a relationship exemplified by his own and their devotion to one another . this style of development marked him as an extraordinary educational teacher who influenced the generations of american naturalists who came after him . as a scholar he was often criticized for being less concerned with history than with illustration . he was never particularly interested in other fields , and he was largely self-taught in all but one field : zoology . his best works described in a systematic manner the features of a wide range of american animals . among his most important discoveries was the field of ornithology .
he began working on what became the mammalia of the united states after the completion of his `` the history of the mammalia `` in 1856 . the vast majority of his work focused on , and was based upon , his knowledge of the american fauna and fisheries . his subsequent publications included the field notes to the collections of north american mammals ( 1860 ) , the mammal genus : america ( 1868 ) and the descriptive volumes on `` living fossils `` ( 1875 ) and `` the distribution and affinities of the birds `` ( 1884 ) .
as an educator , bonfield made a point of stressing the roles of both parents and children in their upbringing . he was the first person to teach his own children how to interpret and interpret in the way they wanted to see a particular object . one of the first children he taught the social psychology of learning to is sam and his mother pat taub . sam is the primary example of a boy who grew up in isolation and left home early because he feared abandonment from his father , a position he himself had.in contrast to the boy sam , the many girls in his life left home early to pursue their interests . in his review of ann , another of his great works , he wrote :

who is the author of ann ? and how does this child come to know him as a father who educated him , and who nurtured him , and who taught him to look upon his accomplishments as significant and noble , and valued as he himself regarded them ? it is about him that women finally gather to discuss the more recent field of `` sexual difference `` . he is the first to have awakened the warning voice of the father who sent the child away .

in 1932 , merle randall authored two scientific papers with mikkel frandsen : “ the standard electrode potential of iron and the activity coefficient of ferrous chloride , ” and “ determination of the free energy of ferrous hydroxide from measurements of electromotive force . ”


== education ==
randall completed his ph.d. at the massachusetts institute of technology in 1912 with a dissertation on “ studies in free energy ” .


== related ==
based on work by j. willard gibbs , it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an equilibrium determined by the free energy of the substances taking part . using this theory , gilbert lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances . in 1923 , he and randall published the results of this study and formalizing chemical thermodynamics .
according to the belgian thermodynamicist ilya prigogine , their influential 1923 textbook led to the replacement of the term “ affinity ” by the term “ free energy ” in much of the english-speaking world .

= thomas sergeant hall =
thomas sergeant hall ( 23 december 1858 – 21 december 1915 ) was an australian geologist and biologist , recipient of the murchison fund in 1901 .


== early life ==
hall was born in geelong , the son of thomas march hall , a business man in that town but originally from lincolnshire , england and elizabeth , née walshe , from dublin . hall was educated at the geelong grammar school where he came under the influence of james l. cuthbertson . he was a junior master at wesley college in 1879-80 , then hawthorn college and then went to the university of melbourne , where he took his b.a . degree in 1886 with honours in natural science . this included work in palaeontology under sir frederick mccoy . hall taught for a year at girton college , sandhurst ( now bendigo ) in 1887 , but returned to the university and did a three years ' course in biology under professor sir baldwin spencer .


== career ==
hall took a leading part in the forming of the university science club , and through it met dr g. b. pritchard with whom he was later to do valuable work in geology . hall was a successful director of the castlemaine school of mines from 1890 to 1893 , and in the latter year became lecturer in biology at melbourne university . hall held this position until his death but found time for many other activities .
in 1899 hall published a catalogue of the scientific and technical periodical literature in the libraries of victoria . a second and enlarged edition , in which he was assisted by mr e. r. pitt of the public library , melbourne , appeared in 1911 . he did much valuable work for the field naturalists club of victoria ( president 1901–1903 ) , the royal society of victoria , and the australian and new zealand association for the advancement of science . his victorian hill and dale ( 1909 ) , describing the geology of the country around melbourne , is a model book of popular science , written without a trace of scientific jargon ; there is barely a technical term in its 150 pages . he did not write a large number of papers , but his work on the graptolite rocks of victoria led to his being made the recipient of the murchison fund of the geological society of london in 1901 . one of his major discoveries was the key to the unravelling of the complex ordovician sequence .


== legacy ==
hall became ill early in 1915 , but courageously carried on his work until shortly before his death from chronic nephritis on 21 december 1915 . he married miss eva lucie annie hill on 21 december 1891 , who survived him along with three sons and a daughter . he was given the honorary degree of d.sc . by melbourne university in 1908 .
dr hall was a good example of the hard-working man of science , giving much time to matters of routine , and yet contriving to do original and important work in one or more directions . hall 's work with dr pritchard on the tertiary fossiliferous strata of victoria , and his own work on the graptolite rocks of victoria gives him a permanent place in the history of australian geology .

thomas michael donahue ( 23 may 1921 , healdton , oklahoma – 16 october 2004 , ann arbor , michigan ) was an american physicist , astronomer , and space and planetary scientist .
donahue graduated in 1942 from rockhurst college in kansas city and received in 1947 his phd in physics from johns hopkins university , with an interruption of his graduate studies by ww ii and service in the army signal corps .

after three years as a post-doctoral research associate and assistant professor at hopkins , tom joined the university of pittsburgh physics department in 1951 . at pittsburgh he organized an atomic physics and atmospheric science program that led to experimental and theoretical studies of the upper atmosphere of the earth and other solar system planets with instruments flown on sounding rockets and spacecraft . he became professor of physics in 1959 and eventually director of the laboratory for atmospheric and space sciences and the space research coordination center at the university . in 1960 he spent a sabbatical year on a guggenheim fellowship at the service d'aeronomie in paris , which began collaborations with french colleagues that flourished for more than 40 years . in 1974 he became the chairman of the atmospheric and oceanic science department , university of michigan , a position he held until 1981 .
according to the fall 2004 newsletter of the university of michigan 's department of atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences , donahue said :

i want to know how the planets of the solar system were formed , how they came to evolve as they did and the significance of all that for the existence of life in the solar system and in rest of the universe .
he was chairman of the committee on public policy of the american geophysical union and authored more than 200 research publications . tom 's influence in space exploration spanned many decades and diverse projects . he was an experimenter or interdisciplinary scientist on the orbiting geophysical observatory missions , apollo-17 , apollo-soyuz , voyager , pioneer venus multiprobe and orbiter , galileo , comet rendezvous asteroid flyby , and cassini . based on observations by the pioneer venus entry probe , he concluded that venus once had an ocean before a runaway greenhouse effect led to its current state . analyzing similar data from martian meteorites , he again argued for a substantial martian ocean , anticipating the current series of missions to mars . in these and many other cases he laid the foundation for our current understanding of planetary atmospheres .
in 1999 , tom described his career this way , `` i parlayed my training in atomic physics into a faculty position at pitt , doing research in aeronomy and laboratory studies of atomic physics . this led to rocket and satellite exploration of the upper atmosphere of earth in the 60s and spacecraft exploration of mars , venus and the outer planets beginning in the 70s . along the way my students , post-docs and i were deeply involved in the problem of anthropogenic destruction of the stratospheric ozone in the early 70s . this led to my continuing interest in global change . ``

upon his death , he was survived by his wife , three sons , and six grandchildren .

= hugo von seeliger =
hugo von seeliger ( 23 september 1849 – 2 december 1924 ) , also known as hugo hans ritter von seeliger , was a german astronomer , often considered the most important astronomer of his day .
he was born in biala , completed high school in teschen in 1867 , and studied at the universities of heidelberg and leipzig . he earned a doctorate in astronomy in 1872 from the latter , studying under carl christian bruhns . he was on the staff of the university of bonn observatory until 1877 , as an assistant to friedrich wilhelm argelander . in 1874 , he directed the german expedition to the auckland islands to observe the transit of venus . in 1881 , he became the director of the gotha observatory , and in 1882 became a professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the university of munich , which post he held until his death . his students included hans kienle , ernst anding , julius bauschinger , paul ten bruggencate , gustav herglotz , richard schorr , and especially karl schwarzschild , who earned a doctorate under him in 1898 , and acknowledged seeliger 's influence in speeches throughout his career .
seeliger was elected an associate of the royal astronomical society in 1892 , and president of the astronomische gesellschaft from 1897 to 1921 . he received numerous honours and medals , including knighthood ( ritter ) , between 1896 and 1917 .
his contributions to astronomy include an explanation of the anomalous motion of the perihelion of mercury ( later one of the main tests of general relativity ) , a theory of nova coming from the collision of a star with a cloud of gas , and his confirmation of james clerk maxwell 's theories of the composition of the rings of saturn by studying variations in their albedo . he is also the discoverer of an apparent paradox in newton 's gravitational law , known as seeliger 's paradox . however his main interest was in the stellar statistics of the bonner durchmusterung and bonn section of the astronomische gesellschaft star catalogues , and in the conclusions these led about the structure of the universe . seeliger 's views on the dimensions of our galaxy were consistent with jacobus kapteyn 's later studies .
he continued his work until his death , on 2 december 1924 , aged 75 .
the asteroid 892 seeligeria and the lunar crater seeliger were named in his honour . the brightening of saturn 's rings at opposition is known as the seeliger effect , to acknowledge his pioneering research in this field . minor planet 251 sophia is named after his wife , sophia .

he studied at the faculty of philosophy of university of olomouc , and in 1772 began his theological studies at the premonstratensian convent of bruck , near znaim . having been ordained in 1775 , he for a short time held a cure at misslitz , but was soon recalled to bruck as professor of oriental languages and biblical hermeneutics .
on the suppression of the convent by joseph ii in 1784 , jahn took up similar work in olomouc , and in 1789 he was transferred to vienna as professor of oriental languages , biblical archaeology and dogmatics . in 1792 he published his einleitung ins alte testament ( 2 vols . ) , which soon brought him into trouble ; the cardinal-archbishop of vienna laid a complaint against him for having departed from the traditional teaching of the church , e.g . by asserting job , jonah , tobit and judith to be didactic poems , and the cases of demoniacal possession in the new testament to be cases of dangerous disease . an ecclesiastical commission reported that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical , but that jahn had erred in showing too little consideration for the views of german catholic theologians in coming into conflict with his bishop , and in raising difficult problems by which the unlearned might be led astray . he was accordingly advised to modify his expressions in future .
although he appears honestly to have accepted this judgment , the hostility of his opponents did not cease until at last ( 1806 ) he was compelled to accept a canonry at st stephens , vienna , which involved the resignation of his chair . this step had been preceded by the condemnation of his introductio in libros sacros veteris foederis in compendium redacta , published in 1804 , and also of his archaeologia biblica in compendium redacta ( 1805 ) . the only work of importance , outside the region of mere philology , afterwards published by him , was the enchiridion hermeneuticae ( 1812 ) .

= philip slughorn =
philip slughorn ( 15 may 1907 – 29 march 1980 ) was an english protestant theologian , professor of theology at vassar , and advocate of a reformed roman catholicism in the united states . he authored the catholic tradition and the modern world , and both god in history and a critical history of the church .


== biography ==
slughorn was born on 15 may 1907 in gloucester , england , the son of philip slughorn ( 1879–1938 ) and marianelle ( née jeffries ) slughorn . in 1938 , he married elisabeth julia richards , daughter of e. scott richards , dean of king 's college , london , who died in 1950 . she died two years later on 29 march of that year , and was succeeded by his second wife , clare acworth richards , of mount allison , maine . he married his third wife in 1948 , while still at king 's .


== views ==
slughorn advocated an `` anglican tradition in the british catholic tradition `` , of which the second half was preceded by a revised version , the second parish . he saw no need for the traditional church to continue to adhere to biblical revelation . his first published work was a critical history of the church , in 1959 . he contributed to many books and journals , and was a regular contributor to the american catholic . while at king 's , he was editor of the american studies review .


== approaches to catholicism ==
slughorn believed that he `` understood the reasons for american catholicism , and the catholic theological reason , to be in the interdependent system of history of the church `` . modernist protestantism was a `` central aspect of catholicism `` . religion was always a matter of `` individual choice `` , but there were good and bad reasons for joining and not joining various major denominations . an essential difference between traditional catholicism and modern protestantism was the justification of catholic doctrine through reason .
he rejected the theological method which was used by many contemporary protestants , but believed that in catholicism the `` process of systematic investigation and systematic critique of dogma is ... essential , and the process which yields a satisfactory judgment of dogma must always remain an act of conscious faith. `` slughorn believed that `` faith alone , as such , can sanction itself as a reliable basis for dogmatic controversy `` , and found in his early catholic writings a `` higher level of mystery `` than orthodox protestantism.slughorn rejected the teaching of the jesuits and the teachings of the council of trent . he instead supported the historic authority of the holy see . he was an opponent of ecumenism , arguing that all anglicans need to engage in dialogue with one another . slughorn advocated that the current supreme pontiff of the roman catholic church , pope john xxiii , be replaced `` on the present day or the appointed day , by a pope as said to be more just `` .
slughorn identified with the traditional form of the roman catholic church , with its insistence on the natural order of creation and that jesus christ was god . he called that form `` anglicanism `` , but later said it `` hides the biblical truth. ``


== criticisms ==
the following is a list of some of slughorn 's works , in chronological order :

god in history

= august von kosciuszko =
august albert kosciuszko ( 31 july 1903 , münster – 5 january 1997 , madrid ) was a german physicist .
born in münster , he studied in kiel and became a professor at the albert university of munich in 1938 . he then served in the armed forces for two years . his formal doctorate in physics was awarded in 1951 under the supervision of the physicists hermann heisenberg and richard feynman .


== scientific activities ==
while working in kiel , august and his colleague , otto hahn , predicted the gamma ray and neutron bombardments . august kosciuszko carried out this research in 1957 . the satellites of the european space research organisation sputnik were observed by observing the fainter evidence of an extensive nuclear fusion process , subsequently discovered to be active . this event , which was attributed to heavy water explosions in the sun 's outer atmosphere , was later observed to be due to what was termed a `` thermonuclear fission `` or `` thermonuclear fission of plutonium-238 to uranium-235. `` he revealed that radioactive fission of plutonium-238 is occurring with an atomic weight of 240 gev . this event occurred about 40 years before the discovery of atomic bombs and was referred to as a `` bang `` or `` nuclear explosion `` and had an amazing impact on both science and politics .
he became interested in particle physics after the discovery of the bose–einstein condensates by wilhelm wigner . while conducting his research in munich , he demonstrated in 1952 that , by exchanging a positively charged atomic nucleus for a negatively charged atomic nucleus , a number of forces exist between them . these forces are termed `` the monotony principle `` and are the same ones which explain why objects ( including protons and neutrons ) behave the same on an atomic scale . the first experiment conducted using the theory of conduction of protons , which resulted in the observation of neutrons decaying rapidly into neutrons , was referred to as the first `` bang `` . he published his findings in a 1959 paper in the journal nature and shared this important discovery with ferdinand von neumann.kosciuszko is considered one of the greatest physicist of the 20th century.he is a member of the german academy of science , and the albertina wilhelm leopoldina . he also presented his research in the scientific papers of karl popper.kosciuszko was named a chevalier of the order of merit of the german empire in 1958 .

he was the second child of john stephenson and elizabeth harrison . he was the nephew of general james douglas ( 1694-1782 ) and his wife mary george ( née grace ) . gandhi was educated privately by his father and brothers , andrew , henry and charles.he fought with the ordnance survey under general sir george marshall for the support of the war of 1812 . in the years following the repeal of the corn laws he served as major-general of the imperial forces and returned to india as a non-commissioned officer . he founded the national frontier commission in 1819 , and the mandate for south india ( or commonwealth of india ) in 1822 . in the valley of the two rivers he was awarded the medal of honour by king george v. gandhi , acting in the cause of independence from britain , was also the founder of the indian national congress , a political party ( national congress ) which became the fourth largest party in india.he was elected as a member of parliament for the district of durham in 1822 , serving from 1824 to 1831 . he served as prime minister of india for 25 years ( from 1845 to 1874 ) . as leader of the british indian national congress , he stood down from his seat as prime minister of india in protest against the policies of the indian national congress . he was succeeded by lord palmerston , who received the croonian award from the government of the united kingdom .
gandhi supported the `` benevolent seigneurialism `` of lord mountbatten , which made it easier for poor people to access equal opportunities in politics . he endorsed the idea of building a canal through burma , and by contrast the legacy of the 1870 british invasion of india , after india was separated from the british empire , led to the erosion of his legacy . he was also an advocate of provincial autonomy . he was an advocate of equal funding for schools .

a cast of civil servants from the indian government led by lord mountbatten , gandhi 's predecessor , led a wave of anti-colonial activism in india from 1960 to 1962 . this movement successfully brought about reforms that have made india a leader in many disciplines and inventions .

in the reprints of verne , he has placed the breviary of his father , bishop johann philipp schüler , in 1680-1711 . on this kramers ’ original catalogue of eider moth remains very uncertain , as apparently all the parts can not be represented at full length with precision . the genera sklogger ( family leucospiza ) and lepioptria ( family sphingidae ) are named in his honour .

= willoughby verner =
colonel william willoughby cole verner ( 22 october 1852 – 25 january 1922 ) was a british soldier , writer and ornithologist and inventor of a type of compass . he was briefly a professor of topography at the royal military academy sandhurst . he is remembered for bringing cueva de la pileta , a cave filled with prehistoric paintings , to international attention .


== life ==
verner was born in 1852 and he showed an early interest in bones owning the fossils of extinct animals . by 1867 he had started his own diary recording his interest in egg collecting and shooting . in 1874 he joined the rifle brigade and was posted to gibraltar although he also holidayed on the scottish island of tiree with fellow naturalist howard irby where they continued their interest in studying , shooting ( and eating ) the local wildlife . he continued his diary until 1890 .

he took out patents to improve a cavalry sketch board which was designed to be used strapped to the wrist . in 1895 verner had a novel version of a compass named after him . the compass was manufactured by two different companies and version nine of the design was still being made in 1942 .

verner became the official historian of the rifle brigade and he edited the letters home of one of its majors to produce a british rifle man : the journals and correspondence of major george simmons , rifle brigade , during the peninsular war & campaign of waterloo .
he also wrote the military life of h. r. h. george : duke of cambridge based on prince george , duke of cambridge .
he wrote sketches in the soudan ( sic ) in 1885 and rapid field-sketching and reconnaissance and advanced guard and outpost duties for riflemen in 1889 . the first british rifle corps . he wrote an historical account of the rifle brigade and of the king 's royal rifle corps in 1890 and some notes on military topography in 1891 and map reading and the elements of field sketching in 1893 . in 1894 his friend ( leonard ) howard irby published the ornithology of the strait of gibraltar and after he retired to algeciras he wrote my life among the wild birds in spain . with illustrations in 1909.in 1911 , verner discovered cueva de la pileta in benaoján and with abbe breuil also discovered devil 's tower cave in gibraltar . breil had come to spain because of verner 's reporting of cueva de la pileta near ronda . verner had been told of the cave that had been discovered by a spanish farmer called josé bullón in 1905 who was looking for bat guano . bullón had found human remains and markings on the walls , but assumed that they were made by the moors . verner had himself lowered into the cave and later reported his findings in the london-based saturday review . verner wrote a number of weekly reports for the review which factually described the cave , although verner accounted for the drawings of extinct animals by assuming that they had been sketched a result of observing the fossil bones that were there . it was these reports that brought breuil to spain with hugo obermaier , paul wernert and the spaniard juan cabre aquilo . breuil stayed in spain for two months studying the cave paintings whilst funded by the prince of monaco . verner later co-authored a scientific paper with breuil and obermaier on cueva de la pileta .
verner wrote history and campaigns of the rifle brigade in 1912 . in 1917 breuil returned and he and verner were warned off their next investigation of devil 's tower cave in gibraltar by a local policeman ( but not before they had retrieved some neanderthal tools ) . their final visit to the cave was in 1919 and they were convinced that this was another home to early man like the earlier finds at cuerva de la pieta and at forbes ' quarry cave , gibraltar 1 had been found over fifty years earlier . their confidence was confirmed when gibraltar 2 was found nearby in the early 1920s by dorothy garrod who had come to investigate at breuil 's encouragement .

philibert orry , count of vignory and lord of la chapelle-godefroy ( born in troyes on 22 january 1689 – died at la chapelle-godefroy on 9 november 1747 ) , was a french statesman .


== life ==
the fifth child of jean orry , a leading economist , philibert orry served as a cavalry captain during the war of spanish succession , before becoming a member of the parlement of paris , then master of requests in 1715 . he was an intendant in lille ( 1715-1718 ) , soissons ( 1722-1727 ) , and roussillon ( 1727-1728 ) .
orry was named controller-general of finances in 1730 and combined this function with being director general of the bâtiments du roi ( `` the king 's buildings `` ) in 1736 , after the death of the duc d'antin . orry remained controller-general until 1745 , making him the longest continuously-serving holder of the office in the eighteenth-century .
an able economist , orry had to restore the dixième ( `` tenth `` ) tax and declared the venality of municipal officials , successfully balancing the budget in 1739-40 . applying the principles of colbert , he sought to develop the domestic manufacture of textiles and paper , and was involved in the production of porcelain in vincennes in 1740 . he supported trade with canada and the indies by reforming the statutes of the compagnie des indes .
as director general of buildings , he established the bi-annual public paris salon , and became the vice-protecteur of the académie royale de peinture et de sculpture ( `` royal academy of painting and sculpture `` ) in april 1737 . his directorship has , generally , been harshly judged . the marquis d'argenson spoke with contempt of `` the bad , bourgeois taste of monsieur orry `` . however , orry 's selection of charles-joseph natoire in 1730 to decorate his château de la chapelle-godefroy ( see below ) reveals , on the contrary , a certain discernement in artistic matters : natoire was one of the most promising young history painters , and his two main rivals - françois boucher and carle van loo - were both abroad .
as director general of ponts et chaussées ( bridges and highways ) , orry finished the crozat canal and maintained and developed france 's road system . he sent to the intendants , in 1738 , a detailed instruction on the duty ( la corvée royale ) for all inhabitants to spend a fortnight a year on the construction and maintenance of transport routes , classed in five categories . the corvée made france 's major road network the finest in europe , and before the revolution , a great part of the public roads existed thanks to this institution . this policy of improved communications also led to the completion of the cassini map in 1744.facing opposition from madame de pompadour , orry resigned in 1745 .
he was the treasurer of the order of the holy spirit from february 1743 to his death in 1747 .


== residences ==
orry owned the château de la chapelle-godefroy in saint-aubin near nogent-sur-seine , inherited from his father in 1719 . `` m. orry `` , wrote the duc de luynes in his mémoires , `` has always appeared to have no ambition , always regretting not being able to live on his estate , near nogent , and always ready to go there with pleasure . `` he transformed and expanded considerably the seigneurial estate . he owned two paintings by jean-antoine watteau , the enchanteur and the 'aventurière , which today are in the musée des beaux-arts in troyes .
orry also possessed an estate , petit bercy , in paris .

roger fenton ( 1565–1615 ) was an english clergyman , one of the translators of the authorised king james version .


== life ==
he was born in lancashire and was educated at pembroke hall , cambridge , where he matriculated as a sizar in 1585 . he graduated b.a . in 1589 , becoming a fellow in 1590 . he graduated m.a . in 1592 ; he later proceeded b.d . in 1602 and d.d . in 1613 . from 1598 he was preacher to the readers at gray 's inn , and held the post till his death.in 1601 he was made rector of st. stephen 's , walbrook , and in 1603 of the neighbouring st. benet 's sherehog . he resigned the latter in 1606 , on his appointment to the vicarage of chigwell , essex . in 1609 he succeeded lancelot andrewes in the prebend of st. pancras in st. paul 's , which made him rector and patron , as well as vicar , of chigwell . fenton was one of the second westminster company of translators of the king james bible , dealing with the epistles of the new testament . he died 16 january 1615 , and was buried under the communion-table .


== works ==
fenton 's first work , an answer to william alablaster his motives , was published in 1599 , noting that william alabaster was then a prisoner in the tower of london .
in 1611 fenton published a treatise of usurie , in three books ; there was a second edition in 1612 . in 1652 there appeared a tract by robert filmer the author states in his preface that george downame , fenton and andrewes are the noted opponents of usury , in england , but ( he continues ) ' i have made choice of dr. fenton 's treatise to examine because it is latest , and i find little of any moment but is in him . ' a note by roger twysden in filmer 's book suggests it was written three decades before publication .
a manuscript in the cambridge university library ( ms ff . 5 . 25 , fos . 17r–22r ) contains a contemporary copy of a brief treatise by fenton , entitled 'de æquivocatione ' ( on equivocation ) . it is dedicated to sir francis bacon in his capacity as solicitor-general , and must therefore date from between 1607 and 1613 . like the english treatise of usurie this latin document consists of the resolution of three disputed questions on the subject of the work .
fenton was a popular preacher of the day ; one of his sermons , 'of simonie and sacriledge , ' was published in 1604 , from which it appears that he was at that date chaplain to sir thomas egerton , the lord chancellor . another was published in 1615 , 'upon oathes , ' preached before the grocers ' company ; and a small volume containing four more appeared in 1616 .
in 1617 , fenton 's successor at chigwell , emmanuel utie , published a posthumous work by fenton entitled a treatise against the necessary dependence upon that one head and the present reconciliation to the church of rome . together with certaine sermons preached in publike assemblies . utie prefixes a dedication of his own to sir francis bacon , in which he calls the treatise 'the posthumus [ image ] of doctor fenton ' , but says that it lacked final revision . in his dedication he alludes to fenton 's earlier dedication of his treatise on usury to bacon 's predecessor as lord keeper , sir thomas egerton . the sermons in this volume are six in number , with three of them having been preached before king james .

= gopala bhatta goswami =
gopala bhatta goswami ( 1503–1578 ) is one of the foremost disciples of the vaishnava saint , chaitanya mahaprabhu , and a leading historical figure in the gaudiya vaishnava school of hinduism . he was part of a group of vaishnava devotees known collectively as the six goswamis of vrindavan , who were influential in establishing the philosophical basis of the gaudiya tradition in formalised writings .


== background ==
born in a sri vaishnava family of tamil iyengar origin in sri rangam , and the son of venkatta bhatta , gopala bhatta goswami was a great devotee of laxmi-narayana . according to biographies such as the bhakti ratnakara gopal bhatta 's first meeting with shri chaitanya mahaprabhu was in 1510 during mahaprabhu 's tour of south india . although of a young age he was given the opportunity to meet with chaitanya and serve him over a number of months . such was his love for the saint , that when chaitanya mahaprabhu was about to leave , gopala bhatta became upset , and for gopala bhatta 's sake , chaitanya then agreed to stay a few more days .
according to gaudiya tradition it was during this time that gopala bhatta had a spiritual vision in which chaitanya mahaprabhu revealed himself as an avatar of krishna , the supreme god . in the vision krishna then told him that in the town of vrindavan he would meet with two devotees , namely rupa goswami and sanatana goswami who would instruct him in the finer details of devotional service ( bhakti ) .
when gopala bhatta awoke from the experience , he wanted to leave for vrindavan at once , however chaitanya mahaprabhu told him to stay and serve his parents . after chaitanya 's departure , gopal bhatta took guidance from his uncle prabhodananda sarasvati . gopal bhatta took care of his parents into their old age , and then after they died he then traveled to vrindavana . there he met rupa and sanatana who accepted him as a brother . gopal bhatta later helped sanatana compile the book hari bhakti vilasa .


== vrindavan ==

gopala bhatta studied rhetoric , poetry , vedanta , and sanskrit grammar from his uncle prabodhananda sarasvati . after the passing of his parents he went to vrindavan , where he met both rupa and sanatana goswamis as had purportedly been instructed in his vision .
when lord chaitanya discovered that gopala bhatta was in vrindavan , he was extremely pleased and sent some of his personal belongings to gopala bhatta , who worshiped them . mahaprabhu also sent a letter instructing gopala bhatta to help rupa and sanatana compile vaishnava literature . gopala bhatta accepted this instruction as his life and soul , and he later also engaged his disciple srinivasa acarya in carrying the writings to bengal . gopala bhatta established the radha raman temple in vrindavan in 1542 , his samadhi also exists within the temple complex .

taurinus described his logarithmic-spherical geometry as the `` third system `` besides euclidean geometry and spherical geometry , and pointed out that infinitely many systems exist depending on an arbitrary constant . while he noticed that no contradictions can be found in his logarithmic-spherical geometry , he remained convinced of the special role of euclidean geometry . according to paul stäckel and friedrich engel , as well as zacharias , taurinus must be given credit as a founder of non-euclidean trigonometry ( together with gauss ) , but his contributions can not be considered as being on the same level as those of the main founders of non-euclidean geometry , nikolai lobachevsky and jános bolyai .
taurinus corresponded with gauss about his ideas in 1824 . in his reply , gauss mentioned some of his own ideas on the subject , and encouraged taurinus to further investigate this topic , but he also told taurinus not to publicly cite gauss . when taurinus sent his works to gauss , the latter did n't respond – according to stäckel that was probably due to the fact that taurinus mentioned gauss in the prefaces of his books . in addition , taurinus sent some copies of his `` geometriae prima elementa `` to friends and authorities ( stäckel reported a positive reply by georg ohm ) . dissatisfied with the lack of recognition , taurinus burnt the remaining copies of that book – the only copy found by stäckel and engel was in the library of the university of bonn . in 2015 , another copy of the `` geometriae prima elementa `` was digitized and made freely available online by the university of regensburg .

agnew was born in brooklyn , new york , the son of james and catharine agnew . he attended the victor lincoln high school of woodbridge , vermont . he received his b.s . degree in medicine from harvard in 1895 and his m.d . from johns hopkins in 1902 .


== scientific career ==
he became a major member of the government 's chemical laboratory in baltimore , maryland , and a leading purveyor of penicillin , as early as 1897 . in 1900 he received a federal appointment as assistant under secretary of the interior in charge of the bureau of standards , which gave him direct control over all federal research . this was particularly important in coordination with the government 's chemical research laboratory at argonne national laboratory , where agnew was the first to synthesize penicillin . in 1903 he was elected as a member of the national academy of sciences . he became a professor of medicine at harvard university in 1905 , and went on to lead a large pharmaceutical firm until his death .


== activism for antibiotic therapy ==
in 1894 , agnew and his colleague joseph a. rosamilia realized that penicillin was as good a prophylactic vaccine as could be developed . in an 1897 paper , they published that an antibiotic working as well as anti-bacterial would kill 120 times as many germs as a standard penicillin formulation . this was greatly aided by the discovery of diphtheria toxin , in which penicillin contained 5 parts of the toxin , while the standard penicillin contained around 2 parts . agnew called for penicillin producers to be better prepared to develop new antibiotics , both for their own use and to research which antibiotics would be effective in higher cases . because penicillin was not available to the us at the time , these calls led to agnew and his associates being able to quickly produce their purified penicillin . though the published paper was controversial , it became the first documented example of penicillin being given a popular prescription.when franklin d. roosevelt became president in 1933 , agnew joined with other major penicillin manufacturers in urging fdr to abolish the division of soils , a division that involved natural resources and imported chemicals . agnew was concerned that this would have a very negative effect on the viability of the industry , as minerals and certain foreign chemicals were considered vital to the production and use of penicillin . further , by removing pressure from the government , control of penicillin would have become more tightly controlled and would have left the industry with no option but to continue to provide inexpensive injections . agnew was a strong advocate of the national government league ( ngl ) , a movement led by the world anti-fascist league ( wwa ) , which opposed the nazi takeover of germany and argued that , if the nazis did manage to take over germany , it would make the new government effective at preserving the jewish people , and should leave the united states free and open to global cooperation . agnew and his ngl were appointed to a house committee in 1934 , but their influence was limited as anti-nazi forces dominated public opinion .


== death and legacy ==
agnew died at the age of 81 in 1937 .


== personal life ==
agnew was the son of james and catharine agnew , and he married mary maud ocher and had two daughters , margaret ( born 1904 ) and deborah ( born 1906 ) . agnew had three sons , frank agnew and william walter agnew , two brothers , herbert a. and james brian , and a sister , ann .


== legacy ==
agnew 's papers were donated to the national library of medicine in the united states library system at albany , new york .

= robert hayne =
robert hayne ( 17 may 1883 , in london – 16 january 1973 ) was a british archaeologist who led excavations of palaeolithic sites in yorkshire for over 20 years . he is credited with elucidating the relationship between these areas and the later neolithic . he is best known for his successful excavations of nearby wybarr stone in the yorkshire channel .
hayne was educated at trinity college , cambridge and then spent some time at calcutta normal school before beginning his career . in 1898 , he took part in the construction of the bailey school , and his practical teaching of geology helped forge a lasting friendship with the school 's headmaster , james ritchie .


== career ==
in 1906 , hayne joined the yorkshire institute of archaeology as a research assistant and was given a ten-month leave of absence to build the bailey school ( now the edward archer school ) . by 1913 , he and ritchie were both forced to resign from their posts over anti-social behaviour in the school .
hayne 's later excavations , however , were never wholly successful . in 1922–1923 , he led the excavations at shropshire , meath and shrewsbury where he continued to lead important excavations , which included several sites important to science . these included the first known ( at that time ) effigy of a homo erectus from the prehistoric period , the first known human presence on a homogenous village , and a village cart and altar found in northern shropshire . these discoveries allowed hayne to believe that the site had once been used by nomadic hunter-gatherers as a prosperous trading town . this work , and hayne 's attempts to rebut the prevailing theory of the stone age , led to him being appointed a palaeolithic archaeologist to the british museum in 1923 , and he wrote the monograph eruption of the shropshire site : the shropshire site , first appearing in 1937.in 1922–1925 , hayne led the excavation at redhill , kendal , near leeds , where he named a suite of neolithic rock types known as vesiculites ( that was the name by which they are usually known today ) , the first species of rock and stone whose name had been established in english by william wilson in 1905 . following the excavation of the city , he conducted further excavations at leicester and leicester 's bay , further sequences at wakefield , sunderland , shrewsbury , wigglesworth and bridgewater . he also led excavations at guernsey , which opened in 1930 .


== other interests ==
in the 1920s , hayne also wrote a series of popular and popular books and articles about archaeology and human history . he was a co-founder of the british folklore society and chaired its council for the next 27 years . he was a senior lecturer at cambridge and was its vice-president from 1937 until 1951 . he was also a co-founder and university organiser of the archeological society , and its president from 1959 until 1961 . he received a knighthood from the queen for his services to archaeology in the 1930s and the procurator general of the british museum , for services to archaeology during world war ii.hayne and ritchie formed a close and lasting friendship , lasting until his death , during which time he encouraged ritchie to publish his papers on the stone age , until ritchie wrote them . although hayne enjoyed the company of many archaeologists , he was not granted permission to associate with any one particular person .

daniel nehemiah jensen ( november 23 , 1863 – december 8 , 1938 ) was an american metallurgist and engineer . he was noted for his work in refining galvanic and epithermal materials . he is best known for the concept of what he called `` magnetic coating `` which is a structural process whereby metal is coated with a molecular composition or layers of tiny electrons . this technique has been used to improve an engineer 's ability to operate a machine or process and provide for high quality control.jensen was born on november 23 , 1863 in denver , colorado . his parents were zora n. jensen , a pioneer in bird breeding , and james ronald jensen , a pioneer in forest forestry . daniel jensen attended rocky mountain high school and attended the university of denver college . jensen completed a doctoral degree in chemistry and mechanical engineering from the university of chicago in 1876 .


== biography ==


=== education and career ===
jensen was a charter member of the yale football club , which became the professional football team of the university of colorado . in 1879 , jensen was appointed professor of metallurgy and metallurgy at the university of denver . jensen was a pioneer in the use of epithermal compounds to enhance steel corrosion resistance and also applied for patent 7,193,527 `` magnetic covering of steel `` . this was the first patent granted to the u.s. in 1901 .


=== discovery of magnetic coating ===
jensen was also active as a long-distance runner and was known for his intense running regimen . he embarked on a seven-week road trip from denver to san francisco in may , 1882 and covered 120 miles in seven days . jensen noticed that during his 60-mile trek he lost 10 pounds . jensen spent over six months recording his findings using several logbooks , nearly doubling the number of hours of exertion at his disposal , and being advised by the scientific community to study this discovery closely . his work is now known to be the very first scientific research to explore the phenomenon of microspikes on solids , cement and ice . with the authority of his patents , jensen and henry ramsay began the first research involving a microspike problem .


=== more exciting discoveries ===
his contemporaries noticed jensen 's creative talent . the boulder herald-journal wrote about `` the accidental discovery of a newly developed application of improved technique , 'magnetic coating , `` stating that :

what gives jensen special effect when applied to steel and other soft and brittle materials is his astuteness in using metallic and chemical barriers . these qualities and more are the result of a series of experiments on melted metals , cement and calcite. `` jensen added that his discoveries would now `` explain the deposition of microspikes in automobile brakes , bridges and automobiles `` .


== longevity ==
his preferred term to describe his innovative work is `` dazzling `` , and was used by james ramsay in a well-known quote : `` the clever old man says that god is everywhere , and i can only say that i believe him . `` jensen was employed by the university of colorado , one of the largest universities in the united states , for the duration of his career and was awarded 28 patents for his research and other contributions to industrial matters.jensen married augusta ellen stinchfield ( 1873–1949 ) in 1889 , and had two children , henry ( 1898–1973 ) , who would become a distinguished u.s. army colonel , and elizabeth ann ( 1903–1998 ) . he died in boulder on december 8 , 1938 , after a long illness .

sir theodore hall , frs ( 1829 – 2 april 1921 ) was a scottish physicist who made contributions in the field of statistical mechanics . he published 13 papers on physics in the journal of applied physiology , which he edited , and nine in the physical review .


== biography ==
hall was born in edinburgh to john hamilton hall , a surgeon , and his wife hester hall . he studied at king 's college london , gaining his doctorate in 1858 . in 1864 he joined royal college of surgeons of edinburgh , where he was head of the laboratory and junior lecturer in 1869–75 . from 1876 until his retirement in 1917 he was an associate professor at the university of edinburgh . in 1879 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh , and in 1887 a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh . hall served as president of the physical society from its inception in 1883–84 .


== theories ==
hall was influenced by isaac newton 's principia and james clerk maxwell 's influential work in statistical mechanics . he suggested that statistical mechanics had the advantage of being fast and accurate , while classical mechanics was of little interest for the purpose of establishing how a small world operated . hall saw that , although the quantity of particles was small , the amount of energy required to propel each particle was large , and the law of conservation of mass must be true , because as one particle traveled through a sphere , it lost energy from traveling backwards . this law must hold , in the case of a sphere , if all the particles in it exist in a single space , i.e. , if the velocity of each particle as it travels through a circle increases linearly with the square of the radius . thus , hall 's theorem can be expressed as

= lucien g c3 a9las =
lucien gélas ( 1 january 1873 or 12 january 1873 – 5 june 1944 ) was a luthier , classical guitarist , and teacher .
gélas was born in menton , alpes maritimes . he composed for solo guitar and as well as works for voice and guitar set to his own texts . gélas owned the complete historic works of sor as published by meissonnier ( paris 1820-36 ) and pacini ( 1830–36 ) . the works are now a part of the spencer collection at the royal academy of music in london .


== gélas guitar ( double-top guitar ) ==
gélas is well known for inventing and patenting a guitar design which uses a double top : it is often called a gélas guitar , or a double-top guitar ( or double-resonance-guitar ) and was common in the first half of the 20th century .
gélas was awarded a gold medal at the bordeaux exhibition in 1907 and a gold medal at the brussels exhibition in 1910 for his double-top instruments.the two tops of the instruments have a resonating space between them . the inner top is not parallel to the outer one , such that the guitar can be observed to have a particular tilt . also , the strings run through the bridge ( which is on the inner top ) and are attached at the bottom , in such a way that the plucked part of the string before the bridge is at an angle to the part of the string after the bridge . this is achieved by having the plucked part of the string slightly angled to the inner top ( in conventional guitar it would be parallel ) , resulting in a raised tension in the inner top .
the patent was first filed in paris in 1905 ; and the patent text is downloadable in french and english.his guitars were played by numerous important artists , particularly in the first half of the 20th century . heinrich albert ( 1870–1950 ) obtained a gélas guitar ( from gaudet in paris ) and ascribes his concert successes in a large part to the guitar , praising its carrying sound , ease of responsiveness , and tone-colour . other players of gélas guitars included luise walker ( 1910–1998 ) and bruno henze ( 1900–1978 ) .
gélas produced the instruments with the help of guitar-makers ( following his patent ) , at first théodore gaudet and later jean roviès , beuscher , richard jacob and others . the instruments included classical guitars , mandolins , jazz double-basses and hawaiian guitars .

as we have seen , eigenvalues of homotopy groups are local when the curvature of the equation is negative and the sum of its subgroups is positive . this is generally the case in fixed points . however , n-trees containing only edges are then of negligible degree of curvature because their non-n-separable part has large singularities , and therefore all other simplifications need to be performed as there are large numbers of partial derivatives of the derivatives . such elimination is known as paucity-shaping .
in everyday functional analysis , small subgroups of a structure have ordered representations , as illustrated in

= ernst hans homann =
ernst hans homann ( 20 september 1880 – 22 february 1961 ) was a german theoretical physicist , author , and physiologist . he is credited with coining the term energy and with establishing a scientific theory of waves , galvanic effect , absorption of light by water , and the particle and wave analyzer theory . homann invented the prism microscope , which was introduced by charles wheatstone in 1904 , in his book `` optics and photometry. `` in 1921 homann successfully demonstrated the existence of the pauli–ribbon effect , and he proved the existence of the lamb shift in the quantum field theory . he believed the mass of electron vibrations for small particles , the lorentz transform of these vibrations , and the lorentz transformation of solutions of hilbert space geometry were significantly smaller than the planck length of their wavelength .


== life ==
son of a teacher in halle , homann studied physics and mathematics at the technical university of munich , graduating in 1893 . in 1905 , at the age of 23 , he became a laboratory assistant to wolfgang pauli . in 1908 homann , along with his assistant ernest toussaint , showed that electron waves appear to have separate nuclei , which is as far from the prediction of special relativity as it was possible at that time to put forth . homann 's work contributed greatly to the field of electromagnetic theory and was cited by friedrich zinn in his theoretical derivation of the concept of `` systematic relativity `` . in 1921 he demonstrated the existence of the pauli–ribbon effect , a phenomenon that describes the phenomenon of induced resonances of phonons when they are distorted by an electric field . it is associated with the electric lens phenomena of optical transmission .
homann was a founding editor of the journal physikalische zeitschrift .
in 1913 homann was awarded a grant by the munich pharmacological society to establish the institute of physiology in munich . with the help of paul grün , he founded the technical university of munich-chemical institute of biophysics and pharmacology , now in its 25th year of existence .
after the outbreak of world war i , homann made contributions to physics through experimental work in magnetism . in 1919 he was elected to membership of the vertebrat in the german people 's party ( dvp ) , with the dvp becoming a separate electoral party in 1920 . in 1922 homann , along with friedrich schwarzschild , discovered the emission of x-rays with cesium . from 1924 homann was a member of the newly formed science and education commission for the first scientific congress of the federation of german scientists and engineers .
after the reorganization of germany in 1933 , homann became a member of the berlin academy of sciences and humanities ( bam ) . after world war ii , in 1948 , he moved to the niels bohr foundation for the study of the behaviour of nuclear fission . in 1957 , he was invited by richard feynman to the international astronomical union at göttingen for a five-day meeting on cosmic rays . in his years at the niels bohr foundation , homann developed his physics concepts , while studying with j. pauli and in collaboration with max born . later , he was an expert witness at the trial of eugen von braun and the resultant controversy over his work on atmospheric pressures .
after his death in 1961 , his wife , ethel homann ( 1897–1975 ) , is credited with developing one of the most popular gardening strategies of the 20th century in the first half of the 20th century , homann 's rose garden , an all-weeds garden that is presently one of the most popular gardens in the united states .


== personal life and family ==
on 20 september 1880 , his parents , hans and catherina von köring , married in the town of wittenberg . they had four children , three of whom died early : johanna rudolph
georg friedrich homann
wilhelmine paula salomon
ernst bernhard homann
karl-heinz homann .
ernst georg christian homann married in 1890 the widow of the physiologist adolf muller , in munich . after she died , ernst married her younger sister , julia , in 1897 . after ernst 's death , adolf married max sophie christiane-lahti in 1895 .

wien developed the wien filter ( also known as velocity selector ) in 1898 for the study of anode rays . it is a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that can be used as a velocity filter for charged particles , for example in electron microscopes and spectrometers . it is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed . the device is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields , such that particles with the correct speed will be unaffected while other particles will be deflected . it can be configured as a charged particle energy analyzer , monochromator , or mass spectrometer .
while studying streams of ionized gas , wien , in 1898 , identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom . wien , with this work , laid the foundation of mass spectrometry . j. j. thomson refined wien 's apparatus and conducted further experiments in 1913 then , after work by ernest rutherford in 1919 , wien 's particle was accepted and named the proton .
in 1911 , wien was awarded the nobel prize in physics `` for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat `` .

graduating in 1827 . he then established a legal practice
but after a period of emotional depression and an attempted suicide , he changed professions .
he studied natural science at the university of göttingen in göttingen , germany , but transferred to the university of berlin in 1835 to study plants . johann horkel , schleiden 's uncle , encouraged him to study plant embryology.he soon developed his love for botany into a full-time pursuit . schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope . as a professor of botany at the university of jena , he wrote contributions to our knowledge of phytogenesis ( 1838 ) , in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells . thus , schleiden and schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry . he also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus , discovered in 1831 by the scottish botanist robert brown , and sensed its connection with cell division .
he became professor of botany at the university of dorpat in 1863 . he concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from the one cell .

lee 's life tables became the basis of statistical methods and research from the 1920s to the 1950s . at the time , world war i was raging , and there was a need to research what a war based on war would mean for the populations in other parts of the world . however , lee considered such calculations in any force to be impractical , because populations in war zones also lived in different environments which would affect the health of their populations , and all data from places in the war zones was vital to future generations to help make any scientific predictions.lee and her husband , thomas emery lee , conceived of the subject based on her experience of being sick and in constant need of the emergency hospital . lee had to measure movement of vital organs throughout her body . these vital statistics she was able to obtain from patients were essential to the development of war rationing during world war i and later . the methods she devised became known as the emery and lee 's decision theory .


== awards and honours ==
lee was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1921 and became a foreign member of the american academy of arts and sciences ( 1921 ) , foreign member of the linnean society ( 1924 ) , and foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 1925 ) . in 1950 , she was appointed a companion of the order of the british empire .

== early years ==
yvonne olen was born in paris to a wealthy jewish family in 1887 . she was educated in france , germany , and switzerland and obtained a ph.d. from columbia university in 1932 . later in life , she had a conflict with her husband , who was a neurologist . he argued with her about her expertise and her romantic life . olen lost control of herself and began having epileptic seizures.olen 's parents did not have a particularly active jewish lifestyle . her father was an industrialist , but was a controversial figure ; both he and his wife suffered a succession of illnesses that put their children 's lives in danger . because of her father 's financial conflicts , his physicians were hired mainly to provide health insurance for his children.initially , olen was much better qualified than her husband . she had an outsize interest in learning , going so far as to write a textbook for her daughters in neurology . as a teenager , she gave an award at the marie curie festival at paris , during the world war i , to the daughter of general alfred von stockhausen . it was referred to as the `` honorary medal `` and was `` paid by the whole department of neurology `` .


== career ==
after leaving the university of paris in 1934 , she worked as an assistant to professor alfred huguenin in the university of bremen . by the time she was appointed as a full professor in 1949 , she had trained an additional 25 neurologists and had more than 300 students . at the university , she also published 10 books and several articles . olen joined the faculty of the university of bremen in 1953 . she remained there until she retired in 1980 .


== legacy ==
when her results were published in 1959 in the journal of the royal neurological institute in england , olen 's work was hailed as the first evidence for the existence of a temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome . however , even at this time , the prevailing notion was that ankylosing spondylitis ( a common form of neurology ) was the underlying cause of epileptic seizures . olen was one of the first scientists to refer the causes of the cause , which were made public after years of intensive editing . her work is still used to this day as a reference for researchers studying the etiology of temporal lobe epilepsy . in the last four decades , research has uncovered a wealth of scientific evidence that implicates prolonged periods of sleep deprivation in causing epileptic seizures.in 1976 , british neurologist and orthopedic surgeon and political activist james millar told of an encounter he had with olen on a saturday afternoon in 1954 : `` she was a great friend . she was even more brilliant at recovering from her epileptic episodes . i 'd be in jail if i knew how to deal with her . `` the american journal of medicine has listed olen among the leading 25 people to have been instrumental in the development of the testicular hypertrophy syndrome .

= ilya gergievich guldi =
ilya guldi ( june 17 , 1910 – september 19 , 1986 ) was a russian economist , mathematician , and professor of economics at the moscow state university ( msu ) . guldi 's major work was on special relativity and inflation .


== life and work ==
guldi graduated from moscow state university ( msu ) with a b.s . degree in 1930 . in 1932 he was offered a position at the msu by v.i . chernyshevsky and l.a. guldi . guldi defended a thesis on `` history of the dynamics of money and price `` in 1934 . in 1934 he joined the moscow economic institute and did research on banking and insurance . in 1938 , at the invitation of imperial russia , guldi returned to russia . he was the chairman of the committee of the government of the russian federation to prepare `` a strong economic and statistical organization `` . the committee met in 1943 and 4 years later formed the central committee of the ussr academy of sciences , which guldi served in until his death .
guldi , together with a.g. nabyshevsky and v.i . chernyshevsky , together with other experts from the moscow economic institute , developed statistical methods and methods of calculating the rates of interest and the interest component of the price .


== theories and demonstrations ==
during world war ii , guldi demonstrated the statistical method of computing the rate of interest in collaboration with v.i . chernyshevsky . a model of russian economy was developed for accounting purposes which relied on statistical methods .
in an analysis of the first period of the bank of russia gold reserves ( 1949–1956 ) , guldi made the following observations . according to the average of a number of economists , by the beginning of 1955 the gold reserves were 2,498,000 lire and the rate of interest was 5.22 percent . guldi concluded that :

in the first half of 1955 , at the present rate of interest , russia will hold approximately 70 percent of the world reserves.in february 1956 , during a visit to the moscow academy of economics , guldi developed the theory of storage of funds in the central bank of the ussr . for this purpose he was the first to measure the relative rigidity of the `` money reserve `` of the central bank , which is simply the fractional reserve of the reserves of the other bank .


== taxation ==
in one of the lectures , which was published by the central committee of the ussr academy of sciences in 1988 , he and a young economist mikhail gorney ( in 1928–29 when gorney was the author of the `` neo-marxism `` literature of the russian academy of sciences ) elaborated and demonstrated the information economy , which had become the leading force of social development in the ussr . the concept of money `` storage `` and the concept of goods-changers ( i.e . goods that result from taking a monetary value and keeping it as a unit of account ) were introduced by him . they were combined in a new system of prices for goods and services .
guldi distinguished four basic principles of practical theory :

price has its own value
prices have an inherent non-fractional basis
the free market maintains the system of prices in its institutions ( means of exchange , barter etc . )
the constant supply of prices leads to a stationary equilibrium of prices
prices are commonly calculable by an integrated flow-rate equation
prices follow the same sequence ( supply , demand , part and parcel )
the sale of a commodity does not change its value but only leads to its substitution in another commodity.in addition to this , guldi introduced the concept of the internet of things ( then still in the testing stage ) which was much important to many people during the period of the cyberworld .

nicolaas samuelszoon kruik ( latin : nicolaus samuelis cruquius ; 2 december 1678 , west-vlieland – 5 february 1754 , spaarndam ) , also known as klaas kruik and nicolaes krukius , was a dutch land surveyor , cartographer , astronomer and weatherman . he is remembered most today for the museum de cruquius bearing his name .
he was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in fahrenheit from 1706 to 1734 . his historical calculations are still used today by the knmi , the dutch meteorological institute . he not only measured weather changes in wind speed , rainfall , air pressure , temperature , and humidity , but also measured sea level . his method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth ( isobaths ) in his map of the merwede ( 1728 ) was the first of its kind . he was an advocate of pumping out the haarlemmermeer ( haarlem lake ) , which was done a century after his death .


== biography ==

he became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps , a lucrative job in his day . though born in vlieland , he moved to delft a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations . in 1717 at the age of 39 , though firmly established as a respected surveyor , he moved to the family farm in rijnsburg outside leiden and chose to study in leiden under herman boerhaave , at that time the most famous scientist in the netherlands . he signed himself in as `` krukius , medical student , born in delft `` . thanks to boerhaave , kruik became a member of the royal society of london . the secretary of the royal society at that time , james jurin , started the first european network of meteorological weather stations , and the dutch members played a large part . kruik was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1724.in 1721 and 1723 luigi ferdinando marsigli travelled to holland and he and boerhaave stimulated kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health . kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work . on these trips he was sometimes accompanied by boerhaave and marsigli . while studying the merwede , he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the netherlands dry .
it was at this time that kruik changed his name to the latin cruquius after his first publications of maps and measurements . in 1725 he wrote a famous letter to willem 's gravesande , a dutch professor of physics and astronomy at leiden , proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the netherlands . this letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the united provinces to create a water defence plan in 1727 . it was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of haarlemmermeer bij pumping the haarlem lake dry more than a century later .

in 1733 he became a member of the 'hoogheemraadschap rijnland ' , the dutch waterboard agency , and worked as a waterboard inspector in spaarndam . it was here that he met jan noppen ( 1706–1734 ) , the halfweg inspector , who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in zwanenburg with measurements 3 times daily of temperature , air pressure , humidity , and rainfall .
an eccentric man , kruik wrote music , and had an obsessive need to measure things . this need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily . according to contemporary accounts , only boerhaave could successfully work with him .

dehnius is remembered for proposing his quadrant law ( vindication ) to one of his superiors , johann abraham dirick . this proposal was based on the axiom of partial differential equations . dehnius , a prussian politician , was elected to the prussian parliament , and the law became part of german astronomy .
the law also explained the rotation and eccentricity of the earth , and as a later discovery disproved some of the famous comet theories of that time .
dehnius had originally developed his idea in a mathematics paper , but the new law found its way into more serious scientific discussion in 1803 . the proof of the law became a widely publicized phenomenon . many geocachers maintained high standards , and in the 1820s dehnius was given medals of honour by other states .


== life ==

otto wilhelm friedrich von dehnius was born in egersdorff , prussia ( now königsberg ) on 28 june 1745 , the second son of johann abraham dehnius ( 1705–1781 ) and his wife susanne . his father worked at an ophthalmological clinic , and died when otto was twelve.the family lived in dresden and vienna , where dehnius developed a keen interest in mathematics , natural philosophy and astronomy , and was elected to the vienna house of commons in 1766 . during his stay in vienna he met and befriended rudolf von kirchhoff , isaac newton , julius evola , and other prominent philosophers . his name was eventually used by william herschel to make his comets of 1814 and 1815 .
dehnius received his b.s . ( 1769 ) in mathematics from university of vienna and his m.d . ( 1774 ) from the university of leipzig , where he was an assistant physician . in 1782 he was elected to the house of commons in prussia , which replaced the lower chamber of the same name , which was largely controlled by prussian nobility . he then took up residence in leipzig . in leipzig he conducted astronomical studies under his mentor kirchhoff ( 1752–1829 ) , and in 1787 , published his first book , a work in progress in philosophy and astronomy , with an extra chapter on astronomy as applied to metallurgy . von dehnius soon became de facto inspector of the astronomy at leipzig , and the city 's annexation to the prussian republic , allowing him to take full and direct control of astronomy there , was the end of his political career . he retired from politics and returned to leipzig .
dehnius lived at leipzig for the rest of his life , and his duties at leipzig enabled him to learn what is known today as stellararithmetic , the study of eclipses and coronal transformations , beginning in the mid-1780s . during this time he also worked on the `` leipzig syndrome `` . this term is sometimes used to describe the night sky 's oblateness . he also did calculations using equations , such as the fourier series , which provided illumination in his book ästhetische begriff des natur in der physik .

dehnius published all of his works in leipzig , berlin , strasbourg , and bonn . he died in bonn , at the age of 69 , during the second voyage of the world 's first torpedo boat , the fritz plan , on 25 june 1805 . a crater on the moon is named after him .

kearfott had a peculiar approach to naming new species , using a very orderly , alphabetical fashion , resulting in specific names such as : bobana , cocana , dodana , etc . because kearfott 's names were published in widely distributed scientific journals and his species were adequately described and diagnosed , his names are valid . however , his naming practices were not deemed appropriate by other entomologists ; edward meyrick even responded to kearfott 's work with a paper called `` on some impossible scientific names in micro-lepidoptera `` , published in 1912 . in this paper meyrick described kearfott 's names as `` openly and obviously based on a barbarous and unmeaning gibberish . `` meyrick rejected kearfott 's names and proposed new `` appropriate `` latin names to replace them . because the names are valid however , this led to the creation of many synonyms.his collection of tortricidae is now in the american museum of natural history , while his collection of pyralidae went to the william barnes collection , which is now at the smithsonian .

== biography ==
prudence was born in liverpool in 1916 , the daughter of sir hugo rutherford . in 1936 she married john napier , a surgeon who was developing a particular interest in the hand . during the 1950s he became convinced that human functional anatomy could not be properly understood without a knowledge of non-human primates and , with prudence 's help , founded the unit of primatology in the royal free hospital school of medicine , which was the first centre in great britain devoted to the study of non-human primates .
prudence joined her husband in his work and increasingly set out on her own . she contributed to a handbook of living primates ( new york : academic press , 1967 , with john russell napier ) , the first book of its kind .
she was the foremost contributor to children 's books on non-human primates during the 1960s and 1970s .

louis arnauld de candagno ( french : [ ɑlāʁn bə . ] ; 30 may 1742 – 14 march 1809 ) was a belgian geographer .


== biography ==
louis arnauld de candagno was born in saint-françois-de-aube , in the duchy of deventer and graduated in 1777 . he was physician to the duke of buccleuch , the general of the hussite army , who was an opponent of the huguenots and the napoleonic wars . during the french revolution he was interned in a storehouse in benoît-sur-seine , but was permitted to return to brussels in 1789 .
he came to brussels in 1796 , in the employ of his father-in-law and charles-joseph giraud ( 1711–1786 ) . he was admitted as an assistant geographer in 1798 . in the same year , he travelled to russia as deputy state geographer in the ottoman empire .
in 1803 he was named geographer to the romanov government , which had assembled in kiev in 1801 .
candagno published a work of monumental and historical character ( histoire géographique des moscoms des cordeliers de jean-baptiste louis de candagno ) , which had eluded translation at that time , until francoise julien bretter 's edition was published in 1911 . his contributions to the geography of france ( 1794–1805 ) and britain ( 1805–1811 ) had opened up a new field in geographical research , the study of the global distribution of nations and their people . in this connection he was the first to find that the british isles stood on the `` southern end `` of the distribution range of the british isles .
the geographer jean-pierre loïc beaucaigne called him `` the father of geographers `` , and thus the first of them . on the other hand , french academic historians pierre-sébastien savard , drouet bursard , franck dufour , florian canton , and a small number of french officers considered him a great amateur who should be taken for a moron when elected to the geographical society of london .
candagno appears to have wished to go to switzerland to work for some partner or publisher of his large and important histoire géographique . in 1802 he took his post in palermo and at the time of his death in london in 1809 , by then in great financial difficulties , he was still holding the post as a professor of geography at the royal college of physicians in london .

= john tietjen =
john h. tietjen ( june 18 , 1928 – february 15 , 2004 ) was a lutheran clergyman , theologian , and national church leader in the united states . he is best known both for his role in the seminex controversy which roiled the lutheran church–missouri synod ( lcms ) in the mid-1970s , and for his efforts on behalf of lutheran unity that resulted in the formation of the evangelical lutheran church in america ( elca ) .


== life and work ==
tietjen was born in new york city as a son of german immigrants , and he attended stuyvesant high school , concordia collegiate institute ( now concordia college , bronxville ) , and concordia seminary in st. louis , missouri . he also earned master 's and doctorate degrees at union theological seminary in new york . after being ordained in the lcms in 1953 , tietjen rose through the synod ranks and eventually was chosen as president of its largest seminary , concordia seminary , in 1969 .
while president of concordia seminary , tietjen and many of the concordia faculty members faced opposition from a new , more conservative administration of the lcms . the faculty 's use of historical-critical method for biblical interpretation was cast by conservatives as being at odds with the historic theological position of the lcms . tietjen was accused of allowing the teaching of false doctrine , and he was suspended from his duties as seminary president in january 1974 .
as a result , tietjen and the majority of the seminary faculty formed a rival seminary which they dubbed concordia seminary in exile , or seminex . seminex existed in st. louis until august 1983 , and on the campus of the lutheran school of theology at chicago ( lstc ) until december 1987 . meanwhile , tietjen and many of his supporters left the lcms to form the more liberal association of evangelical lutheran churches ( aelc ) . during the early 1980s , tietjen and the aelc organized unity talks among several other lutheran church bodies , eventually leading to the formation of the evangelical lutheran church in america ( elca ) , which today is the largest lutheran church body in the united states .


== personal life ==
in 1953 , john tietjen married ernestine catherine dammitts ( 1925-2015 ) and had four children , catherine , laurence , mary , and sarah . he also has seven grandchildren jessica , jennifer , carrie , rachel , joseph , elizabeth , and chase . john tietjen battled lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , blood clots , and finally a brain tumor . he died in the comfort of his own home . during the last few months before his death he was working on a final book titled the gospel according to jesus . the original transcripts were typed , edited by his peers , and published by a private individual to create his new book .

= heinrich barkhausen =
heinrich georg barkhausen ( 2 december 1881 – 20 february 1956 ) , born in bremen , was a german physicist.growing in a patrician bremen family , he showed interest in natural sciences from an early age . he studied at the technical university of munich ( 1901 ) , tu berlin ( 1902 ) and university of munich ( 1903 ) and berlin before obtaining a doctorate at the university of göttingen in 1907.he became professor of electrical engineering at the technische hochschule dresden in 1911 at the age of 29 , thus obtaining the world 's first chair in this discipline .
in 1919 , he discovered the barkhausen effect ( named after him ) , which provided evidence for the magnetic domain theory of ferromagnetism . when the magnetic field through a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is changing , the magnetization of the material changes in a series of tiny discontinuous jumps , which can be heard as a series of clicks in a loudspeaker attached to a coil of wire around the iron . it was later determined that these jumps were caused by the movement of the magnetic domains in the iron , as the domain walls snap past defects in the crystal lattice . the energy lost in these dissipative events is responsible for the shape of the hysteresis curve of iron and other ferromagnets . this effect is widely used in research , and physics education as a simple experiment to demonstrate the reality of magnetic domains .
in 1920 , he invented the barkhausen-kurz oscillator , with k. kurz , the first vacuum tube electronic oscillator to use electron transit-time effects . it was the first vacuum tube oscillator that could operate at ultrahigh frequency , up to 300 mhz , and inspired later microwave transit-time tubes such as the klystron.in 1921 he derived the first mathematical conditions for oscillation in electrical circuits , now called the barkhausen stability criterion . they are widely used today in the design of electronic oscillators and general feedback amplifier circuits .
in 1933 barkhausen signed the loyalty oath of german professors to adolf hitler and the national socialist state .

= jacques creer =
jacques creer ( 24 november 1845 – 26 april 1912 ) was a french entomologist who specialised in insects , especially the mosquitoes .


== biography ==
jacques creer was born at carcassonne . he began his career as an assistant and later a chief gardener , and devoted himself mainly to the study of mosquitoes . as a result , in 1875 he wrote an article on subspecies of ant , liolaemus crescorum , of south africa . in 1886 he became a junior entomologist . in 1891 he published the results of an investigation , undertaken in conjunction with his colleague , dr. van schryver , and in the course of which the three of them collected in the hausend – sur-vincent region of southern africa an abundance of mosquitoes . the articles , collected during the years 1894–1895 , became a regular appendix in the entomologist , and were occasionally reproduced in local journals.upon his return to france in 1897 he started work on an introduction to zoology which appeared in four parts in 1902 , and another in 1905 . in 1905 he was the author of a lengthy article on liolaemus ( liolaemus crescorum ) , which appeared in the gazette de la société d'etude géographique , and in 1908 in the bulletin des minéralogie , ou , mémoire sur la société géologique des animaux , and in 1910 , together with other authors , the volume on liolaemus ( liolaemus crescorum ) which appeared in the journal des sciences naturelles , and also in the bulletin d'entomologie universelle .


== research ==

creer developed a theory of the inheritance of character which at one time was accepted by the majority of researchers in entomology . this idea was that a person becomes chaste ( mère chaleur ) when he or she is exposed to the intensity of the mosquito-borne disease , regardless of any hormonal or other factors affecting the body . however , in 1910 , creer and his colleagues presented , at the 60th international congress on parasites , the case of a hunter , surnamed creer ( norwegian : cresco ) , who was reported to have had a lifelong relationship with a parrot female , romée jean melchior , after her death from cholera . they ruled out that jealousy was at work and concluded that creer was simply being `` hard on `` her . this later became known as the creer case . however , the veracity of this case was questioned , and , in fact , the material that resulted from this investigation did not support creer 's hypothesis of the origin of character ; instead , it pointed to local personal relationships to be the factor in character formation.of note , creer also conducted an investigation which involved observations in a part of north africa , in partnership with eugène royer , and which led to the establishment of two families ( malipenes ) in asia and south america .
his most important scientific contribution was the development of a theory of the transmission of tsetse flies to other insects , which eventually led to the research of tropical diseases , particularly dengue fever.creer was an apothecary .
