Ludwig Borchardt ( October 5 , 1863 – August 12 , 1938 ) was a German Egyptologist who was born in Berlin . He is best known for finding a famous bust of Nefertiti at Amarna .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
 Also known as Herbert , Borchardt initially studied Architecture and later Egyptology under Adolf Erman . In 1895 he journeyed to Cairo and produced , with Gaston Maspero , the Catalogue of the Egyptian Museum ( Catalogue Général du Musée du Caire ) .His main focus was Ancient Egyptian architecture . He began excavations in Amarna , where he discovered the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose . Amongst its contents was the famous bust of Nefertiti , ( now in the Neues Museum in Berlin ) . From 1902 until 1908 , he undertook extensive excavations of the Pyramid of Sahure , exploring the entire mortuary complex . He published his discoveries in a two-volume study Das Grabdenkmal des Konigs Sahure , `` The Funerary Monument of the King Sahure '' , which is still considered the standard work on Sahure 's complex.Borchardt married Emilie ( Mimi ) Cohen , one of the daughters of Eduard Cohen and Ida Kuhn . In 1903 , Mimi received an inheritance from her grandfather Abraham Kuhn of 150,000 Marks , a considerable fortune equal to 53.7 kilograms of gold , and spent most of it on buying a villa in Cairo.In 1907 Borchardt founded the German Archaeological Institute ( Deutsches Archäologische Institut ) in Cairo , and remained its director until 1928 . While based in Cairo , he also directed the excavations in Heliopolis and the noble tombs of the Old Kingdom in Abu Gorab . He died in Zürich on August 12 , 1938 .   
 Recently , controversy has arisen with the assertion that Borchardt smuggled the bust of Nefertiti out of Egypt by reporting it as an artifact made of gypsum . However , the Swiss art historian Henri Stierlin has claimed that the bust is a copy dating from 1912 .

Valerio Agate ( 1891–1970 ) was an Italian entomologist.  
 Born in Milan, he received his university education at the Scuola per la Mosegiornata. After studying his second lyceum in Turin, Agate became a botanist and studied grasses of the southeastern and southern Italy. From 1929 to 1936 he was a research assistant at the Botanical Museum of Torino. After the death of Luigi Carlo Schleyer, who was a member of Agate's laboratory, Schleyer arranged for Agate to move to Florence, where he took on the role of plant pathologist. In 1936 Agate received his PhD ( dissertation in Italy ) in order to obtain an English teaching credential in pathology at the Agricultural School at Padua. He later taught at the University of Milan, and held the chair of entomology there from 1948.  
 The Agate Vertebrate System at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in Rome, with co-authors Alessandro Notta and Valerio Riccioli, is named after him.

 = Clifford Hendrick =  
Clifford Hendrick, CBE, FRS, FOSE, LLM, FCSE, FSN, FGS, FODB, FSA ( 12 November 1868 – 19 October 1943 ) was a Scottish geologist, entomologist, biologist and zoologist. He was the first curator of the Girton Museum at Harrow and later of the Geological Society of London.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Hendrick was born in Kirkby, in 1868, into a family of musicians. His father, Henry Lewis Hendrick, was a music teacher. He studied composition and music in Glasgow and at the Musica Mathematica College in Edinburgh where he studied under Charles Bain, with whom he was lifelong friends. In 1876 he became first in his class to obtain a first class in music. He then returned to Scotland to attend the Conservatorium of Music in Lisburn, where his father continued to instruct students. He then enrolled at the University of Glasgow, where he was influenced by the experimental and the thinking of Percy Bysshe Shelley and the St. John of the Cross School of Scots, which pioneered the teaching of classical music.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The biographer John Grey, who knew Hendrick and his family well, recollects : `` That Hendrick had a distinctive voice was recognised long before the word ever filtered out of his lips. His syllables [ were ] pitch sensitive, and his phrasing would suggest one pitch of the way to distinguish between the words of musical thought. Even at this early stage, he understood what Shelley, in his two earliest plays, meant by that word 'heart'''.Initially he was taught by Lewis MacFarlane. In 1911 Hendrick took a university course in classical singing ( at that time called horn singing ) under George Taylor and was an expert horn-singing student, until being offered an invitation to join the Girton Museum, the University of London's geological research unit. Although he was not a great amateur horn player, he acquired the skills needed for the task. He trained in the field under Dr. Charles Bain in the summers of 1906 and 1909. At Girton Hendrick was first to build a life-size model of Sir Thomas Herriot's geological epigraph for his son, the geologist James Herriot. The grave marker at Girton also reads `` L.H. Dreyfuss ''.  
   
 In 1912 Hendrick became the curator of the Geological Society of London. He was also active in the `` Corps for the Protection of Mammals and Birds '', the Public Advisory Council for the Forest Reserve, and was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London in 1910.Hendrick retired from the Geological Society in 1915, having made an `` earnest effort to give to science the basic measures of science as a distinct science ''. In 1917 Hendrick returned to Girton, where he continued to work in the museum until his retirement in 1920. He taught zoology to the boys at Girton. He served on the Geological Society's committee on Entomology in 1932-1935 and on the Geological Research Committee in 1937-1940. Hendrick lived for a time at Mount Head, a popular recreation.  
 Hendrick and his wife Clara moved to the English countryside in 1919 and lived at Irmin Nambour in Athlone, where he dedicated his life to the protection of public birds. In 1937 his work was recognised by the Wildlife Trust of Great Britain.He died at Girton, in his native Gartown, on 19 October 1943.

 = Oleksander Konstantinovich Preobrazhensky =  
Oleksandr Konstantinovich Preobrazhensky ( Russian : Николай Андре́й Андрович Новной, ; 20 October 1902 – 15 April 1987 ) was a Soviet geologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Preobrazhensky was born on 20 October 1902 in Besansky, Ukraine, into a family of prominent men in the banking industry. He attended Besansky Gymnasium ( Russian : Пергелогич Кунса ), where he was a student of Vladimir Sedevik. His father Eduard Preobrazhensky was the leading banker and an influential member of the Soviet elite. Another son, Oleg Preobrazhensky was also a leading figure in the banking industry, and, like his father, was a patriarch in the Besansky community. At Besansky, Oleksandr spent his early years getting a normal education. His second year he went to Besansky Polytechnic Institute to study philosophy. When Preobrazhensky graduated from Besansky, he chose to continue his education at an extremely elite departmental institution, the Department of Geology of the Department of Metallurgy. At that time, geology was a sub-specialty, which made it almost impossible to find an excellent candidate for that particular field. Moreover, there was a significant degree of skepticism among Western scientific societies. Even the relatively conservative American Geologist Robert Louis Stevenson had not accepted the accepted field of geology. Nonetheless, his experience and professional interests in the subject were quite well known within the U.S.A. As a result, Preobrazhensky was recommended to the director of the Metallurgy Department, Alexander N. Baker. In 1944, the Government of the Soviet Union gave Preobrazhensky the rank of Major General and promoted him to Major General. In 1945, he became a Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  
 Preobrazhensky left Besansky for Leningrad in 1949, just before the Soviet government was launched into full democracy. He arrived in Leningrad at the height of the summer Soviet working week, in the midst of the Great Patriotic War, and on a busy time-frame. Preobrazhensky had spent several months as a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister at the United Nations. During this period, he worked closely with the first Soviet Geologist of Geological Sciences, Alexander Landov. Through this foundation of knowledge, which lasted for a number of years, he produced several major contributions in the field of paleontology and stratigraphy. He was particularly known for his groundbreaking `` Geological Survey of the USSR '', which covered many areas of the Soviet geology. He was awarded a Presidential Commendation for his pioneering work. From 1950 until 1960 he was director of the Metallurgy Department of the State Geodetic Service. In 1959, the Geological Institute of the USSR awarded him the Royal Geographical Society's J.D. Benson Gold Medal, as it is considered to be the most prestigious academic award awarded by the U.S. Geological Survey.  
 From 1964 until his death in 1987, Preobrazhensky was the head of the Geological Survey of the USSR. He was one of the first representatives of geology in the United States. Between 1963 and 1972, he was the Director of the Geological Survey of the USSR. He was often seen lecturing in engineering and technology courses in the United States, and on various other occasions in Europe.He was also an important conservationist. The life-size figurine of Preobrazhensky was dedicated to the summer Labor Day commemorations. It was placed in the Plouform Museum of the Leningrad State University.

 Foster was born in New York City, the only child of Alfred Foster, a dealer of naturalist jewelry, and Hattie ( Ahn ) Foster. Arthur graduated from Columbia University in 1902, and earned a master's degree from Yale in 1903.Foster took classes in natural history and science at Cornell University and Harvard University. During the course of his doctoral research, he employed the phenomenon of palaeontological periods, using fossil parts of invertebrates. He visited many British and American museums and gardens ; and described numerous unique invertebrate fossil animals. Foster was president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, from which he was expelled after they found out about his love for ichthyosaurs.After graduate studies in geology, he studied minerals, showing that there was more mineral content in claystone than in ice, forming the basis for his textbook, `` Plate Tectonics of North America '' ( 1910 ), in which he developed the theory of glacial and interglacial erosion. He also attempted to demonstrate the early development of fossils of prehistoric times, in his book `` The First Precambrian Vertebrates of North America '' ( 1916 ), and the revision of other authors, including Bernard Harms of Yale, Henry C. Gilbert of the Smithsonian Institution, and L. C. Murray of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Foster also led the construction of a paleontology school at Washington State University and was awarded the Clark Medal in 1921.

 = Marie Hanstock-Bartholomew =  
Marie Hanstock-Bartholomew ( July 15, 1782 – December 20, 1873 ) was a Canadian naturalist, ornithologist and entomologist.  
 She was born in Jackson, Ontario, Canada, and was educated in London and the United States, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1797 from the University of Toronto, her doctoral dissertation being a contribution to the zoology of mosquitoes. She later taught at many colleges in Ontario and was active in the Department of Zoology and Forest Products at the University of Toronto ( 1814–1818 ), the Hunterian Club in York, and the National Museum of Natural History ( 1822–1835 ).  
 Hanstock-Bartholomew has been described as a follower of natural history philologist Charles Darwin. In 1816 she undertook what became one of her most important voyages. On April 30, 1816 she made a fifty-mile sail from London to the shore of the Hudson River, while sailing from New York to Toronto and thence to Saint John. She collected everything on board, from the shells to the feathers, feathers to the birds, eggs to the babies. Her goal was to study the evolution of birds and they have since become recognised as the universal building blocks of birds and the basis of all subsequent taxonomy.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Hanstock-Bartholomew was born to William Hanstock and Maria Louise Loveland of Northwestern Ontario in the 1830s. The Hanstocks had just emigrated from Europe when she arrived in Canada, and there were probably eight children, the eldest seven born in London, North Wales. Her mother was active as a female choir teacher in the provincial school system. The eldest daughter, Martha Armitage, accompanied her parents for four years to study as a minister in the city of Sudbury, from 1835 to 1841. She was married in 1846, and afterward was a nun in the local Franciscan monastery. Her marriage was registered in the Province of Manitoba and was dissolved in 1854. She and her wife moved in with Louis, who died in 1845. The couple was buried in a Jewish cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.  
 After marrying Louis'sister Elizabeth, Marie was employed as an assistant to Lady Mary Thomson. She was appointed Curate of Upper Newmarket Church and spent the rest of her life in Newmarket. She was a pacifist, and from 1857 to 1860 spent summers in Newfoundland with her family. She left Newmarket for Moncton in 1866, and was probably there in 1869 when she married Professor Albert Melfi of B.C. and travelled to Niagara Falls, New York. She spent time with the Melfis, he a pioneer pioneer of Arctic entomology. In 1869 she became a teacher of natural history at Moncton University, and then from 1871 to 1875 taught at the Hunterian Club in York. She also took the time from summer vacations to travel with her husband to Canada and the Americas, researching the habits and diversity of North American birds, particularly the eastern Mississauga Macaw.  
 As a young woman, Hanstock-Bartholomew was educated and travelled with her husband, taking classes on insects and birds. She married in 1845. They settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where she remained for the rest of her life. By the late 1880s, Louis was emigrating, so that she was able to be near him. In 1904 she died at age 88, leaving a legacy of knowledge and a lifetime of field work.

 = Henri Cohen (composer) =   
Henri Cohen ( Amsterdam , 21 April 1806 – Paris , 17 May 1880 ) was a French music theorist , composer , and numismatist of Dutch birth .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Born in Amsterdam , Cohen moved with his family to Paris at a young age . He studied in Paris with Anton Reicha ( music theory and composition ) , François Lays ( singing ) , and Felice Pellegrini ( singing ) .   
    
    
 == Music ==   
 In 1832-34 and 1838-1839 he was active as an opera composer in Naples , with some of his works premiering under the name Carlo Coen . In 1841 his opera Antonio Foscarini premiered successfully at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna , prompting a revival the following year at the Teatro Regio di Torino . He was thereafter active as music teacher in Paris , including teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris , and was for a time director of the conservatory in Lille .   
 Cohen wrote several compositions , one of which , the opera `` l'Impératrice '' , was performed , about 1834 , in Naples , Paris , and London . Moreover , he published four tracts about musical theory .   
    
    
 == Numismatics ==   
 He published several works during his lifetime . Cohen 's Guide de l'amateur des livres à vignettes du XVIII Siècle went through four editions and is considered the standard bibliography of French 18th century illustrated books . He is perhaps best known for his two fundamental works on ancient numismatics : the first , published in 1854 , dealt with the Roman Republican coinage , while the second , issued in 8 volumes from 1859 to 1868 , focused on the coinage of the Roman Empire , from Pompey to Romulus Augustus ( 49 BC - 476 ) . Cohen was also curator of the numismatics collection at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris .   
 Cohen died in Bry-sur-Marne .

 = Edward Jaffa =  
Edward Jaffa ( 18 October 1901 – 20 December 1964 ) was an Israeli physicist who made important contributions to what we know as quantum mechanics. In 1928, he made his discovery about the six-electron colorless quark, the quark nucleus. Jaffa's work was influential in early electron theory and is still relevant.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Jaffa was born into a Jewish family to Bethe and Roy. He was educated at a yeshiva, Hebrew University, and then studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of Leopold Kronecker, a German mathematician. In 1936, Jaffa was awarded a PhD in mathematics, at the age of 19, following a lecture by John von Neumann. Later that year, he married Doris Nessa Ramzan, a mathematics PhD student. The Ramzanes later moved to the United States.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1936, Jaffa moved to Montreal, Canada, where he studied at the University of Montreal under Professor Alexis van Rooyen. In 1938, at the age of 20, Jaffa was a member of a team led by Van Rooyen and Giuseppe Tosi in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This team was led by Leonard J. Kaptchuk, who taught at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In 1941, Van Rooyen and Jaffa joined the Max Planck Institute for Theoretical Physics in Hamburg, Germany, where the research focused on electron and proton collisions in metals. In 1944, with the help of Richard Feynman, John von Neumann, Fermi and Jaffa proposed a unified approach to what is now called high-energy physics. They set out to measure the energy at the sub-photon level in the earliest theoretical particles. This was done using a method called the Feynman–Jaffa-Poisson experiment ( FJP ), also called the Field Field Planck experiment. Their calculations predicted the theoretical lowest energies, that is, the lowest energy states of the smallest known elementary particles ( the letters F, W and Z ), using the external frame of reference for the Planck measurement.Their results were important in the field of high energy physics, as it was believed that they supported the atomic model of nuclear fission. At that time, they also proposed that C=N=0. In this, they were followed by other groups, including Max Planck, who formulated a fission model in 1961. Other groups with their efforts on this and other high-energy problems included the Bohr group, the Geiger–Loeffler group and the Liouville group. In 1945, at the age of 29, Jaffa, along with Eugene Wigner, Max Born, and Andrei Sakharov were inducted into the National Academy of Sciences. In the same year, Jaffa moved to, and helped to lead the preparation of, the Geiger-Loeffler-Radcliffe–Bell curve. This work is related to the prediction of the Feynman–Jaffa field in 1947. These early calculations are still cited in today's semiconductor technology, such as CMOS and laser junction technologies. Jaffa was president of the American Physical Society from 1942 to 1943.In 1948, Jaffa became the mathematics department chair at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was instrumental in developing the two-dimensional electronic instrument ( VEL, early electronic code computer ), known as the Virvan. In 1953, he was named head of the institute's Special Projects Division, which was the youngest department in the university's history.  
   
   
 == Later life and death ==  
 In 1966, at the age of 63, Jaffa died at Berkeley from cancer, which he had caught a few months earlier. He was survived by his daughter, Ruth, and his son, Jonathan Jaffa. He is buried in Cypress, California, along with his doctoral student, Arthur P. Batchelder.

Alexander Hollaender ( 9 December 1898 – 6 December 1986 ) was one of the world 's leading researchers in radiation biology and in genetic mutations . In 1983 he was given the Enrico Fermi Award by the United States Department of Energy for his contributions in founding the science of radiation biology , and for his leadership in promoting `` scientific exchanges '' between American scientists and scientists from developing countries.Hollaender was born in Samter , German Empire ( Szamotuły , Poland ) , he emigrated to the US in 1921 .   
 In 1939 Hollaender published research showing that the mutations of spores of the ringworm fungus occurred in the same spectrum as the absorption spectrum of nucleic acids indicating that nucleic acids form the building blocks of genes . A young Esther M. Zimmer , who worked with Dr. Hollaender at the U. S. Public Health Service ( Bethesda , MD ) , published with Dr. Hollaender and Milislav Demerec in this very early field of x-ray- and UV-induced mutations . Later on , Esther M. Zimmer ( now Esther Lederberg ) became one of the most influential founders of bacterial and bacteriophage ( Lambda ) genetics . Later on , Hollaender worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratories with M. Laurance Morse , who himself later went on to collaborate with Esther Lederberg .   
 His research was not appreciated for its discovery at the time , and later scientists reports were necessary before science accepted the role of nucleic acids as the genetic material . Historians of science now realize his early discovery , and his Fermi Award recognized this discovery.In 1981 Hollaender established the Council for Research Planning in Biological Sciences , and was its president at the time of his death from a pulmonary embolism in 1986 . The US National Academy of Sciences gives the Alexander Hollaender Award in Biophysics every three years in his honor .

 = Gustav Hertz (minister) =  
Gustav Friedrich Hertz ( April 5, 1851, Berlin - September 8, 1917, Hamburg ) was a German doctor and theologian.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 His father, Gustav Hermann Hertz ( 1836–1908 ), was a professor at the University of Königsberg. Gustav studied theology in Bonn, and obtained his doctorate in 1879.  
 He worked as a priest in the German Episcopal Church in Hamburg. While there, he influenced the young Wilhelm Hauptmann, who in 1885 founded the Baptist weekly Gesellschaftliche Zeitung in Hamburg. In 1886, he became associate pastor at the Synodal Church of the Resurrection, Hamburg. In 1895, he was named professor of Dogmatic Theology at the University of Hamburg.He was a prolific writer, including textbooks on medieval thought, and most of his theological works have since been translated into more than 40 languages.  
 The Gerhard Hofmann Freiburg congregational building is named after him.  
 The Hans Christian Storr St. Petersburg University named the Christian Church of St. Peter and St. Paul on 16 November 2009 as the church of Gustav Hertz.  
   
   
 == Writings ==  
 In Die Religion ( Kantner Verlag, 1888 ), Hertz drew a comparison between the Pelagian doctrines of Thomism and mysticism, arguing that although they were inspired by faith, their `` dogmatic grounds '' had `` deeper intellectual underpinnings '', such as the being of God in Christ.In Die Religion ( Wien, 1894 ), the philosophic focus of the work was on Thomism and ethics.  
 In Die Religion ( Leipzig, 1898 ),, Hertz attempted to suggest a teleology. He argued that theology as a discipline can begin from `` as deistic an internal sense of individuality and its generative theme '' as `` the reflection and propagation of an indivisible ontological or philosophic state ''.In Die Religion ( Wien, 1900 ), he defended an ontological argument for prescience. According to this claim, when we know a thing, the knowledge gives us knowledge of God, the positing of which originates in prior knowledge.

James Six FRS ( 1731 – 25 August 1793 ) was a British scientist born in Canterbury . He is noted for his invention , in 1780 , of Six 's thermometer , commonly known as the maximum- minimum thermometer . This device is still in common use today and widely sold in garden centres .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Six was from a family of refugees from the Continent who had settled in England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , and who had worked as silk weavers for generations . James Six himself had trained in the family business , but by his time this was in decline because of cheap imported silks from India and Persia .   
 He became interested in natural philosophy , and devoted himself to astronomy and meteorology . In 1782 The Royal Society of London published an account of the thermometer that Six had invented two years earlier . He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1792 , his election was the result of this and other papers he had published on meteorology .   
 In 1783 he performed a number of thermometrical measurements on Canterbury cathedral in conjunction with Sir John Cullum , who wrote about them for Philosophical Transactions in “ Account of extraordinary Frost , 23 June 1783 ” , ( Philosophical Transactions , lxxiv ( 1784 ) ) .   
 Six wrote about his invention in his book , The Construction and Use of a Thermometer for Showing the Extremes of Temperature in the Atmosphere , during the Observer 's Absence , together with Experiments and Variations of Local Heat ; and other Meteorological Observations . This was published posthumously in London , in 1794 , a year after he died .   
 James Six died on 25 August 1793 at the age of sixty-two . His wife Mary died on 19 March 1801 and they are buried together in a vault in Westgate Church , Canterbury .

Sir Frederick Walker Mott ( 23 October 1853 in Brighton , Sussex – 8 June 1926 in Birmingham , Warwickshire ) was one of the pioneers of biochemistry in Britain . He is noted for his work in neuropathology and endocrine glands in relation to mental disorder , and consequently as psychiatrist and social scientist . He was Croonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians for the year 1900.The Maudsley Hospital in London was Mott 's idea , inspired by Emil Kraepelin 's clinic in Germany , and Mott conducted the negotiations for its funding and construction . He ran the pathology laboratory which was transferred there , and treated shell shock patients during World War I . His reputation had been greatly enhanced by helping establish that 'general paralysis of the insane ' was actually due to syphilis , but he has been criticised for overly organic and degenerative assumptions in regard to mental illness including shell shock . After the war , in a lecture to the Eugenics Education Society , he claimed that shell shock was rare in volunteers as opposed to regular conscripted men , and that it was not a new disorder but merely a variation occurring in those already predisposed.Mott , like Maudsley , appears to have held that mental illness was inherited due to degenerate family lines that worsened until dying out , though his selecting of cases and statistics were questioned by other eugenicists . Mott advanced an overarching theory that mental disease was due to pathology of the sexual reproductive system , as evidenced for example by atrophied testes , causing breakdown of cerebral neurons in certain parts of the brain .

 = John George Wilder =  
Sir John George Wilder FRS ( 1885–1950 ) was a British bacteriologist, nutritionist and researcher in food culture.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wilder was born in Swindon in 1885. He studied at Balliol College, Cambridge, from 1918 to 1919, and was knighted by King George VI for his services to science. He began his academic career at the Department of Biological Sciences, University College London ( UCL ) in 1919 and, when his post was promoted to Physiology and Chemical Laboratory ( PCL ), continued to hold the post.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Wilder conducted a large number of investigations relating to various aspects of food culture, research equipment, life cycle and malic acid tolerance.  
 In 1925 he published his pioneering article `` An Introductory Examination of the Protein Structure of Wheat '' which had a profound influence on the field of food science. The article used stereochemistry to determine the amino acid sequence of the wheat proteins. He was the first to demonstrate that wheat proteins contained starch, which led to a renewed interest in starch and agriculture in the post war era.In 1936 he suggested that sugar be found in cattle milk. This work led to the establishment of a department of nutrition at UCL called the Microbiology Laboratory and Wilder was its chairman. He was also its senior research officer. His research at PCL and UCL contributed to the establishment of the research laboratory at Imperial College London in the 1930s.  
 During World War II, Wilder spent time in Singapore. In 1946 he developed the Wilder Index to help identify malformations in the flour and rice that could be attributed to possible inoculated cholera.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 At the outbreak of the Second World War, Wilder was awarded the Military Cross in the Bathurst ( 4 ) and Royal Victorian Cross ( 8 ) for his gallantry in action in the British forces. His combat record earned him the code : 214489.  
 In 1955 the Experimental Biology Society of Great Britain and Ireland ( EBS ) commissioned him to study bacteria at the Institute of Medical Microbiology, Imperial College London.In 1961 Wilder was made a Companion of the Order of the British Empire and received an honorary Doctorate of Science from University College London.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 The British soldier John George Wilder ( 1919–1991 ) met his future wife, Alice Wilder Gage, at one of her university lectures and they were married in 1924.

He then continued his studies and was awarded an M.S . ( 1951 ) and Ph.D. ( 1957 ) in sanitary engineering , biology and public health . Oswald joined the faculty of the university the same year and went on to become a full professor in 1970 . He remained in the position his entire career , staying on as an emeritus professor after his retirement .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Oswald studied the role of algae in wastewater treatment as a student , winning recognition from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his early work . He continued investigating the use of microalgae in sanitation throughout his career , developing strategies for combining engineered algae ponds to obtain specific water treatment goals . He developed the `` high rate pond system '' of shallow , mixed raceway ponds to maximize algae productivity . This design is still in use today , responsible for over 90 % of the world 's commercial microalgae production . His work led to the development of the `` Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond System '' , in which wastewater flows through a series of ponds , starting with deeper `` facultative '' ponds , then high rate ponds , and finally maturation ponds . The research undertaken by Oswald and his students and collaborators provided the foundations for much of modern microalgae wastewater treatment technology . Wastewater treatment plants based on his designs operate throughout the world today.With broader implications in energy and nutrient cycles , Oswald ’ s work often crossed over into related fields such as waste energy recovery , biofuels , animal feeds , and waste nutrient reuse . The Air Force ’ s interest in waste and nutrient recycling for long term space missions led to Oswald ’ s development of the Algatron–a device that would grow microalgae on astronaut waste , treating water and also producing oxygen and food.An archive of Oswald 's work is maintained by former student and long time collaborator Tryg Lundquist , now a professor of Environmental Engineering at Cal Poly , San Luis Obispo .   
    
    
 == Awards and honors ==   
 Oswald was recognized throughout his career . He received the Harrison Prescott Eddy Medal in 1953 from the Water Pollution Control Federation ( now known as the Water Environment Federation ) for describing photosynthetic oxygenation . The American Society of Civil Engineers awarded him both the Rudolf Hering Medal and the James Croes Medal in 1957 for work describing the fixation of nutrients and capture of solar energy by microalgae and the Arthur M. Wellington Award in 1966 for various investigations of life support systems for extended space travel . In 2005 he was awarded the lifetime achievement prize of the International Society for Applied Phycology and in 2006 he was nominated for the Stockholm Water Prize .

 = Ernst Julius Richard Ewald =   
Ernst Julius Richard Ewald ( 14 February 1855 – 22 July 1921 ) was a German physiologist born in Berlin . He was a younger brother to gastroenterologist Carl Anton Ewald ( 1845-1915 ) .   
 In 1880 , after finishing his studies in mathematics , physics and medicine , he became an assistant to physiologist Friedrich Goltz ( 1834-1902 ) at the University of Strasbourg . In 1900 he succeeded Goltz as chair of physiology at Strasbourg , a position he maintained until 1918 .   
 Ewald is best remembered for his research of the vestibular system of the inner ear , which largely involved experiments performed on the semicircular canal system of pigeons . From these studies the so-called `` Ewald laws '' are derived , which deal with the effects of endolymph motion on body , head and eye movements and also on the phenomena of excitation-inhibition asymmetries in the vestibular system .   
 Ewald 's first law : `` The axis of nystagmus parallels the anatomic axis of the semicircular canal that generated it '' .   
 Ewald 's second law : `` Ampullopetal endolymphatic flow produces a stronger response than ampullofugal flow in the horizontal canal '' .   
 Ewald 's third law : `` Ampullofugal flow produces a stronger response than ampullpetal flow in the vertical canals ( anterior and posterior semicircular canals ) .In 1892 he was given an award by the Paris Academy of Sciences for his monograph `` Physiologische Untersuchungen über das Endorgan des Nervus octavus '' .

 At the age of 25 in 1932 , Prebil began working at the Radium Institute in Paris under the tutelage of Marie Curie . Three years later , in 1935 , at the age of 28 , she would become the first woman in Great Britain to receive a PhD in nuclear physics . It is accepted that Leigh-Smith defended her thesis in London , however it is currently unknown from what university she was granted her degree.Dr . Alice Leigh-Smith was also involved in the use of radioactive substances as a treatment for cancer . From 1936 , she conducted cancer research as part of the British Empire cancer campaign . From 1938 to 1940 , during the Second World War , Alice Leigh-Smith was at the University of Bern in Switzerland , where she continued her work . In January 1943 , the anticipation of results from her study regarding the treatment of cancer with radioactive substances was published in the London Times . However , no results are available for current analysis .   
 In 1942 , Leigh-Smith and a Swiss chemist , Walter Minder jointly announced the discovery of element 85 ( now called astatine ) in 1942 . They proposed the name anglohelvetium for the new element , in order to honor both of their home countries- `` anglo '' for Leigh-Smith 's England and `` Helvetia '' after the personification of Minder 's country- Switzerland . This was Minder 's second attempt at discovering the element . It was later proven that Walter Minder and Alice Leigh-Smith had not discovered element 85 , after the failure of their results to be replicable .

 He was born in Mannheim. He became a Catholic in 1685 and had to leave the church because of `` his improper thoughts ''. In 1705 he was appointed to the chair of the anatomy of the mineral law of Saxony. He died in Würzburg.His work, his influence, and his attention have been developed to such a point that it is said that `` Engelmann's writing was the principal factor in the development of the science of natural history in Germany. ''  
 Engelmann is considered to be the first modern German botanist and the first botanist to thoroughly demonstrate that mosses can persist in any climate. Some present-day lichen species derived from Engelmann's microscopic work can still be seen on Mars.

Nathaniel Shepard Keith ( July 14 , 1838 – January 27 , 1925 ) was an American manufacturer , chemist , inventor , writer , and electrical engineer . Keith was born in Boston , Massachusetts and worked in his fathers laboratory . He was instrumental in designing , manufacturing , and installing the original electric lighting and power system in San Francisco , California . In 1884 he became editor of Electric World , co-founded the American Institute of Electrical Engineers ( AIEE ) and served as the first secretary of the organization . The AIEE merged with other societies in 1963 to become the IEEE , the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers .   
 Biography .   
 N. S. Keith grew up experimenting in his father 's laboratory in New York City . He was educated in the common schools of Dover , N. H. and New York City , and attended the New York University Medical School , but never practiced medicine . He also learned the basics of chemistry in the laboratory of his father , Bethuel Keith & Co. , a physician and chemist in drug manufacturer ( Bethuel Keith 1811-1884 ) . In 1860 , at age 22 , he followed the Pikes Peak Gold Rush to Colorado where he spent nearly a decade mining and milling in the Central City-Blackhawk area . He experimented with various processes to work the rebellious gold ores ( see `` Ore Roasting Furnace '' Patent No . 36437 , Sept 9 , 1862 ) . Although the `` Keith Process '' of ore crushing and smelting worked in the laboratory , he failed to perfect the system on an industrial scale . He was superintendent of several mining operations , including the well known Mammoth mine , which closed when the vein pinched out .   
 Returning to the East by 1870 , he became a respected New York City chemist and began experimenting with electricity . He operated nickel plating works in Newark and patented a method to remove tin from scrap , patented in 1876 . He also patented early electric lights and motors , among the earliest patents . He was active in professional organizations , being a co-founder of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and editor and founder of Electronic World . At the same time he authored Magnetic and Dynamo-Electric Machines ( 1884 ) and translated German texts on electric motors . Lured West again , in 1884 he built the first electric plant for San Francisco . Between 1884 and 1893 he was among the first to apply electricity to mining , especially electro-metallurgy . Located in San Francisco he served as consultant to mining companies across the West . He would also patent several more pieces of mine machinery ( a ball crusher [ the `` Keith Pulverizer '' ] ) and amalgamation equipment ( the commonly used centrifugal electrical amalgamation machine ) . In San Francisco , he also sold electric motors to meet burgeoning demand , but sold out with the crash of 1893 .   
 During much of 1893-1897 he was in England trying to promote his electro-metallurgical process for the extraction of precious metals from their ores . He returned to the United States and became an advisor to Thomas Edison , based in Philadelphia . He worked on the ill-fated electro-magnetic mining operations funded by Edison . He also worked on electric extraction of copper from its ores , helping organize a company to test his process in the old copper mines of New Jersey . At the time of his death he was still director or officer in a number of mining companies , including the Metals Recovery Company and the American Mines & Venture Corporation.He married Anna Tait Swan in New York in 1860 and all three of their daughters were born in Black Hawk , Colorado—Virginia ( 1862 ) , Harriet ( 1866 ) , and Elma ( 1867 ) . None married , but taught in a college in New York City . Anna Keith died July 2 , 1909 in Philadelphia . Nathaniel Shepherd Keith died January 27 , 1925 in Philadelphia .

Friedrich Adolph Wilhelm Diesterweg ( 29 October 1790 – 7 July 1866 ) was a German educator , thinker , and progressive liberal politician , who campaigned for the secularization of schools . He is said to be precursory to the reform of pedagogy .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
 Educated at Herborn and Tübingen universities 1808-1811 , Diesterweg began teaching in 1811 . He taught at Mannheim and at Worms for about two years , and then moved to the model school in Frankfurt am Main . Later he became rector of the Latin school of Elberfeld . In 1820 , he was appointed director of the new teacher 's seminary at Mörs where he put in practice the methods of Pestalozzi . In 1832 , he was summoned to Berlin to direct the new state-schools seminary in that city . Here he proved himself a strong supporter of nonsectarian religious teaching . In 1846 , he established the Pestalozzi institution at Pankow , and the Pestalozzi societies for the support of teachers ’ widows and orphans . Because of his disagreement with the authorities regarding important phases of higher education he was in constant friction and resigned from the seminary in 1847 . In 1850 , he received a government pension . Thereafter , he continued to vigorously advocate his educational ideas through the medium of periodicals . In 1858 , he was elected to the chamber of deputies as member for the city of Berlin , and voted with the Liberal opposition .   
    
    
 == Philosophy ==   
 Diesterweg thought criticalness and responsibility were important in teaching , and sought to reform social , economic and moral aspects of education publishing the influential Pädagogisch Wollen und Sollen . He based his program on what was named the `` basic principles of the struggle for life '' that he saw in the Catholicism/Protestantism conflict . He thought there were several 'oppositions ' ( distinct choices ) that were available in the conflict which could be reduced to a single `` authority or freedom , Catholicism or Protestantism '' .   
    
 In his effort to reform schooling Diesterweg wanted to remove political and religious influence in the teaching itself and instead involve more of a social factor . He believed in the availability of education : `` First educate men , before worrying about their professional training or class , [ because ] the proletarian and the peasant should both be educated to become human beings '' ; he also believed that through education the poor could be helped . He wanted professionalization of state teachers and fought for the relative autonomy of schools ; he also had an influence on the teachers of that time through his newspaper Rheinisch Blätter .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Diesterweg was a voluminous writer on educational subjects , and was the author of various school text-books . He authored 50 books and published about 400 papers ; he has been credited with originated the phrase 'learn to do by doing ' by one source .   
 In 1851 , he founded the Pädagogisches Jahrbuch ( Yearbook of pedagogy ) in Berlin . Among his publications were :   
    
 Wegweiser zur Bildung für deutsche Lehrer ( Guide for the instruction of German teachers ; 2 vols. , 1834 ; 6th ed. , 1 vol. , 1890 )   
 Das pädagogische Deutschland ( German pedagogy ; 1836 )   
 Streitfragen auf dem Gebiete der Pädagogik ( Controversial questions in the field of pedagogy ; 1837 )

Olga Pavlovna Saltsman ( pronounced [ oʃla pax vɔsta nlaˈpɛstəm ] ; February 8, 1846 – December 22, 1907 ) was a Russian intellectual and sociologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Olga Pavlovna Saltsman was born in Saint Petersburg, to the Cheka at the time the White Army seized power in Russia in February 1848. She graduated from the University of Saint Petersburg in 1868, and later studied law, philosophy, philosophy, journalism and sociology.  
 In 1876 Saltsman established the Independent Russian Theatre, a newly founded theatre in Saint Petersburg ( now part of Kazan University ) that was co-founded by M. and E. L. Yosifovich. The independent theatre became popular, and members took to calling themselves `` the Renegade Theatre ''. In 1889 Saltsman opened the History of Socialism Society. She is the author of the classic essay `` From Proletary Socialism to the Russian Revolution '', a work that was taken up by the Comintern with a mass movement. In 1892 Saltsman wrote 'The Great Famine and the Young Revolution in Russia,'which remains a classic.  
 She was the third of six children of Alexander and Anna Saltsman, from a merchant family in St. Petersburg. At an early age Olga had an immense interest in music, and at the age of sixteen she founded her own band. She began to compose at a young age, and studied painting and rhetoric at the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg. She became active in theatre, and in 1892 was awarded the Vladimir Pozniak Prize of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg.In 1897 Saltsman began her two-volume work from the point of view of popular sociology, which she edited between 1899 and 1902. In this work she used the logic of free will in order to make Marxist theory possible. She theorised that history was based on `` reciprocal effects '' of economic competition between competing social forces. In an effort to 'raise the level of consciousness ', she opposed religious superstition and all forms of nationalism.Saltsman was the last writer to write a review of a sociological work, with her only work published being a review of Herrn Frisch's Lehrbuch der politischen Künste in 1896. In 1902, Saltsman became a member of the Inner Party, an anarcho-communist youth organization based in Moscow, and she was jailed in 1905 for her work.In 1907 Saltsman left the Communist Party and founded the independent Russian Theatre and made the Life Course into a popular course in 1905, covering a range of subjects. She published over seventy articles and a book, the People's Leader : An Ecological Approach to Man. The book was first published in 1913.She retired from the Russian stage in 1918.

 == Biography ==  
 He was the son of Samuel Francis Worthy of Warren, Vermont. He attended school in Dighton, Vermont, and at the same time took a lesson in Euclid and went on to attend Dartmouth College in the spring of 1751. He left there on account of his inexperience with mathematics and obtained an MA at Dartmouth in the summer of 1753. His previous studies, mainly at the University of Paris, were interrupted by his engagement in West India in the autumn of 1755. There he proceeded to Dresden, Germany, where he published a critical commentary on many treatises of Hermann Hoppe, and followed this expedition with a series of expeditions to French Guiana and Java, succeeding in 1762, at the beginning of which period the White Mountain in California was named. In 1763 Worthy started a voyage from Europe into Africa, which he resumed the following year with the help of Captain William Dale. He went overland on the Danube and the Striga to the extent of the British Isles, before returning to America on the following July 30, 1764. In the western part of the United States he explored in the interior, accompanied by several assistants. He arrived in San Antonio, Texas in December 1765 and was the first naturalist to visit the country, and perhaps in the history of geology to make any known discoveries there. On February 14, 1766, Worthy was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and elected a member in 1770 and subsequently the first President of that society.After living at San Antonio, Worthy died, leaving a son and a daughter.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 In 1755, Worthy published, with ten other learned men and women, the Travels of a Voyage to Europe, and South America, the Risalah of a Voyage to Egypt, and a Description of the western Continent, with the True Geography and Antiquities of America. It was published at Philadelphia by W. H. Penn, Edward Hopton, and Lewis Hopkins.  
 Worthy surveyed Colorado and part of Utah.  
 In 1769 he constructed a cannon ballast and an axiomak-puller for purpose of mining.  
 A magnetometer was employed to measure the earth's magnetic axis. He was also the first to spot Venus in June 1774.  
 In 1781, he completed a quadrant model for use by engravers. The same model has been made by Robert Wilkinson, M.D. It was taken to New York and the Philadelphia Museum.He was called by the American Association for the Advancement of Science one of the `` Truth-bearers of Science in America '', and a delegate at the Philadelphia Convention in 1791. He was one of the founders of the American Philosophical Society, the nation's first scientific society, and gave its first two annual lectures.  
 He was the foreman of a survey of the New Holland river by Thomas William Leighton, which found numerous glaciers and other topographical features.  
 He surveyed a century's worth of mining settlements in Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, and California, as well as exploring the tropics and oceans of South America.

 == Biography ==   
 Hansen 's father William G Hansen , who was a son of immigrants from Denmark , was a hardware store owner in Fresno , California . He encouraged his son 's early talent in mathematics and enthusiasm for electronics . He entered Stanford University at the age of 16 , earning his B.A . in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1933.Hansen went on to become interested in the problem of accelerating electrons for X-ray experiments , using oscillating fields , rather than large static voltages . At the University of California , Berkeley , Ernest Lawrence and his assistant David H. Sloan , had worked on an accelerator driven by a resonant coil . Hansen proposed replacing the coil with a cavity resonator . In 1937 , brothers Russel H. Varian and Sigurd F. Varian came to Stanford to work on the foundations of what was to become radar . Hansen exploited some of the Varian 's work to develop the klystron and during the years 1937 to 1940 , along with collaborators such as John R. Woodyard , founded the field of microwave electronics .   
 In 1941 , he moved his team to the Sperry Gyroscope Company where they spent the war years employing their expertise in radar applications and in other problems.Returning to Stanford in 1945 as a full professor , he embarked on the construction of a series of linear accelerators based on klystron technology and of GeV performance . Along with the Varian brothers and Edward Ginzton , he co-founded Varian Associates in 1948 . Sadly , he was never to see the completion of the klystron project . He died at age 39 in Palo Alto , California of berylliosis and fibrosis of the lungs , caused by inhaling the beryllium used in his research . In 1947 , the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory ( HEPL ) was founded as a facility at Stanford University . The facility is designed to promote interdisciplinary enterprises across different branches of science and was named in his honor .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 In October 1938 , William Webster Hansen married Betsy Ross , who was the younger daughter of Perley Ason Ross , professor of physics at Stanford . Shortly after his death Betsy committed suicide . Their only child died six months after his birth during the fall of 1947 .

John Edward Anderson ( 1893–1966 ) was an American psychologist . He was the 52nd president of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) in 1943 , and editor of Psychological Bulletin from 1942 to 1946 . He also made significant contributions to the field of child psychology .   
    
    
 == Early Life ==   
 Anderson was born in Laramie , Wyoming ( 1893 ) and completed his undergraduate work at the University of Wyoming . He travelled east to complete his doctorate in psychology at Harvard University . After graduating , he entered military service during World War I and became the head instructor at the School of Military Psychology at Camp Greenleaf in Georgia . He married Dorothea Lynde of Chattanooga , Tennessee .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 In 1919 , Anderson was hired by Yale University . He also assumed the role of Secretary of the APA . In 1925 , he moved to the University of Minnesota to become Director of their Rockefeller-funded Institute for Child Welfare . In 1930 , he served as Chairman of the Conference Committee on the Infant and Pre-school for the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection , which resulted in twenty volumes on the progress in social welfare , health care , and educational facilities of young children . Over the course of the 1930s he published two books on child psychology and co-authored the Minnesota Occupational Scale with Florence Goodenough .   
 Anderson 's most significant scientific contributions are said to have been a 1939 article on the limitations of intelligence testing with very young children . In 1942 , he became editor of Psychological Bulletin , and he was elected president of the APA . His presidency coincided with World War II , so he was a key player in the contentious merger between the old science-oriented APA and the newer practice-oriented American Association for Applied Psychology . This marked the start of the modern APA.Relinquishing his editorship of Psychological Bulletin after a single term , Anderson immediately wrote a classic chapter on the methods of child psychology which appeared in Leonard Carmichael 's 1946 Manual of Child Psychology . He served in executive roles on number of professional and scientific organizations , including Vice President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( Section I , Psychology ) and President of the Society for Research in Child Development .   
    
    
 == Death ==   
 Anderson retired from Minnesota in 1961 and moved to Chattanooga , Tennessee , where he died after a long illness on May 10 , 1966 .

 = Edwin Cannan =   
Edwin Cannan ( 3 February 1861 , Funchal , Madeira – 8 April 1935 , Bournemouth ) , the son of David Cannan and artist Jane Cannan , was a British economist and historian of economic thought . He was a professor at the London School of Economics from 1895 to 1926 .   
 As a partisan of Jevonianism , Edwin Cannan is perhaps best known for his logical dissection and destruction of Classical theory in his famous 1894 tract A History of the Theories of Production and Distribution . Although Cannan had personal and professional difficulties with Alfred Marshall , he was still `` Marshall 's man '' at the LSE from 1895 to 1926 . During that time , particularly during his long stretch as chairman after 1907 , Edwin Cannan shepherded the LSE away from its roots in Fabian socialism into tentative Marshallianism . This period was only to last , however , until his protégé , Lionel Robbins , took over with his more `` Continental '' ideas .   
 Though Cannan , in his early years as an economist , was a critic of classical economics and an ally of interventionists , he moved sharply to the side of classical liberalism in the early 20th century . He favored a simplicity , clarity , and common sense in the exposition of economics . According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson , Cannan `` emphasised the institutional foundation of economic systems '' .

 = Robert Cooke (physician) =   
Robert Anderson Cooke ( 1880–1960 ) was an American immunologist and allergist.In 1916 Cooke and Albert Vandeveer demonstrated the role of heredity in the origins of allergy . According to Cooke , 48 % of his allergic patients had allergies in their family history . While the trait of allergy is transmitted through heredity , parents and children may be allergic to different substances .   
 In 1918 , Dr. Cooke suggested a mechanism of action for allergen injections as a `` desensitization or hyposensitization , '' analogous to tolerance achieved in experimental anaphylaxis induced in animals . This concept suggested that the injections of an increasing amount of allergen or antigen slowly neutralized those antibodies responsible for the allergic reaction .

 = Eugene Petrey =  
Eugene Christian Pietro Petrey ( Italian : [ ˈpteʁʁɪs ˈpʁɪx ˈjoʁʁɪjɪt ] ; 7 October 1752 – 8 July 1807 ) was an Italian physician, anatomist and botanist. He made an important contribution to the anatomy of the skull. He is credited as the first to observe the formation of a biopse, or `` development from incisor to ulna '' in the skull, in 1764.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Petrey was born in Palermo, on 7 October 1752. He was the nephew of the scientist Gaetano Petrey, and was also the great-great-great-great-great-grandson of the German cartographer Carl Petrey. He studied medicine in Naples under Nicola Tesla, who in turn encouraged him to follow the study of anatomy, and in the process encouraged him to be a physician. In 1774, he graduated from the University of Naples with the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. He stayed with Tesla in California, where he became acquainted with the celebrated surgeon Charles Wirth, who later helped to write his treatise, Anatomia Chimica Medicina, published in 1779. In 1784, he was elected a member of the Entomological Society of London, and in 1789 became its inaugural president. The name `` Petrey '' was probably proposed by Wirth, who became his assistant.Petrey practiced anatomy in Montpellier from 1792 until his death, when he moved to Florence, where he published A Neue Anatomie zu Vienna ( A New Anatomy of Vienna ). From 1793 until his death, Petrey was Secretary of the Royal Society of Medicine, and in 1797, he was President of the Academy of Medicine.

 = Giovanni Maria Lancisi =   
Giovanni Maria Lancisi ( 26 October 1654 – 20 January 1720 ) was an Italian physician , epidemiologist and anatomist who made a correlation between the presence of mosquitoes and the prevalence of malaria . He was also known for his studies about cardiovascular diseases , and is remembered in the eponymous Lancisi 's sign .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Giovanni Maria Lancisi ( Latin name : Johannes Maria Lancisius ) was educated at the Collegio Romano and the University of Rome , where he qualified in medicine aged 18 . He was physician to Popes Innocent XI , Clement XI and Innocent XII . He was given the lost anatomical plates of Bartolomeo Eustachius by Pope Clement XI ; these were made in 1562 and had been forgotten in the Vatican Library . Lancisi edited and published them in 1714 as the Tabulae anatomicae . He studied epidemiology , describing malaria and influenza epidemics . He published De Noxiis Paludum Effluviis ( On the Noxious Effluvia of Marshes ) in 1717 , in which he recognized that mosquito-infested swamps are the breeding ground for malaria and recommended drainage of these areas to prevent it . He also published extensively on cardiology , describing vegetations on heart valves , cardiac syphilis , aneurysms and the classification of heart disease . His landmark De Motu Cordis et Aneurysmatibus was published posthumously in 1728.Early in the 18th century , Lancisi had protested the medieval approaches to containing rinderpest in cattle by stating that `` it is better to kill all sick and suspect animals , instead of allowing the disease to spread in order to have enough time and the honour to discover a specific treatment that is often searched for without any success '' ( Mantovani and Zanetti , 1993 ) . Lancisi who made the first breakthrough in the control of rinderpest ( Lancisi , 1715 ) , a procedure that was later adopted by Thomas Bates ( Bates , 1718 ) .   
 However , Lancisi also erred , as he disputed the work of Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo ( 1663-1696 ) , his contemporary , who had correctly identified the cause of scabies as a parasite . Lancisi however felt scabies was of humoral origin . Because of Lancisi ’ s powerful position and , because previous scientists like Galileo Galilei had fallen into disgrace , Bonomo was silenced and his discovery was forgotten until the modern era .   
    
    
 == Brain & Soul Inquiries ==   
 Lancisi described the corpus callosum as the `` seat of the soul , which imagines , deliberates and judges . '' His Dissertatio Physiognomica provided the supporting argument in 1713 . He opposed alternative locations of the soul as hypothesized by others , such as the centrum ovale , by Andreas Vesalius , and the pineal gland , by René Descartes . He hypothesized that the Longitudinal striae ( later named in his honor as the `` striae lancisi '' or `` nerves of Lancisi '' ) were the conduit between the anterior location of the soul , and the posterior location of sensory organ functions , both within the corpus callosum .

She was born in Salem , India , and her father was the Collector of the District , M. D. Cockburn . The family initially visited Kotagiri in summer but settled permanently around 1855 at `` Hope Park '' . Cockburn experimented on tea planting at Alports Estate and made numerous observations on local natural history and many of these were reported in the works of Allan Octavian Hume . She also made paintings of local birds and flora . The Natural History Museum , London , produced a diary in 2002 with illustrations made by her of the fauna and flora of the Kotagiri region . A collection of butterflies was also bequeathed to the Natural History Museum .   
 She set up the first school for Badagas and contributed towards the construction of a church at Kotagiri in 1867 which was later taken over by the Basel Mission .

 Berthoud was born at La Sarne, in the Nîmes. His father was a ‘ gold-smith ’ ; his mother, Marguerite Berthoud, was a mathematician. He was educated in the Tuileries, at the end of which his book was translated into English. In his youth he loved political economy, both in the framework of individualism and empiricism, and became an amateur economist. In 1793, when the Revolution of 1789 was still just beginning, he headed the Committee for Public Credit, which published a pamphlet entitled “ Economics and Political Economy. ” In addition to the influence of this publication, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly, which established the Council of State in 1789. In June 1789 he worked with Jacob de Graaff on a book on education for children entitled “ Etudes physiologiques sur l ’ éducation générale. ” This work is still in print and has been translated into various languages. He went on to write what is known as the Berthoud-Leverist ’ – the view that the experience of childhood is a leading factor in the development of reason.  
 In 1803 Berthoud became a member of the American Philosophical Society, and was promoted to full member in 1807. He was awarded the Jean de Heverie medal by the British Academy in 1824. His expositions on philosophy and economics form the second and third volumes of his three-volume treatise on the subject. One of his pupils was the painter Frederick Strahan. He was elected to the French Academy in 1816 and served for one term as rector of the Faculty of Philosophy at Paris. In 1823 he was elected to the Académie française, and was made a member the following year. In 1833 he was the first member of the English Academy of Sciences. His final publication was Des Études de l ’ l ’ École d'Econometrique sur l ’ a du cantique du Politique et l ’ a du Pédagogie, and of his history of the French intellectual life.He died on 29 October 1854 in Paris, leaving behind a wife and five children.

 = Ernst Stueckelberg =   
Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg ( baptised as Johann Melchior Ernst Karl Gerlach Stückelberg , full name after 1911 : Baron Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg von Breidenbach zu Breidenstein und Melsbach ; 1 February 1905 – 4 September 1984 ) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist , regarded as one of the most eminent physicists of the 20th century . Despite making key advances in theoretical physics , including the exchange particle model of fundamental forces , causal S-matrix theory , and the renormalization group , his idiosyncratic style and publication in minor journals led to his work being unrecognized until the mid-1990s .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Born into a semi-aristocratic family in Basel in 1905 , Stueckelberg 's father was a lawyer , and his paternal grandfather a distinguished Swiss artist . A highly gifted school student , Stueckelberg initially began a physics degree at the University of Basel in 1923 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 While still a student , Stueckelberg was invited by the distinguished quantum theorist Arnold Sommerfeld , to attend his lectures at the University of Munich . He went on to gain a Ph.D. on cathode physics in 1927 . Later that year he went to Princeton University , becoming an assistant professor in 1930 .   
 He returned to Switzerland in 1932 , working first at the University of Basel before switching the following year to the University of Zurich . In 1934 he moved again to the University of Geneva , which together with the University of Lausanne became his principal bases for the rest of his career .   
 Stueckelberg 's sojourn in Zurich led to contact with leading quantum theorists Wolfgang Pauli and Gregor Wentzel , which in turn led him to focus on the emerging theory of elementary particles .   
 In 1934 he devised a fully Lorentz-covariant perturbation theory for quantum fields . The approach proposed by Stueckelberg was very powerful , but was not adopted by others at the time , and has now been all but forgotten . However , besides being explicitly covariant , Stueckelberg 's methods avoid vacuum bubbles.Stueckelberg developed the vector boson exchange model as the theoretical explanation of the strong nuclear force in 1935 . Discussions with Pauli led Stueckelberg to drop the idea , however . It was rediscovered by Hideki Yukawa , who won a Nobel Prize for his work in 1949 — the first of several Nobel Prizes awarded for work which Stueckelberg contributed to , without recognition.In 1938 Stueckelberg recognized that massive electrodynamics contains a hidden scalar , and formulated an affine version of what would become known as the Abelian Higgs mechanism . He also proposed the law of conservation of baryon number.The evolution parameter theory he presented in 1941 and 1942 is the basis for recent work in relativistic dynamics .   
 In 1941 he proposed the interpretation of the positron as a positive energy electron traveling backward in time.In 1943 he came up with a renormalization program to attack the problems of infinities in quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) , but his paper was rejected by the Physical Review.In 1952 he proved the principle of semi-detailed balance for kinetics without microscopic reversibility.In 1953 he and the mathematician André Petermann discovered the renormalization group.In 1976 he was awarded the Max Planck medal.His PhD students included Marcel Guénin .

 Munger was born in Chicago, Illinois, and moved with his family to New York City in 1921. His father, William Melvin Munger, was an assistant to Charles Eliot Ness, who would go on to found the National Academy of Sciences in 1937. Munger's father worked at General Foods, an international food company, where he was Vice President of Research and Development for the Nutrition Division. Robert Munger was educated at O'Hare High School and the University of Chicago. He obtained his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1952, before returning to Chicago to begin a tenure-track position at General Foods as associate professor in biochemistry in 1953. At the time, the relationship between dietetics and biochemistry was a controversy, but it was solidified when it was discovered that dietetics actually had no bearing on biochemistry.  
 Munger joined the faculty of Brown University in 1954, and became the first Director of the Biodestination Laboratory. He left the lab in 1961 for the position of Director of the Molecular Biology and Nutrition Division at the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) in Washington, D.C., where he would retire in 1961. He was a founding member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ). Munger has been a critic of the FDA's restriction of food research for its efficacy. Munger is also an opponent of its ethical concerns with organ transplantation.

 = Ingeborg Beling =   
Ingeborg Beling was a German ethologist from the early 20th century who worked in the field of chronobiology . She studied at the University of Munich under the direction of Karl Von Frisch and is known for her research on the time sense of honey bees .   
 In her research , in 1929 , she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day , day after day . This contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees ’ 24-hour biological clock . Because of this achievement , she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists . Beyond honeybees , much of Beling ’ s work involved studying behaviors of wasps , fly pupae , etc . Finally , she also did some research in pest control .   
    
    
 == Bee-feeding experiment ( 1929 ) ==   
 Beling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper , titled `` Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen '' ( “ On the Time Memory of Bees ” ) published in the Journal of Comparative Physiology , that the early observations of Forel , v. Buttel-Reepen and Dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees , termed Zeitgedächtnis , or time memory . In her pioneer experiments , Beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish , which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day ( for example , between 4 and 6 PM ) . During the testing phase , the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded . She found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time , even when the sugar water was removed . Specifically , Beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning . Further more , she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day , and even for multiple times a day . However , Beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours , but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested . These results were still present when Beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity , temperature , light and radiation .   
    
    
 == Contributions to chronobiology ==   
 Beling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time . She found that this time memory is both rigorous ( the bees consistently show up at the expected time ) and flexible ( the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day , even two or three times a day ) . Beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours . This 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous , helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day . The bees ' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day , the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response . Beling ’ s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a Zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments .   
    
    
 == Related terms ==   
 Much of the early work in chronobiology was done in Germany , so publications were largely written in German . Some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today . The father of chronobiology , Colin Pittendrigh , critiqued these terms , saying that researchers in Munich have trouble letting go of these terms . He argues that ‘ training ’ and ‘ memory ’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior .   
    
    
 == Related chronobiologists ==   
 Beling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees . Her work grew from the observations of previous scientists ( Forel , Buttel-Reepen , von Frisch ) and helped inspire further experimentation ( Wahl , Renner ) . Standing on the shoulders of these researchers , Pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology .

 = Theodor Meynert =   
Theodor Hermann Meynert ( 15 June 1833 – 31 May 1892 ) was a German-Austrian psychiatrist , neuropathologist and anatomist born in Dresden . Meynert believed that disturbances in brain development could be a predisposition for psychiatric illness and that certain psychoses are reversible .   
 In 1861 he earned his medical doctorate , and in 1875 became director of the psychiatric clinic associated with the University of Vienna . Some of his better known students in Vienna were Josef Breuer , Sigmund Freud , who in 1883 worked at Meynert 's psychiatric clinic , and Julius Wagner-Jauregg , who introduced fever treatment for syphilis . Meynert later distanced himself from Freud because of the latter 's involvement with practices such as hypnosis . Meynert also ridiculed Freud 's idea of male hysteria ; though some authors believe this to be due to his own hidden suffering of the illness , prompting a reconciliation with Freud near to his death . Other famous students of Meynert 's were Russian neuropsychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff ( 1854–1900 ) , German neuropathologist Carl Wernicke ( 1848–1905 ) and Swiss neuroanatomist Auguste-Henri Forel ( 1848–1931 ) . Meynert 's work was an important influence in the career of German neuropathologist Paul Flechsig ( 1847–1929 ) .   
    
    
 == Brain research ==   
 Meynert 's work was largely focused on brain anatomy , pathology and histology , including the mapping of its intricate pathways and topography . He made many contributions involving the study of the cellular architecture of the brain and is often considered to be the founder of cerebral cortex cytoarchitectonics .   
 Meynert developed theories in regards to correlations between neuroanatomical and mental processes . He conceptualized that a coupling between one mental association and its temporal successor as a literal contact between cortical nerve cells linked to one other by nerve fibers , and a series of cortical associations could therefore be construed as being a `` train of thought '' . He also theorized that ideas and memories are to be envisioned as being attached to specific cortical cells .   
    
 In regards to mental illness , Meynert conceptualized that a conflict existed between the cerebral cortex and the sub-cortical regions as the primary cause for abnormal function of cerebral components . Also he formulated that a causal connection existed between cerebral pathologies and psychoses due to a lack of `` cerebral nutrition '' related to vasomotor functionality . Meynert 's aim was to establish psychiatry as an exact science based on anatomy . In his 1884 textbook Psychiatrie . Klinik der Erkrankungen des Vorderhirns , Meynert forewords with the statement : '' The reader will find no other definition of 'Psychiatry ' in this book but the one given on the title page : Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the Forebrain . The historical term for psychiatry , i.e. , 'treatment of the soul , ' implies more than we can accomplish , and transcends the bounds of accurate scientific investigation . ''   
    
    
 == Anatomical terms ==   
 He has several anatomical structures named after him , including the basal optic nucleus of Meynert , the substantia innominata of Meynert and `` Meynert cells '' , which are solitary pyramidal cells located in the cerebral cortex near the calcarine fissure . In 1869 Meynert described the dorsal tegmental decussation of the left and right tectospinal and tectobulbar tracts , located in the mesencephalon ( midbrain ) . This was to become known as `` Meynert 's decussation '' or as `` fountain decussation '' .

He studied at Halle University of Technology and received his doctorate from it in 1873, three years before he met Marietta Frederick Willan, and did a year's study of child psychology at the London University. Dorrfeld lectured at the University of Bonn in 1875-76, and in 1877 he was accepted for a professorship of child psychology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. As a result of teaching at Berlin and Berlin University, he received a special grant for teaching comparative psychology and psychoneuroses in 1883. The theoretical foundation of these two disciplines had to wait for a response from Karl-Heinrich Uhlenberg.  
 In 1889, while working in the Theilfenzalakademie in Berlin, he translated Naming and Nomenclature of the Animals, an essay on ontogeny into German.From 1890 until 1898 he served as head of the psychoanalytic department at Halle University of Technology, and he retired in 1901. In 1894 he was elected an honorary member of the German Psychological Society.He made important contributions to the study of child psychology through his contribution to the emergence of the concept of behavioral change.He died at Halle.

 = Christian Ernst Stahl =   
Christian Ernst Stahl ( 21 June 1848 – 3 December 1919 ) was a German botanist who was a native of Schiltigheim , Alsace .   
    
    
 == Academic career ==   
 He studied botany at the University of Strasbourg with Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet ( 1838-1902 ) , and at the University of Halle under Anton de Bary ( 1831-1888 ) . He earned his doctorate in 1874 , and later became an assistant to Julius von Sachs ( 1832-1897 ) at the University of Würzburg . He was appointed an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg , and after just one year , he attained the chair of botany at the University of Jena in 1881 . Here , he also served as director of the botanical garden .   
 During the winter of 1889-1890 , he took a scientific expedition to Ceylon and Java , and in 1894 travelled to Mexico . Two of his better-known students were Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch ( 1867-1941 ) and Hans Kniep ( 1881-1930 ) .   
    
    
 == Botanical research ==   
 Stahl is remembered for his pioneer experiments in the field of ecophysiology , as well as research involving the developmental history of lichens . He was able to induce the synthesis of the lichen Endocarpon pusillum from spores and algal material , including formation of apothecia , and thus he made a strong experimental case for the hypothesis by Simon Schwendener ( 1829-1919 ) that lichens are twin fungal-algal organisms.Other contributions by Stahl included studies concerning the influence of light on plants — he described the anatomy of sun and shade leaves ; the effects of moisture and dryness on the formation of leaves , and the role of stomata in xerophytes and mesophytes . He conducted important research on the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and tree roots , and also worked on plant defense against snail and slug herbivory and a plethora of other botanical and ecological questions .

Raimundo Germán Olabide Karrera , S.J . ( 15 March 1869 - Toulouse 9 September 1942 ) was a Basque Jesuit priest , linguistic and translator . He authored a complete translation of the Bible into the Basque language .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Olabide was born in 1869 in Vitoria , Álava , Spain , to a couple who lived on the Plaza de la Virgen Blanca in the center of the city , where they ran a small business . Though both his parents were ethnically Basque , his mother had been born and raised in Madrid , and her native tongue was Castillian . As a result , he grow up speaking only that language . When he came of age , his parents sent him to the Jesuit college in Urduña.In 1884 , at the age of 15 , Olabide entered the Society of Jesus which operated the school . He then pursued his philosophical and theological studies at the Jesuit communities of Veruela Abbey and Tortosa . In the course as his formation with the Society , he worked as a teacher in Valladolid , Oña , Gijon and Salamanca . He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1902.It was while studying at the University of Salamanca in 1911 that Olabide came across a grammar book of Basque written by Arturo Campión , a leading proponent of Basque nationalism . It was then finally that , at the age of 27 , he began to learn his mother tongue , to the study and promotion of which he dedicated the rest of his life . The noted Basque lexographer who had published a classic dictionary of the language in 1904 , Resurrección María de Azkue , later commented that Olabide seemed to know his work better than he himself , the author , did .   
    
    
 == Translator ==   
 In 1914 Olabide published his first translation into that language , that of the noted Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola , in Basque Loyola'tar Eneko Deunaren Gogo-iñarkunak . Three years later , he published a complete dictionary of human anatomy Giza-soña ( The Human Body ) . His translations became noted for the purity of his language , as he refused to use loanwords from other languages . He was admitted to the Royal Academy of the Basque language in 1919 due to his contributions to the revival of the language .   
 The following year , Olabide published his translation into the Basque of the medieval spiritual classic , Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis , with the title of Kisto'ren antz-bidea . His goal had become the publishing of translations across the entire range of the sciences , so as to advance the use of the language .   
 Olabide , however , then made the decision to embark on a translation of the Bible . The New Testament took him ten years ; it was published in 1931 in Bilbao . After the expulsion of the Jesuits in the course of the Spanish Civil War , he took shelter at the Franciscan Sanctuary of Arantzazu in Oñati , where he devoted himself to the translation of the Old Testament . By chance , he was living in the city of Guernica on 26 April 1937 when the German Luftwaffe conducted its attack on the city . He was able to save his manuscripts from his residence before it was destroyed by fire and escaped to the nearby town of Kanala , where he was given refuge in the rectory of the town . He then left Spain and settled in Toulouse , France , where he died as the result of an accident on the streets of the city.The translation on which Olabide had been working at the town of his death was completed by a fellow Jesuit , Patxi Etxeberria , who was brought back from missionary service in Taiwan for this effort . It was published in 1958 .

George Young ( 15 July 1777 – 8 May 1848 ) was a Scottish divine , scholar and flood geologist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 George Young was born in Kirknewton south-west of Edinburgh to John Young and his wife Jean . George was born without a left hand and this situation led his parents to educate him for the ministry.At the University of Edinburgh he distinguished himself in mathematics and natural philosophy . He was a favorite student of Professor John Playfair who was , at that time , becoming the great promoter of James Hutton 's uniformitarian geology . After receiving high honors upon completion of his degree in 1796 , he studied theology under Dr George Lawson at Selkirk for five years , receiving at the end of this period a licence to preach from the Presbytery of Glasgow . In 1806 he became the pastor of the Cliff Street chapel in Whitby where he served for 42 years . He obtained an M.A . degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1819 . In 1826 he married Margaret Hunter . Though married for 20 years they had no children .   
 Young could read and write Hebrew , Greek , Latin , French , and Italian with some acquaintance with Arabic , Chaldean and Syriac , and he developed his own shorthand , which is still undecipherable . He helped establish Whitby Museum as the first secretary and a founding member of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society . He procured fossil and mineral collections for the Yorkshire Philosophical Society .   
 Young wrote twenty-two books on many topics : inter alia , the history of Whitby ; the great solar eclipse of 1836 ; an acclaimed biography of Captain James Cook ; the downfall of Napoleon ; and , a catalog of hardy garden plants .   
 With John Bird as artist he wrote A Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast in 1822 published in Whitby . This book remains in print in facsimile . A second edition ( 1828 ) was printed and published in the north of England , Edinburgh , and London . The second edition contains seventeen plates : numbers one to fifteen , and number seventeen , are on one page , and number sixteen is a two-page spread . The plates are hand-coloured with watercolour : brush-strokes are clearly visible . The effect is exquisite and may reflect Young 's passion for geology , and Bird 's art.The title was followed by Scriptural Geology in 1838 .   
 George Young was immersed in fossil collecting and selling . He helped preserve preserving the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and museum . He promoted fossil collecting saying , `` The researches of the geologist are far from being unworthy of the Christian , or the philosopher : for , while they enlarge the bounds of our knowledge , and present a wide field for intellectual employment and innocent pleasure , they may serve to conduct us to the glorious Being . '' R.J. Cleevely stated that Young `` questioned many of the facts concerning fossils , sedimentation and geological time ” of the Yorkshire coast , such as the facts that the strata had been deposited by water , and that the horizontally deposited strata had become tilted by some violent force . Young did not object to these facts , but to interpretations of them by contemporary geologists.On 8 May 1848 , two years after the death of his wife , George Young died of influenza at the age of 71 years .

Abbie William Turner ( 1891-1939 ) was a British physicist who worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City.She earned her PhD in Physics from the University of Edinburgh in 1916, at the age of 24, under the supervision of Henry Cockcroft, a young and ambitious young civil servant. Her research at the Laboratory of Electromagnetic Research ( London ) was very influential in the development of the electro-magnetic revolution. She was a pre-eminent scientific figure during the second world war, and a confidant to wartime scientists.  
 She was the first woman to take part in what became known as the `` demarcation '' of the three `` races '' of man. Her work with Joseph Elvin Shapiro made the previously one-sided nature of this `` division '' untenable. She published one of the first laws of physics in 1916, giving a mathematical basis for the ionosphere and mesosphere. In 1918, she proposed that the electrically charged particles responsible for aurora borealis must also be responsible for precipitation. Her work was received with cautious enthusiasm in Britain. In January 1919, Turner was arrested by the Home Office for contempt of court. As a consequence of this and later 'investigations ', Turner was arrested for having taken part in the `` League of Nations '''s Conference at Hanoi, along with the editors of the Evening Standard, the Daily Telegraph and the Saturday Mirror. This led to her being acquitted of contempt in 1924. Turner was also censured by the British press for her alleged involvement in the creation of a `` war school '' at Edinburgh for black soldiers, likely using them as guinea pigs in development of machine gun sights and communication equipment.  
 She died on 12 February 1939 in the Weehawken, New Jersey home of her friend Mary Anne Roff.

He is noted for his studies of specific resistance mechanisms that occur in particular and concomitant taxa of Acer of the family Lacerta and his work in the characterization of the acaryophytes from Elata, Oregon.  
 Snow was the first to study the thermal properties of specific glands of the leaves of Lamiaceae, and in the summer of 1939 he flew over the southeastern United States and studied the areas where bees were pollinating various crops. He discovered that bees mostly rely on leaf-gland heat exchange in support of reproduction and ant exchange.  
 Snow participated in the first Surgeon General ’ s Occupational Health Study to collect the `` pulse '' of tuberculosis patients. He was also involved in the establishment of Health Resources Division, serving as the Secretary and head of the Division for health care administration from 1942 to 1946. He also served as the editor of Physiological Plant Manuscripts of the M.R.I. Department of Biology ( 1950 ) and Health Facilities of the Corps of Engineers ( 1952-1959 ).

 = Tristan Stenberg =  
Tristan Christopher Stenberg, ZTAGNA ( 15 November 1778 – 11 November 1863 ), was an Irish Catholic priest and mycologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Stenberg was born in Great Barrow near Wicklow, Ireland, then part of a parish called Bram All Quarries. His father was Dr. Robert Stenberg of Closeallsdale and a farmer from the Dunbar home there. His elder brother, also named Robert, was parish priest of Fhegna in County Kildare. Tristan was the second of three sons. His father died when he was nine years old. Tristan then attended St. Columba's Grammar School at the Westlimber Archdiocese of Kilkenny. On a study trip he received a scholarship from his parents to study at St. Peter's College, Cork. He had always been interested in mycology. His family then moved back to Sligo and his studies there were interrupted by World War I. He returned to Ireland and married Elizabeth Braithwaite in 1802. They had three sons. His first marriage was to Catherine Peebles, a University of Clare woman. He then moved to Ballina to study mathematics with William Andover Gregory. When he returned to Cork, he joined the University of Bantry in 1812 and took his doctorate from Cambridge in 1813.  
 In 1817 he moved to India and worked on various scientific papers, including one on the biotaxy of the common dwarf roseae.  
 He made a trip to Kilchangra, Western Ghats during the February-March of 1823, investigating the cold formation of Lake Kulkarni.  
   
 He was ordained a priest in St. Stephen's Basilica of Heidelberg in 1826. He taught physics, chemistry and mathematical sciences at the University of Adelaide.  
   
 In 1829 he left Adelaide and settled at Rathtinagar, Kootenay County, British Columbia.  
 He undertook field research in southwestern Saskatchewan ( south-central Alberta ), exploring the Crowsnest Pass. He became an authority on grizzly bear and cohoing population health, analysing captive specimens and early field releases. This work resulted in the introduction in British Columbia of the gray-headed bushy ground squirrel in 1829. He is credited with making a major contribution to the knowledge of the forest ground squirrels in the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and northern Quebec and the discovery of morphological and physiological similarities between North American black bears and species from the rainforest interior of southern Venezuela, although these similarities were probably false. He published on the identification of the Columbian lynx, being the first to name the land mammal.As a professor, he introduced mycology to Canada and to the United States, pioneering the study of fungi in mycology, which had previously been poorly studied and not well supported by the general public.  
 From 1831 to 1854 Stenberg worked at the botanical gardens of Toulouse, and in 1836 became curator at the New York Botanical Gardens.Stenberg died in August 1863 at Palms, New Mexico, and was buried in St. Luke's Churchyard, Carrick-on-Shannon.  
 He was the son of Robert Stenberg of Bunheran and Charlotte Catharine Stenberg. His sisters were Agnes, wife of the botanist M.C. Burt, and Bernice, wife of the botanist, W.R.C. Whitney.

 = Karl Saul Bockert =  
Karl Saul Bockert ( 25 September 1858, Copenhagen – 18 July 1917, Lemberg ) was a Danish neurologist, one of the founders of the neuropathology branch of the Swedish anatomical system, one of the most distinguished of the leading figures in the history of neurology, and one of the first psychologists to develop the concepts of human neurophysiology.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bockert was born in Copenhagen. He obtained his medical doctorate in 1894 and his neurology doctorate in 1898. From 1896 to 1898 he worked in the neurology department of the Odense University. From 1902 to 1905 he was an assistant at the Royal Veterinary Hospital and from 1905 to 1906 he was a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  
 From 1909 to 1918 he was director of the mental hospital of the Royal Orthopedic School, Copenhagen. He was the first Danish author to develop concepts of physiology in association with clinical problems ( in 1914 his book Symbolic Anatomy of the Brain as a Treatise of Diseases ). During the Second World War he moved to London to take up positions at the Hôpital Theoretical Institute and the Institute of Comparative Anatomy of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain.  
 After the war, Bockert devoted himself entirely to clinical research and began to focus on aspects of human brain anatomy. In 1904, the Chair of Neurology at the University of Copenhagen was created, and in 1924 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.  
 In 1919 he became the first professor of neurological pathology in Sweden. He served as the first president of the board of health of the Royal Norwegian Society for Neurology and Neurosurgery ( Norwegian : Kristiannekrående kirke fornar våldligt, for doctorologisch optik och och neuroptikar ), and he was a member of the Board of Neurological Research of the Swedish National Board of Health ( Norsk ). He was the medical superintendent of the Karls Region's Special Pediatric Unit of the Royal Pediatric Hospital in Gävle. Bockert and his son Gustaf Bockert Kinturkert founded the psychological hospital and hospital depts.  
 He died on 18 July 1917, the father of the Swedish neurologist Gustaf Bockert, who wrote the book Svenska stålligt ( The Pain-Relief Society ) in recognition of Bockert's contributions to psychology and neurology.

 = Moses Reinke =  
Moses Reinke ( 13 October 1889 – 9 March 1969 ) was a Jewish theologian and minister.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Moses Reinke was born in Sigdrup, Denmark in 1889. He was the son of Hermann Reinke, a member of the underground railroad system, and his wife, Rebekah Kay. He studied at the University of Copenhagen, receiving a doctorate in 1896.  
 In 1896, while still in Copenhagen, Reinke became a Lutheran pastor in Netreb utgård in Aalborg. Two years later, Reinke began publishing his theological works, under the pen name Manfred-Isaac Lenz. His discourses on theology in the Encyclopædia Britannica of the University of Copenhagen reached more than 250,000 copies. Reinke's work on the `` holy book '', the Holy Scriptures ( also known as The Berufganges Mysteriæ Encyclopædia Britannica ), was the first significant text-critical and text-critical textual study of the Old Testament. Other publications by him in the period were the commentary on Isaiah and the books of Esther and Jonah, the commentary on Psalm 145 ( 1894 ) and the commentary on Jonah, which also came under the pseudonym Lenz.  
 He spent the next three years in Germany, mainly in Berlin, before coming to Denmark in 1897. In 1897, he became a doctor of philosophy at the University of Copenhagen, and was then made dean of the Norwegian Faculty of Religious Education. He took part in a seminar on the ordeals of Judaism in Copenhagen in 1897. In 1900, he became the first priest in the church in Netreb, and served as rector from 1903 until 1906.  
 From 1908 he devoted himself to preaching the Gospel to the Jews of Denmark. In 1909 he was engaged in pastoral work at the General Synod of the Church of Denmark. In 1909 he became a member of the High Court of Justice and as a court judge, he published about 100 articles. He is known for writing the book The Great Mystery, in Danish. In 1912 he co-founded the Academic Council for Theological and Epistolic Culture.  
 In 1916 he was appointed minister of the Norwegian Church in Germany, and in 1920-22 he was acting president of the chapter of the congregation in Jerusalem. In 1925 he became head of the Norwegian Union in the All-Christian Union of the United Nations.After the Nansen movement ended in Germany, Reinke was invited to lead a conference in which he would attempt to find the Holy Grail. In 1934, he was forced to resign after an incident at the conference. He went on to teach at the University of Oslo. He died at his home in Kalmar in 1969.

Maximilien Chaudoir , or Maximilien , baron de Chaudoir , ( 12 September 1816 , Ivnitsa , near Zhitomir – 6 May 1881 , Amélie-les-Bains ) was a Russian entomologist . He was a specialist in Coleoptera and in particular the Carabidae . His Cicindelidae are conserved by the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris . His Carabidae were acquired by Charles Oberthür ( 1845-1924 ) , then given to the same museum . He wrote Mémoire sur la famille des Carabiques , 6 volumes commencing 1848 .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Chaudoir was born in Ivnitza , about 30 kilometres from Jitomir , Ukraine . The family may come from a line of French Protestant emigrants who fled in 1685 or from Belgium . The subsequent roots have been traced to Antoine de Chaudoire from Poland whose son worked in the court of Stanislas-Auguste Poniatowski until his abdication in 1795 after which he moved to Bavaria where he received the hereditary title of Baron from Maximilien Joseph II in 1814 . His son Stanislav ( 1790-1858 ) married Aglae d'Erggelet and Maximilien was their only son . Stanislav was a wealthy collector who donated his books and collectibles to the Hermitage Museum . Maximilien was raised by his aunt as his mother died after his birth . Jean Wavre , a private tutor introduced him to natural history and insects . He began collecting carabid beetles in 1826 . He was sent to study law at Tartu ( Dorpat ) , although not interested in law , he knew that J.F . Eschscholtz taught zoology there . Unfortunately for him , Eschscholtz died a few weeks before he joined the university , and Chaudoir began to work on his collections at the museum . He was encouraged by Count Gustave de Mannerheim and in 1834 he travelled around Germany and met Louis Chevrolat in Hamburg . He became a member of the Entomological Society of France in 1834 . He moved to Kiev and then joined the Societe Imperiale des Naturlistes de Moscou in 1837 . In 1845 Chaudoir visited Crimea and became interested in the Caucasus region . In 1847 he became a member of the Entomologische Verein , Stettin . In 1848 he bought the Faldermann collection followed by another collection of Himalayan beetles from Captain Boys in 1850 and still later Gory 's collection in 1852.He married Elisabeth-Augusta Bockshanine on February 28 , 1856 . They had a daughter and a son . His daughter Marie however died in 1879 at the age of 22 from Tuberculosis . Chaudoir died from a stroke on 6 May 1881 and was buried next to his daughter in their family vault at Amelie-Bains-Palalda . His wife died in 1896 at Jitomir and their son died without issue in 1919 . Before his death he let his collection be available to Rene Oberthür through his friend Charles Oberthür . This collection eventually went to the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris .

 == Biography ==  
 Antipova-Fey was born in Moscow on 4 May 1919. She studied physics and mathematics at the Moscow State Institute of Science. After receiving her doctorate she joined the Soviet nuclear-weapons research group where she worked on the Sankt Rat and Sankt Meitner potentials. The main invention of the group was the development of a chemical element called poisic sodium ( `` base '' ). She also invented an anti-microbial drug. While working on the Meitner potentials, Antipova-Fey developed a filter.  
 She was the first to solve the Sankt Rat problem, and her solution achieved the logarithmic degree of the orbitals of the atom of a poisic element. She made a method of measuring the ratio of the boiling point to the melting point of solids, and provided a direct answer for Meitner's equation and related problems.In 1975, Antipova-Fey became a widow after divorcing her first husband ( Evgeni Pavlovitch Pavlovich Antipov ), who had been the head of the work group on the Sankt Rat problem, on 10 January 1975. The next year, she became a widow. Antipova-Fey died in Moscow on 10 January 2008. She is buried at Pemstvo-1 cemetery, Moscow.Antipova-Fey is credited with writing the code for developing the first non-mechanical device, an infrared locator.

 = Franz von Langlais =  
Franz von Langlais ( 26 January 1635 – 21 April 1714 ), the Protestant theologian, was born in Sibley, near the Rhine, and went into the service of the Protestant Reformed Church from 1654 to 1671.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was the son of Stephan von Langlais, a teacher at the Reformed Gymnasium in Sibley, and his wife, Maria Gotthilf von Langlais. His father, like his mother, was a freethinker. His paternal grandfather, the priest Pietro Langlais, was a radical theologian and preacher in Neuen Artin.  
 At the age of six he was converted to the views of Luther. He obtained a preliminary university education in Sibley, and in 1655 undertook a course in theology with Samuel Koldenberg, whereupon he was ordained in 1658. His degree of Doctor of Divinity from the university, in August 1662, was probably due largely to his advocacy of the Reformed doctrines of justification by faith, free choice, and justification by faith alone, as opposed to the Calvinistic doctrines and dogmatics.  
   
   
 == Ecclesiastical career ==  
 He was for some years professor of philosophy in Neuen Artin, and in 1662 took up the rectorate of Duisburg. His theology had greatly improved, and he afterwards delivered the episcopal college sermon at the palace of Gotha. He was also indefatigable in the organization of churches. In 1672 he was appointed professor of theology at the imperial university of Bucharest, and a minister of the Church of Romania at Bucharest, from which he retired in 1694.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 His major works are the work De ibitur rectis doctrinae ( Erlangen, 1694 ), on the construction of the creed of justification, which was to become, in the course of its operations, the text of such Protestant treatises as Utrius Melanchthon and the works of Christoph Schlegel.

 Differentiating the L-J potential with respect to r gives an expression for the net inter-molecular force between 2 molecules . This inter-molecular force may be attractive or repulsive , depending on the value of r. When r is very small , the molecules repel each other .   
 Whereas the functional form of the attractive term has a clear physical justification , the repulsive term has no theoretical justification . It is used because it approximates the Pauli repulsion well and is more convenient due to the relative computing efficiency of calculating r12 as the square of r6 .   
 The L-J potential is a relatively good approximation . Due to its simplicity , it is often used to describe the properties of gases and to model dispersion and overlap interactions in molecular models . It is especially accurate for noble gas atoms and is a good approximation at long and short distances for neutral atoms and molecules .   
 The lowest-energy arrangement of an infinite number of atoms described by a Lennard-Jones potential is a hexagonal close-packing . On raising temperature , the lowest-free-energy arrangement becomes cubic close packing , and then liquid . Under pressure , the lowest-energy structure switches between cubic and hexagonal close packing . Real materials include body-centered cubic structures also.The Lennard-Jones ( 12,6 ) potential was improved by the Buckingham potential ( exp-6 ) later proposed by Richard Buckingham , incorporating an extra parameter and the repulsive part is replaced by an exponential function :

Frederic Vester ( November 23 , 1925 – November 2 , 2003 ) was a German biochemist , and an expert in the field of ecology .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Vester was born in Saarbrücken , and studied chemistry at the universities of Mainz , Paris and Hamburg . From 1955 to 1957 he was postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and Cambridge . From 1957 to 1966 he worked at Saarland University , Saarbrücken , and from 1969 he worked in Munich , first at the Max Planck Institute . In 1970 he founded the private Munich-based Frederic Vester Studiengruppe für Biologie und Umwelt GmbH ( `` Frederic Vester Study Group for Biology and Environment , Ltd. ) , renamed Frederic Vester GmbH ( `` Frederic Vester , Ltd. '' ) after his death .   
 From 1982 to 1989 he was a professor at the Bundeswehr University Munich , and from 1989 to 1991 he was Professor for Applied Economics at the Hochschule St. Gallen , Switzerland . Vester 's ideas influenced the formation of the environmental movement and the Green Party in Germany . He was a member of the Club of Rome . He was married to Anne Vester . The couple had three children and six grandchildren . He died in Munich .

 === Networked Thinking ===   
 Vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking , a combination of cybernetic and systemic ideas and complexity . Central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects , leading to emergent behavior of the system as a whole . These networks can be described by using protocols , mathematical networks , computer software , so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations , including positive and negative feedback loops . Simulations of systemic networks can help to decide the long-term effects of singular measures .   
    
    
 === The Sensitivity Model ===   
 Vester 's Sensitivity Model combines these ideas , and has been used since the 1980s in studies by Ford , UNESCO and other organizations .

 = Robert C. Woodhouse =  
Robert C. Woodhouse ( July 6, 1859 – October 9, 1944 ) was an American biologist known for his studies of fungi, plant diseases and pollination. He was a professor of botany and later director of the College of Agricultural Sciences in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Woodhouse was born in 1859 to Maria and Hamilton Woodhouse, who ran a funeral parlor. His father worked as a plumber, and his mother moved away with him to live with his family after the death of his father. He earned his bachelor's degree from Wisconsin Wesleyan College, and his Ph.D. in physiology from the University of Wisconsin in 1908. In 1909, he married Caroline Poncelet, who was born in Mexico. They moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1910, where they lived for the next eight years. They would remain there for the rest of his life.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After graduating from Wisconsin Wesleyan College, Woodhouse went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked in zoology and biology, eventually becoming a staff research botanist and resident botanist at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1916, he was promoted to assistant professor of biology at the college, where he later became a full professor in 1919.  
 In his career, Woodhouse identified many plant diseases that had important role in aiding the livestock industry, and helped create a biorepository of wheat fields. During World War I, he participated in the Great Lakes Research Project, and helped develop an experimental mill and a chemical fertilizer in Minnesota. From 1925, Woodhouse served as head of the Department of Botany at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he took over as chair from 1926 to 1938.  
   
   
 == Scientific achievements ==  
 During the first half of the 20th century, Woodhouse's work on phytotaxonomy laid the groundwork for a new approach for understanding phytotaxonomy in the western United States. Woodhouse was well known for his unorthodox approach to phytotaxonomy that involved asking the questions `` What is life? '' rather than `` What is happening? ''. He also pursued questions like : `` Is it related to the flowering times? '' and `` What is some characteristic morphological characteristic in fungi? '' After studying plants for decades, his work in the field of phytotaxonomy soon caught the attention of botanists around the world. He began publishing papers in an international scientific journal, American Journal of Botany, in 1920, and published a series of five papers, as well as a series of articles in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. He also published several papers on chemical plants. Many of his published works include the first description of Boulengeria mimosa. This moss, discovered in 1980, is often referred to as `` the coleopteran of the genus Woodhouse's plants. ''  
 Woodhouse was a pioneer of the field of flora ecology, along with Aron Feinberg, Henry Stockton-Blatt and Al C. Milliken, and is also credited with creating the microbial fungi taxonomy. He coined the term `` microbial floras '' in 1948, when he described the macroflora of various woody vascular plants as the coleopteran system and studied the malacological communities and feeding habits of the fungus.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 In 1924, he received the Charles Babbage Medal of the Royal Society of London.

Berthold Hatschek ( 3 April 1854 – 18 January 1941 ) was an Austrian zoologist remembered for embryological and morphological studies of invertebrates .   
 He studied zoology in Vienna under Carl Claus ( 1835-1899 ) , and in Leipzig with Rudolf Leuckart ( 1822-1898 ) . He gained his doctorate at the University of Leipzig with a dissertation titled Beiträge zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Lepidopteren . Hatschek was deeply influenced by the works of Ernst Haeckel ( 1834-1919 ) .   
 In 1885 he was appointed professor of zoology at Charles University in Prague , and from 1896 was a professor and director of the second zoological institute at the University of Vienna . Hatschek suffered from severe depression , which greatly affected his work in the latter stages of his life.Hatschek is remembered for the so-called `` trochophore theory '' , in which he explains the trochophore to be the larval form of a hypothetical organism- the `` trochozoon '' ( which in adult form corresponded to a trochophore-like rotifer , and was the suggested common ancestor of almost all bilateral , metazoan lifeforms ) .In 1888 he split Frey and Leuckart 's Coelenterata into three phyla : Spongiaria , Cnidaria and Ctenophora . From his research of amphioxus , the anatomical terms- `` Hatschek 's pit '' and `` Hatschek 's nephridium '' are derived .

Enrico Barone ( Italian : [ baˈroːne ] ; 22 December 1859 , Naples , Kingdom of the Two Sicilies – 14 May 1924 , Rome , Italy ) was a soldier , military historian , and an economist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Barone studied the classics and mathematics before becoming an army officer . He taught military history for eight years from 1894 at the Officers ' Training School . There he wrote a series of influential historical military works . In these he employed a method of successive approximations to which his study in economics had introduced him . In 1902 , he became head of the historical office of the General Staff . He resigned his commission in 1906 .   
 From 1894 he collaborated with Maffeo Pantaleoni and Vilfredo Pareto in the Giornale degli Economisti .   
    
    
 == Impact ==   
 He was the first to state conditions under which a competitive market would be Pareto efficient . He introduced variable factor proportions into neoclassical economics , contributing to the marginal-productivity theory of factor-income distribution . He extended conditions of general equilibrium in Walrasian theory , suggesting the feasibility of trial-and-error movement to market equilibrium . He pioneered the economic theory of index numbers . His contributions were made without use of utility or even indifference curves .   
    
 Barone has been described as a `` founder of the pure theory of a socialist economy . '' In 1908 , he presented a mathematical model for a socialist economy under which certain relations , later identified with shadow prices , must be satisfied for `` maximum collective welfare . '' The latter corresponds to least-cost-price of production from Pareto efficiency reached in competitive equilibrium . He stressed that such a result could not be arrived at a priori but only by experimentation on a large scale with great demands on data collection , even assuming unchanging productive conditions . In this , he suggested that movement toward economic efficiency in a socialist economy was not inconceivable , outlining two types of socialism : a centralized and decentralized model . For such regimes , whatever the distribution rule for output and income adopted by the Ministry of Production , the same economic categories would reappear for prices , salaries , interest , rent , profits , saving , etc. , though perhaps with different names . His analysis , and the Austrian Economists ' responses , fueled discussion of the economic calculation problem and market socialism in the 1930s . His method also anticipated Abram Bergson 's seminal formulation of a social welfare function three decades later .

 = Dirk-Jules Dermet =  
Dirk-Jules Dermet ( also Dirk Jules Dermett, 1888–1962 ) was a Belgian-Canadian mathematician, a prominent exponent of the Euclidean-Geometric theory, and the author of many algebraic and mathematical papers.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Dermet was born in Brefeld, where his father, Paul Dermet, was pastor. His parents wanted him to attend the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music, so he studied music theory and composition under Pierre Rolland, but he preferred to pursue mathematics. His professor, Vincenzo Valchek, helped recruit him as a mathematician and Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics. He earned his Ph.D. in 1913 from Johns Hopkins University, where he was a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences. While working at Johns Hopkins, he assisted Marcel Fougère with his work on quaternions, and worked with Alexander C. Maurer. He was also member of the APM Le Comptes Rendus Compositionse et Mathematique de France. He received the Gold Medal of the Mathematical Society of Edinburgh and the first membership in the Le Comptes Rendus Compositionse. He was appointed co-secretary for the Mathematical Institute of the Royal Norwegian Academy of Sciences in 1944, and his proposers were Dietrich Swank and Lise Skovgaard.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Dermet studied theorems of the norm and that are relativized to a variety of symmetric forms, and generalized principal and sum of ordinary differential equations on quaternions.He is sometimes cited as being the `` father of the Euclidean calculus '' ( a variation of algebraic geometry, where Euclidean geometry is a certain number of absolute terms, a starting point for all subsequent topics ).  
   
   
 === Euclidean geometry ===  
 Dermet formulated the principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives. According to Haack, Dermet was motivated by `` his desire to understand not only the fixed-point planes of a plane without surface or volume, but what is tangentially symmetric in a plane with both ''. His principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives allows for generalization of the differential equations of Maxwell's equations. According to D. G. Smith, the mathematical proofs of these equations allow for universal extension of all mathematical theory to a third dimension.  
 Dermet defined the `` Lassen '' triangle by extending the Euclidean rules to these three special case triangles. This triangle is the third most common triangle that contains a circle.  
   
   
 === First-order functional analysis ===  
 Dermet devised and extended earlier work on functional analysis, for which he is often called `` founder of functional analysis ''. It provides the foundation for the applicability of mathematical methods in functional analysis, a priority he dedicated to his collaborators Leon Balabanov and Silvio Nardi in 1931. Dermet established the basis for an understanding of the notion of linear algebra. Many mathematicians in his time believed that algebraic structure is linear if and only if the basic rules governing differential equations are observed. Dermet's work demonstrates that this is false. This work was widely known at the time and proved in several papers before Dermet's death in 1962.

 In 1907, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.

 = William Thurston Addison =  
William Thurston Addison ( 27 February 1828 – 5 February 1900 ) was an English Catholic priest, sociologist and writer, often credited with originating the concepts of `` modern woman '' and `` newly modern ''.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Addison was the son of Samuel Addison ( 1748–1834 ), a cloth manufacturer, and Elizabeth ( née Ashton ), daughter of the merchant Benjamin Ashton. In 1839, his elder brother was elected local vicar ; a year later, a brother-in-law became vicar ; in 1842, William moved to Naples, Italy, where he was vicar of Pavia from 1848 until 1856, when he was sent by the Curia to Rome. While there, Addison wrote his first books, which advocated conversion from Roman Catholicism to the Anglican communion ( now a separate religion ).  
   
 Addison's interest in reforming Catholicism was at the height of its renaissance in Italy in the early 1840s. His denunciation of Roman Catholicism as `` the filth and sloth of Rome '' caused the Bishop of Turin, Massimo Varese, to rebuke him, and Addison's plea for `` a definite and independent religious creed '' caused him to be included in the first of several Accademia dei Lincei revocati in 1844.In the following years he became an advocate of Anglicanism ; his assertion that his own views were socially liberal was ridiculed, and with the conversion of the wealthy Vezzano family, Addison became `` dean of the civic chapel in Turin, which, with its ecclesiastical privileges, makes him among the foremost authorities on modern Italian literature. ''  
 He was a fierce opponent of the order's separation from Rome, and his idea of `` radical independence '' ( also used in English with the title `` radical Protestantism '' ), due to his opposition to Rome's ecclesiastical structures and its tendency to centralize power, led many Roman Catholics to point to him as the prime supporter of their views. But it was not always so. He was a critic of his brother James Addison's Realism, also known as Non-religious Liberals, who held to what he called `` a quasi-devotional '' spiritual dimension.  
   
 He is sometimes referred to as the father of modern feminism, and is best known as the editor of Feminism and Modernity, and feminist religious figure Kate Millett, who wrote poetry from Addison's perspective. In contemporary English-language `` feminist writers '' he is sometimes called `` Addison-Gilmore '', and perhaps `` Gottlieb Johnson ''.

 = James Ramsay-Gibson-Maitland =   
Sir James Ramsay-Gibson-Maitland , 4th Baronet ( 29 March 1848 – 9 November 1897 ) was a Scottish aquaculturist who dedicated his life to experimenting on the practices of husbandry in fish . He gained recognition for his work by being awarded several diplomas .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 James Maitland was born on 29 March 1848 , his father was Sir Alexander Ramsay-Gibson-Maitland of Clifton Hall , and his mother was Thomasina Maitland ( née Hunt ) , and two brothers William and Keith . Sir Anthony was a descendant of the Earl of Lauderdale ; however , it was through his father 's marriage to Susan Ramsay that he inherited the Ramsay title and lands , as all other male descendants were deceased . Sir Anthony became the 3rd Baronet of Barnton , Sauchie and Bannockburn.James was educated at St Andrews University before leaving to attend the Royal Military College at Sandhurst ; however , after joining the army and becoming a Captain in the Highland Borderers , he left after one year . He married Fanny White , daughter of Sir Thomas Woollaston White , 2nd Baronet of Tuxford and Wallingwells in 1869 , near Nottingham , and they moved to Craigend in 1873 . James and Fanny had two daughters .   
    
    
 == Howietoun Fishery ==   
 Howietoun Fishery was established in 1873 , Maitland had previously been experimenting in another site ; however , the site was prone to flooding which meant that Maitland and a team of men had to try and recapture the escaped Swiss trout . Howietoun was an ideal spot as it had a water supply from Lake Coulter and a steady supply of spring water also.Maitland believed that fish could be raised in a similar way as farm animals , in that animal husbandry could also be successful when applied to a fishery . Maitland 's approach to experimentation was a scientific one ; he would only change one variable during an experiment and then would hypothesise how the outcome had happened . This meant that he was able to work out that breeding young stock of fish gave a result of weak offspring ; instead , he realised older stock must be used to gain strong offspring . He worked out that the female fish must be stripped of their eggs and male milt collected in October ; he then worked on hatching boxes for the live ova . After the fry hatched , then they were transferred to rearing boxes before being transferred to plank ponds . Maitland was meticulous in writing up his experiments ; this means that every change that he made in the diet , transport and selective breeding of the fish was documented . There are even pictures with measurements of the instruments Maitland was inventing to make rearing fish easier.Maitland also experimented on the diet of the trout and salmon at the fishery ; he worked out that horse spleen when ingested by trout caused blindness and nutritional cataracts . He worked on several options before concluding that the best option for feeding trout and salmon was horsemeat , shellfish and eggs.One of his most important experiments was finding ways to transport large quantities of live ova , at the time live ova were sent in crammed packages and when they arrived most did not survive , Maitland took three attempts to work out how to insulate the cargo to stop fluctuations in temperature . Successful shipments were then sent to Wellington , Dunedin and Otago in the specially designed shipment boxes that Maitland had designed himself .   
    
    
 === Awards ===   
 The work of Maitland at Howietoun fishery meant that he was awarded several diplomas in fish culture and two gold medals in 1883 and 1885 , at the International Fisheries Exhibitions , Edinburgh .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 Maitland died on 9 November 1897 , his daughter Mary Steel-Maitland and her husband Arthur Steel-Maitland took over the running of Howietoun . Howietoun Fishery was then amalgamated into the Northern Fisheries Company in 1914 before the Maitland family sold it in 1969 . It became a part of the University of Stirling Aquaculture Institute in 1979.The majority of brown trout re-stocking in Scotland is achieved through the stock of Howietoun Fishery .

 = Herbert Edgar Jordan =  
Herbert Edgar Jordan ( March 17, 1923 – December 23, 2004 ) was an American pastor, writer, and anthropologist. He was also the President of Emmanuel AME, a Congregational church in Houston.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Jordan was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. His father, a military commander, supported him throughout his youth.Jordan graduated from high school at a time when the politics and culture of the time shaped many young American men. The Vietnam War put an end to that formative experience and the racial tensions that it generated took priority over college. Jordan completed his undergraduate degree at University of Nebraska–Lincoln ( U. of L. ) in 1954, which he obtained with a B.A. degree in political science.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Jordan spent most of his professional life in the field of theology, arguing for biblical continuity, the emphasis of spiritual and historical theology on relational theology, and the family as a location of potential change, especially for marginalized and disenfranchised groups. He served as head of the Department of Religions, at the North Texas Community Church, as well as a pastor in a number of other Congregational churches. While at Emmanuel AME, Jordan chaired the book clubs and the mission committee for the church's 11th Harvest Moon's Conference in 1980, resulting in groups being created that invited readers to create their own kinds of homilies. These workshops were later published as `` Spiritual Philanthropy : Church Taxation and Contribution to Race, Sexuality, and Class Struggle ''.The most significant venture for which Jordan was known was the Rev. Michael Palmer-Jones's Challenge to Christology, which challenged traditional models of what can be and what can not be within scripture. For Jordan, Challenging Christology is a work of Christian witness, to reconcile his theological position with his experience as an African-American educator. As such, it can provide an introduction to and process for the emerging social theology of reconciliation and intercultural action.  
 Jordan served as the first African-American president of the World Council of Churches in the 1950s. He was a major figure in the African-American civil rights movement and served as a state representative. In addition, Jordan was a central figure in the failure to construct the Weather Underground and the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a founder of the Black Christian Leadership Council, and is known for his song, `` Write Your Whole Life '', and his evangelical study group formation programs.  
 In the 1990s Jordan published on his experiences in Memphis, Tennessee, at that city's Coleman Academy. In that study group, he emerged with a set of ideas for some of the church community's challenges and better conditions for ministry among a number of ethnic minorities in South Memphis. Over the next decade, Jordan wrote several books on the ways in which churches can change behavior and change programs in ways that impact the problems facing African-American communities. One such program is the Community Action Research Center ( CAMC ) in Marda, Mississippi, which Jordan helped found in 2002. This center brings together ministries, faith communities, civil rights organizations and black leaders in Memphis to analyze and synthesize information and action.  
 Jordan died of lung cancer in 2003 at the age of 79.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 Jordan received an Outstanding Teaching Award from South Central Methodist University ( 1979 ).  
 Jordan was honored by the Leadership Conference of Women Religious ( LCWR ) as the `` father of African-American church leadership ''.  
 Jordan was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the World Council of Churches ( WCC ) in 1995.  
 Jordan was named a recipient of the American Council on Church & State's `` Leadership in Community Service '' award.  
 Jordan was named the 14th and most senior African-American recipient of the ACOG Award for distinguished service by African Americans in Christian service, sponsored by the West-South Asia Center.

Howard Latimer Penman ( 1909-1984 ) was a British meteorologist . He formulated Penman ’ s Formula which is used worldwide by meteorologists and agricultural scientists to assess evaporation rates in different setups ( lakes and ponds , lawns , cropped fields ) and locations in the world . With John Monteith he formulated the Penman–Monteith equation which is used to calculate evapotranspiration and the need for crop irrigation . Penman was a distinguished Rothamsted Research scientist and government advisor , and a well-known local figure in Harpenden .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Howard Penman was born in County Durham and studied at Durham University where he graduated in Physics in 1930 . While working for the British Cotton Research Association in Manchester he worked on his thesis for his Ph.D. , which was awarded by Durham University in 1938 . Bored by the work on cotton dyes he applied in 1937 for a post in the Soil Physics Department at Rothamsted Research , headed by Bernard Keen , for a salary of £320 per annum . He became interested in the records of the drain gauges , and their relationship with rainfall , and from these was able to estimate the rate at which water evaporated from bare soil . From these beginnings some of his major contributions would follow . When war broke out he was recruited by the Admiralty and worked on the sound output of ships and submarines in connection with the development of acoustic mines . In 1944 he was recalled to Rothamsted to work on the physics of wet soil in preparation for the land campaign , where the progress of military vehicles would be vital .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After the war he continued work on water-related topics , including irrigation needs worldwide , and seasonal water balances for each catchment area in Britain . R.K. Schofield succeeded Bernard Keen in 1947 , but in 1954 Schofield became head of the Chemistry Department and Penman was appointed head of the separate Physics Department . Several members of his staff were involved in meteorological projects in Africa , and scientists came to be trained before taking posts in Nigeria , Kenya and Uganda and elsewhere , working on the needs of tropical crops . In 1961 he served as President of the Royal Meteorological Society , and he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1965 . He served on many academic and government bodies , and travelled widely , advising on reservoir projects and water needs , and was awarded the O.B.E . He retired from Rothamsted in 1974 , but continued to take an interest in scientific and international issues until his death in 1984 .   
    
    
 == Writings ==   
 Besides his work Penman also used to write humorous and satirical sketches . As a person he had a keen intellect and questioning temperament , but a fine sense of humour which showed itself in many ways , such as at the Christmas pantomimes at Rothamsted where he wrote some of the satirical sketches .

He was also concerned with the operation of the Murray Hill Computation Center and was actively engaged in the software design of Multics.After learning how to program the PDP-7 computer , Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , Joe Ossanna , and Rudd Canaday began to program the operating system that was designed earlier by Thompson ( Unics , later named Unix ) . After writing the file system and a set of basic utilities , and assembler , a core of the Unix operating system was established . Doug McIlroy later wrote , `` Ossanna , with the instincts of a motor pool sergeant , equipped our first lab and attracted the first outside users . `` When the team got a Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter for making camera-ready copy of professional articles for publication and patent applications , Ossanna wrote a version of nroff that would drive it . It was dubbed troff , for typesetter 'roff . So it was that in 1973 he authored the first version of troff for Unix entirely written in PDP-11 assembly language . However , two years later , Ossanna re-wrote the code in the C programming language . He had planned another rewrite which was supposed to improve its usability but this work was taken over by Brian Kernighan.Ossanna was a member of the Association for Computing Machinery , Sigma Xi , and Tau Beta Pi.He died as a consequence of heart disease .

Paul Rünemann ( 18 August 1893 – 30 November 1963 ) was an Austrian psychologist and an expert in mysticism.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Paul Rünemann was born in Landshut, but grew up in Vienna, and then in Berlin and Leipzig. After a high school education at the Reichenberg Gymnasium, he joined the University of Vienna. In 1919 he entered the rectorship of the St. Thomas More Abbey and was ordained in the name of St. Thomas himself. After this he worked as a teacher in the Reichenberg Rhenish Conservatory. In 1922 he moved to London, where he was hired by the London Society of Science and Art. After leaving the British Society for Psychical Research he worked as an editor of the Journal of Mind and Nervous Attraction. In 1929 he was named the Institute Professor of Psychology and Scientism at the University of Leipzig.  
   
   
 == Professional life ==  
 Rünemann spent many years as a teacher, journalist, and tutor in Vienna. He joined the editorial staff of the journal Optik und Psychik and is best known for his studies of the effect of the influence of extreme social pressure on the mind. In 1926 he published The Pure Mind : The Creative Eye of Heaven. This book was written from an extreme theoretical point of view. He advocated a mystical/empirical spirit as a distinctive faculty in the human mind. He believed the mental creations, and the consciousness or cosmic manifestation of the world, could be understood in terms of the unconscious mind, the esoteric emanations of the human soul, and the purely materialistic experience of the work of the spirit. Rünemann was a friend of Wilhelm Reich and wrote his story of Wilhelm Reich from Rünemann's point of view, which was used by Reich in his theosophical experiments and which resulted in Reich's death from a suicide attempt in 1936. In his essays in Psychology and Psychical Research he maintained that the major problem with current psychology was that it was not concerned enough with the cognitive element. This was felt to be out of step with the mystical aspects of nature, thus leading to a degradation of mysticism and pseudogamy. Rünemann strongly held that religious activity must be done according to the mystical rites of the times, and strongly opposed any attempt to substitute psychological science with that of material science.

Frederic van der Zuyten ( Dutch : [ ʀɑ̃tɑ̃dɐ ] ; 1831–1892 ) was a Dutch economist who is noted for introducing in 1850 the label Krampf keframofricus ( `` Keframorefo service '' ). The Krampf was the prototype of the `` hut hut '', a modern-day property in the Dutch housing market. The Krampf was in turn one of the two or three highest rated Dutch housing markets in the early 19th century. It is also noted as one of the main obstacles in achieving urban planning.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 van der Zuyten was born in Liège. Although he had considerable technical and personal experience in literature and education, in the long run, he did not stick to his profession for long, instead joining a private firm and becoming a partner of a landowner in Dijon, in the south of the country. After the fall of the Iron Crown, he moved to Brussels, where he resided for the rest of his life and was eventually one of the important persons who helped to break the wall between Brussels and the countryside. During that period he organized several hundred agricultural guilds in Belgium. In 1862 he died and was buried in the Dutch town of Leuven.

 = Udo Perl =  
Udo Perl ( 10 December 1875, Kiel – 24 September 1951, Frankfurt am Main ) was a German physicist and inventor. He made important contributions in the field of electrical engineering, optics, and magnetism. His invention of the valve valve, which eliminated the need for valves and other complicated mechanical operations in electricity production, led to the industrial application of mechanical valve operating systems.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Perl's mother died when he was three years old, after which his father returned to Germany and was sent to study at the University of Kiel. He studied engineering at the newly created Technische Hochschule in Hamburg, during which he designed an early motor vehicle, and then for the remainder of his academic career studied mechanical engineering at the University of Heidelberg. He returned to Kiel in 1911 to study engineering. After gaining his Ph.D. in 1920, he worked at the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft ( DPG ) in Berlin, becoming a Privatdozent in 1926. There he was part of an electronic experiment-group, where he formulated the principle of the perihelion flow ( which he independently demonstrated in 1916 ), which allowed the dynamic regulation of transformers to be used for control. From 1928 to 1932, Perl was also professor of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering at Kiel.  
 In 1925 Perl received his Ph.D. from Kiel, but was kept from it by prohibition legislation in Germany. Instead, he was placed in a Theresienstadt internment camp, for eight months during which he worked on digital circuits for Siemens in Leipzig. In 1928 he went to work at the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft ( DPG ) in Berlin as a Privatdozent, and remained there until 1949. There he was involved in research into transmission electron microscopes, infrared detection and control systems, and radar.  
   
   
 == Work in Germany ==  
 On 27 March 1939, at the opening of the Second World War, Perl was drafted into the Allied Armed Forces. He was interned in Sachsenhausen, Germany. On 8 May, the Nazis arrested him and stripped him of all his possessions, including his car, and sent him to a camp in Ravensbrück, where he remained for three months before being sent to the Nazi concentration camp of Jömno for six months. After being liberated by the Soviets on 5 June 1941, he then transferred to the Rhine-Eisenach Military Hospital where he was interned until the end of World War II.  
 Perl's nuclear research career took off from there. In the late 1950s he developed an early apparatus for magnetically levitating a tablet using spark flux, using an aluminium stick to force the structure to bend, the same kind of technique that had been used in experimenting with magnetism in diamonds.Later work on magnetrons started in Germany, by Wilhelm Hsieh. Perl played a key role in applying magnetrons to ferroelectric circuitry, but with a very small yield. Perl proposed a method that used large, silent, and static sparks to generate complex magnetic fields, such as magnetic fields around a solid source. He demonstrated this at a theoretical level in 1958 in the paper `` A prototype magnetic superhydrophobe '', which he presented at the European Physical Society meeting in Leipzig. He also worked on using magnetic fields to generate light with superconductors.  
   
   
 == Later life and legacy ==  
 Perl died on 24 September 1951, at the age of 75, in Frankfurt am Main.

 In 1825 , Kulik mentioned a table of factors up to 30 million , but this table does no longer seem to exist . It is also not clear if it had really been completed .   
 From about 1825 until 1863 Kulik produced a factor table of numbers up to 100330200 ( except for numbers divisible by 2 , 3 , or 5 ) . This table basically had the same format than the table to 30 million and it is therefore most likely that the work on the `` Magnus canon divisorum '' spanned from the mid-1820s to Kulik 's death , at which time the tables were still unfinished . These tables fill eight volumes totaling 4212 pages , and are kept in the archives of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna . Volume II of the 8-volume set has been lost .

 == Biography ==   
 Avigad studied architecture in what is now the town of Brno , Czech Republic . Avigad emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1926 . He married Shulamit ( née Levin ) Avigad in 1928 . He worked in the excavations of the Beth Alpha synagogue and the Hamat Gader synagogue .   
 Avigad earned his PhD in 1952 , with a dissertation on the tombs of the Kidron Valley , Jerusalem . He taught at Hebrew University from 1949 and until his retirement in 1974 .   
 He directed the dig at Beit She'arim beginning in 1953 . Avigad also worked on the excavations of Masada , the mountaintop complex built by Herod the Great . He was involved in the exploration of caves in the Judean desert , and published one of the Dead Sea scrolls.In 1969 , Avigad was invited to undertake the excavation of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem , devastated by the 1948 war and its aftermath . Among the finds were what was believed to be the earliest depiction of the menorah that once burned in the Second Temple , cut into a wall plastered 2,200 years ago , and the Burnt House , the remnant of a building destroyed when Titus , the future Roman Emperor , repressed the Great Jewish Revolt against Roman rule . This was the first physical or archaeological evidence for the destruction described in the work of Flavius Josephus . The dig also unearthed lavish villas belonging to the Herodian upper classes , remains of the Byzantine Nea ( new ) Church and Jerusalem 's Cardo , a fifth-century 70-foot ( 21 m ) -wide road connecting the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and Nea Church . Among the most exciting finds was the remnants of the Broad Wall twice mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah . Built to defend Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE , there remains an 80-foot ( 24 m ) stretch of wall , 23 feet ( 7.0 m ) thick , rising from bedrock west of the Temple Mount . Nearby , Avigad also unearthed the Israelite Tower , a remnant of Jerusalem 's Iron Age fortifications attesting to the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BCE.Avigad published on many topics , notably on Hebrew seals . One of the seals found by him in 1964 has been tentatively identified as belonging to Queen Jezebel , mentioned in the Bible : however , this identification is contested by others .   
 According to Bible scholar Frank Moore Cross , Avigad “ was Israel ’ s most distinguished epigraphist in his generation , and one of the great figures in the history of Hebrew and Jewish epigraphy . ”   
    
    
 == Awards ==   
 In 1954 , Avigad was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought .   
 In 1977 , he was awarded the Israel Prize , for Land of Israel studies .   
 In 1984 , he received the Yakir Yerushalayim ( Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem ) award from the city of Jerusalem .

 = William Morris Leiserson =   
William Morris Leiserson ( 1883–1957 ) was a notable labor relations scholar and mediator .   
 Leiserson , perhaps the twentieth century 's most influential labor mediator during the rise of labor unions and collective bargaining in the United States , was a professor , state and federal government administrator , mediator , arbitrator , and a member of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’ s `` brain trust '' which developed and wrote legislation such as the Railway Labor Act of 1934 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in 1883 , in Reval , Tsarist Russia ( in an area later to become the nation of Estonia ) , William Morris Leiserson came to the United States at the age of seven with his mother and two brothers . As a student at the University of Wisconsin , he studied under Professor John R. Commons , whose life and work inspired Leiserson to pursue the fields of economics and labor relations . After graduation , he continued at Columbia University where he earned his Ph.D. under Henry Rogers Seager in 1911 .   
 Leiserson then began a distinguished career as a research scholar , professor and public administrator that was marked by four decades of high level service in an era of profound economic , political and cultural change . Shortly after receiving his Ph.D. he returned to Wisconsin where he originated the State Employment Service . Returning to academia , he held professorships at the University of Toledo and Antioch College . His U.S. government service included Chief of the Labor Administration Division of the United States Department of Labor , Secretary of the National Labor Board of the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) and member of the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) . The NLRB was the administrative arm of the Wagner Act , seminal legislation that guaranteed the right of workers to bargain collectively .   
 Leiserson 's favorite government position was chairman of the National Mediation Board . This organization became the U.S. government 's administrative arm for implementing the Railway Labor Act , which Leiserson was instrumental in writing for the U.S. Congress . The Act later was amended to include the airline industry . This , also seminal , legislation provided thorough , and effective procedures ( carefully not requiring lawyers ) for solving labor-management disputes among transportation workers and industries providing essential services to the U.S. economy . To this day the legislation provides a prototype for resolving disputes that involve essential services .   
 Most of the foregoing positions were appointments by President Franklin D. Roosevelt , during the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II . After leaving government service , he retired and returned to research and teaching at Johns Hopkins University . Leiserson died in 1957 at the age of 74.While he devoted much scholarly and research effort to increasing the government 's awareness of the status and needs of the wage earner , Leiserson understood well the role of the mediator and the art of balancing the interests of labor and management in industrial disputes . Leiserson was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Oberlin College , June 24 , 1947 .

 = Samuel Kinsey =   
Samuel Kinsey ( 25 May 1832 – 8 June 1883 ) was a Christian minister and leader of the reactionary wing of the German Baptist Brethren that became the Old German Baptist Brethren .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Samuel Kinsey was born in Covington , Ohio on 25 May 1832 to Joel Kinsey and Elizabeth Brumbaugh . On 23 April 1852 , he married Barbara Nead , daughter of Peter Nead , and together they had thirteen children . He joined the Brethren as a member in 1853 . Kinsey was economically successful , and was at various times a carpenter , a farmer , proprietor of a general store , owner of a tree nursery , and publisher . The place where he lived became known as the town of Kinsey Station . He was a deacon and was elected in 1870 as a recognized minister of Lower Stillwater Brethren congregation in Randolph Township near Dayton , Ohio .   
    
    
 == Old Order leadership ==   
 Between 1851 and 1865 , Brethren periodicals began to be published under progressive editors Henry Kurtz , James Quinter , and Henry Holsinger . At the same time , Kinsey 's father-in-law , Peter Nead , was the primary leader for the reactionary wing of the Brethren , known as Old Order Brethren . Out of this group emerged a new periodical , The Vindicator , with Kinsey as editor . It was first published on 1 March 1870 as an eight-page monthly , composed of scriptural interpretations , exhortations to piety , and news on church affairs . One of its goals was to counter the influence of progressive Brethren periodicals.A major controversy among the Brethren arose over the authority of tradition and the role of the church in establishing a church order or ordnung , known as the `` order of the Brethren '' . In The Vindicator , Kinsey rejected that the church had any authority to change or adapt the order . This view sharply contrasted with other Brethren at the time . The group that became the Church of the Brethren revered tradition and supported the role of the church in discerning an ordnung , but held this order to be changeable . Meanwhile , the faction that became the Brethren Church rejected the need for a unified church order or agreement on practices not explicitly defined in Christian scripture and sought to eliminate some Brethren traditions which they felt lacked support from the scriptures.In around 1874 , Kinsey handed over control of his business interests to others in order to devote himself to the service of the church . He was a hymn writer . In 1878 , Kinsey was one of four men appointed and financially supported by the Southern Ohio District of the Brethren to engage in missionary work in Kentucky . This work was largely unsuccessful.A significant part of Kinsey 's ministry was also his ongoing publishing . The Vindicator was expanded to 32 pages per issue . His work was not well received ; Kinsey was reprimanded by the 1881 Brethren Annual Conference for encouraging dissension and criticizing church authorities . The Old German Baptist Brethren split at this conference , with Nead and Kinsey as their primary leaders . The proliferation of unauthorized and uncontrolled periodicals has been claimed as a major cause of the division . In 1882 , at their first meeting , the Old German Baptist Brethren recognized The Vindicator as their official publication . Kinsey was also ordained as an elder in 1882 .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 Kinsey died on 8 June 1883 . He was succeeded as editor by Joseph I . Cover . The Vindicator set a precedent of conservative periodicals that was followed by Mennonite George R. Brunk 's Sword and Trumpet . Kinsey has continued to be influential in the Old German Baptist Brethren . The Vindicator continues to be published for the Old German Baptist Brethren as of 2008 .

Heinrich Heinrich Groene Hesse ( 7 October 1849 – 6 January 1936 ) was a German linguist and educator who helped develop German-language education and reform education. He also established the then-new school of phonetics in Berlin.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Hesse was born in Aix, in Mecklenburg–Schwerin, into a Jewish family. He studied the language and took up specialised learning in Pashto and Armenian. In 1865 he was elected member of the University of Berlin, and from 1868 to 1870 he taught for one year at the Free University of Berlin.  
 In 1871 he accepted the position of Privatdozent in Berlin, and later became a Privatdozent for the University of Leipzig and of the University of Göttingen. In 1884 he became Privatdozent in Freiburg and from that year to 1891 director of the Deutsche Grammatik der Nachrichten-Lexikon und Zahlrhein.At Freiburg, Hesse became expert on the Acayenne and Paimatik dialects. He also developed a lexicon of Afrikaans, a language classification system.Hesse held a Chair in the Education of the People in the Russian Empire and taught for many years at the Higher Higher Institute of the Higher German State.  
   
   
 == Notable achievements ==  
 Groene Hesse's work has been widely respected in German-speaking East and West, and in a number of international languages. His central contribution was to establish a school for phonetics in Berlin, the first such school in the world.  
 From 1876 to 1882, Groene Hesse, both as a linguist and educator, established the Deutsche Grammatik der Nachrichten-Lexikon und Zahlrhein in Freiburg. Groene Hesse also directed the language program in a number of German universities, and had various students accept advanced degrees in the schools of the New Testament. The `` Bibliothek Gebiete und Grammatik der Nachrichten-Lexikon und Zahlrhein '' ('Bibliothématique and Grammar School') at Freiburg is regarded as an exemplary and high-quality unit, closely paralleling some of the American schools.

He was first employed upon the State works of Pennsylvania , and his earliest independent work was in 1835–37 as chief of the survey for the Hartford and New Haven Railroad ; he was subsequently employed either as chief or consulting engineer upon every railroad running out of New Haven ( excepting possibly the Derby road ) . In like manner he was employed on the northern lines running up the Connecticut River valley and through Vermont , on the Lake Shore road between Buffalo and Erie , and on other roads in Ohio , Illinois , and Michigan .   
 From 1839 to 1848 he filled the chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Middlebury College , Vt. ; this position he resigned to give himself more fully to his engineering labors . He removed from Middlebury to New Haven in 1852 , and resided there for the rest of his life . From 1856 until his death he was a deacon in the First Church , in which his father had filled the same office . For several years after his return to New Haven his labor was mainly given to the development of his invention for the artificial production of ice economically on a large scale . The principle of his invention was widely adopted , but he failed to secure pecuniary recompense for it . He made valuable original investigations in astronomy , mathematics and physics , and was equally interested in questions of theology and political science , both in their theoretical and practical aspects In connection with the remarkable meteor shower of November 1833 , he deserves the credit for first suggesting the correct theory of radiation of meteor tracks from a fixed point among the stars .   
 Early in October 1884 , he was attacked with congestion of the brain , and died at his home in New Haven on November 22 , at the age of 83 .   
 On March 2 , 1829 , Twining married Harriet Amelia Kinsley , of West Point , N. Y. , who died October 12 , 1871 . Their children were three sons ( graduates of Yale ) and four daughters , including the Rev . Kingsley Twining ; they survived their parents , with the exception of one son who died in the American Civil War .

 = Georg Fischer =  
Georg Fischer ( 30 August 1884 in Kirchhöhle, Baden-Württemberg – 10 August 1941 in Kiel ) was a German mathematician, mathematician known for his work on cohomology and that of Ellsberg.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Georg Fischer studied at the University of Kiel with Bertrand Russell and had a successful career in Berlin as a graduate student in 1903. After the outbreak of World War I he returned to Berlin and joined the math department, teaching until 1935. Fischer's interest in social problems led him to form what is now known as the social problem group, an academic scientific community made up of mathematicians interested in the `` social and political situation of the middle classes in Germany and in the state of society at large. '' In 1929 he became vice-president of the German Academy of Science.  
 During the Second World War he served in various positions in the Wehrmacht and was a member of the Baader Judenrat ( National Security Council ). In the 1950s and 1960s, Fischer was editor of the main journal Annalen der mathematischen Wissenschaften, but in 1965 he retired.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 During World War I he published books on the mathematics of probability and applied mathematics. Fischer's work, along with Fergus Henderson and Georg von Inzeti ( 1879–1934 ), made important contributions to the field of differential geometry, especially the foundations of the abelian groups. It dealt with problems related to error in the theory of numbers, the potentiality axioms of the theory of processes and binomial differential equations.  
 Some of the later books that dealt with real number theory, and particularly problems of distributivity, were :

Angelo Ruffini ( Pretare of Arquata del Tronto , 1864–1929 ) was an Italian histologist and embryologist .   
 He studied medicine at the University of Bologna , where beginning in 1894 he taught classes in histology . In 1903 he attained the chair of embryology at the University of Siena .   
 He was the first to describe small encapsulated nerve endings ( mechanoreceptors ) which were to become known as Ruffini corpuscles . He used a gold chloride stain on his microscope slides in order for to view the tiny corpuscles.Ruffini was a pioneer in the study of amphibian gastrulation , providing a comprehensive and detailed description on the formation of `` bottle cells '' . He published these findings in a book titled Fisiogenia ( 1925 ) .   
    
    
 == Relationship with Sir Charles Sherrington ==   
 Between 1896 and 1903 , Ruffini corresponded regularly with Sir Charles Sherrington . This relationship evolved after Ruffini sent copies of his papers on muscle nerve endings to Sherrington . Ruffini also sent Sherrington eleven slides of 'Organi nervosi ' ( available online ) and Sherrington was instrumental in getting Ruffini 's work published in the Journal of Physiology .

 = Konrad Koch =   
Wilhelm Carl Johann Conrad Koch , commonly known as Konrad Koch ( 13 February 1846 – 13 April 1911 ) was a German teacher and football pioneer .   
    
    
 == Early life and career ==   
 Koch was born on 13 February 1846 in Braunschweig , Duchy of Brunswick . After finishing secondary school in Braunschweig , he studied theology and philology at the universities of Göttingen , Berlin , and Leipzig.He returned to Braunschweig in 1868 to become a teacher for Ancient Greek , Latin , history , and geography at the prestigious Martino-Katharineum secondary school .   
    
    
 == Football ==   
    
 Koch was a pioneer in introducing ball games as part of physical education in German schools . He was influenced by the ideas of Thomas Arnold respectively Thomas Hughes ' novel Tom Brown 's School Days . In 1874 Koch and his colleague August Hermann organized what is believed to be the first-ever football match in Germany , between pupils from their school Martino-Katharineum . However , according to other sources , earlier games of football might have taken place in other German cities , possibly between members of the Dresden English Football Club.In 1875 , Koch published the first German version of the rules of football , although Koch 's version of the game still closely resembled rugby football . The new game was quickly adopted by other schools in Braunschweig and spread to other cities during the late 1870s , including Hanover , Bremen , Hamburg , and Göttingen.In 1876 , a newspaper in Hamburg wrote that Koch had learned about football during a trip to England . This is likely false , as there are no sources that indicate that he had visited England before 1895 . Koch did speak English , however , as he had been taught from a young age by his father , an English teacher .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Koch was a close friend of novelist Wilhelm Raabe , and like Raabe , C.F . Theodore Steinway and Heinrich Büssing , among others , a member of the social club Die ehrlichen Kleiderseller zu Braunschweig .

Franz Xaver Hauser ( 12 January 1794 in Krasowitz , today Krasovice , part of Kondrac , ( Benešov District ) , Czech Republic – 14 August 1870 in Freiburg im Breisgau ) was a singer , voice teacher , and music manuscript collector .   
 At his father 's insistence , he first studied medicine , but he then studied singing with Johann Wenzel Tomaschek and composition with oboist Josef Triebensee .   
 He made his stage debut in 1817 in Prague as Sarastro in Mozart 's Magic Flute . He found great success at the opera theaters in Vienna , Leipzig , and Berlin . He retired from the stage in 1838 and taught singing in Vienna . In 1846 he was appointed as director of the newly established conservatory in Munich ( now the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München ) , serving as its director until 1864 . He retired in 1865 to Karlsruhe and two years later to Freiburg im Breisgau .   
 Contemporary critics considered Hauser cold as an actor but approved of his pure voice . He was known for his interpretation of Weber and as Figaro ( both Rossini 's and Mozart 's ) , Bertram , William Tell , and Spohr 's Faust .   
 Hauser had many students including Jenny Lind and Henriette Sontag . He wrote a popular singing manual , Gesanglehre für Lehrer und Lernende ( Leipzig , 1866 ) ( freely available through Google books ) . As a composer , he was known for his songs . His correspondence with composer Moritz Hauptmann was published in two volumes in 1871 .   
 Hauser 's greatest significance today is as a collector of musical manuscripts –most notably of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach- assembling the greatest 19th century collection of that composer 's manuscripts . He was a consultant for the Bach-Gesellschaft edition and prepared a thematic catalogue of Bach 's works . Most of Hauser 's Bach manuscripts ( including 19 cantatas , the accompanied sonatas for violin , and the English suites for keyboard ) were acquired by the Berlin Royal Library in 1904 . Others were destroyed in 1945 . Parts of his collection are also in the Darmstadt Landesbibliothek and the Harvard University Loeb Music Library .   
 His son , Moritz Hauser ( 1827–1857 ) , became a theater director in Königsberg and a minor composer .

Reinhold Mannheim ( 11 December 1892, Berlin – 2 November 1947, Heidelberg ) was a German ornithologist, amateur flier, and binomial-name inventor. He was a member of the Schwabian-Hertz family.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Reinhold Mannheim was born in Berlin in 1892. He began his early ornithological studies in Gießen, where his father owned a shop. After graduating in 1900 he worked in a leather factory. After leaving the factory in 1904, he did his zoological research, briefly doing field work in Germany. In 1906 he moved to Heidelberg as an assistant to the zoologist and collector Carl Schultze. This position allowed him to tour Europe, South America, Australia and New Zealand.  
 In 1919 he was appointed head of the ornithological section at the Landsdämmerungs-Gesellschaft ( Landmarks Scientific Office ), a post he held for 20 years. During this period, he also made numerous scientific discoveries, and started the bird collection in Heidelberg. In 1921 he collected more than 400 new birds and collected close to 1,000 g. Mannheim believed that ornithological knowledge could be promoted through service, with the collector being held in high regard. However, because there were very few male collectors in the United States, the former Mayor of Heidelberg, Adolf Wilke, called Mannheim's efforts `` a real mother's milk ''.After four years, the work was abandoned because there was not enough of a demand for ornithological specimens. He retired from this job in 1925 and he became a teacher, self-employed and at the same time a keen amateur ornithologist. He died in Heidelberg.

 In 1797 he had succeeded to the rectory of Parn. In 1801 he resigned his rectory, moved to the Austrian-Hungarian territory and established the University of Halle, which was, however, broken up in 1809. From 1805 to 1810 he was Professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Vienna, and from 1812 to 1822 Professor of Comparative Religion and Philosophy at the University of Leipzig. From 1812 to 1820 he was in Baden.

 = Giovanni Battista Brocchi =   
Giovanni Battista ( or Giambattista ) Brocchi ( 18 February 1772 – 25 September 1826 ) was an Italian naturalist , mineralogist and geologist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was born in Bassano del Grappa , Italy , and studied jurisprudence at the University of Padova , but his attention was turned to mineralogy and botany . In 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in the new lyceum of Brescia ; but he more especially devoted himself to geological researches in the adjacent districts . The fruits of these labors appeared in different publications , particularly in his Trattato mineralogico e chimico sulle miniere di ferro del dipartimento del Mella ( 1808 ) a treatise on the iron mines of the Mella traditional region . These researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in the recently established kingdom of Italy , and enabled him to extend his investigations over a great part of the country.In 1811 Brocchi produced a valuable essay entitled Memoria mineralogica sulla Valle di Fassa in Tirolo ; but his most important work is the Conchiologia fossile subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli Apennini , e sul suolo adiacente ( 2 vols. , Milan , 1814 ) , containing accurate details of the structure of the Apennine range , and an account of the fossils of the Italian Tertiary strata compared with existing species . These subjects were further illustrated by his geognostic map , and his Catalogo ragionato di una raccolta di rocce , disposto con ordine geografico , per servire alla geognosia dell ' Italia ( Milan , 1817 ) . His work Dello stato fisico del suolo di Rome ( 1820 ) , with its accompanying map , is likewise noteworthy . In it he corrected the erroneous views of Scipione Breislak , who conceived that Rome occupies the site of a volcano , to which he ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills . Brocchi pointed out that these materials were derived either from Monte Albano , an extinct volcano , twelve miles from the city , or from the Monti Cimini , still farther to the   
 north.In 1814 Brocchi presented the thesis that species , like individuals , age and eventually die out , - an idea that later influenced Charles Darwin.Several papers by him , on mineralogical subjects , appeared in the Biblioteca Italiana from 1816 to 1823 . In the latter year , Brocchi sailed for Egypt , in order to explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources . Every facility was granted by Mehemet Ali , who in 1825 appointed him one of a commission to examine the territory of the recently conquered Kingdom of Sennar ; but Brocchi , unfortunately for science , fell a victim to the climate , and died at Khartoum.Much of his writings and collections are now housed in the Museo Civico di Bassano .

He returned to Norway after only two years , and resumed his Hebrew teaching . In 1889 , he took his dr. phil . degree with the thesis Det saakaldte Perfektum og Imperfektum i Hebraisk ( `` The So-called Perfect and Preterite in Hebrew '' ) .In recognizing the Hittite language as Indo-European on the basis of two letters found in Egypt ( Die zwei Arzawa-Briefe , 1902 ) , he played an important role in the deciphering of the Hittite language script . In two landmark volumes ( 1907 and 1915 ) he published the Amarna letters , diplomatic correspondence of the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV , better known as Akhenaten ( 1351–1334 BCE ) .

Pavel Makarovich Prokofiev ( Russian : Скач Алекса́ндр Со́чевич Комо́нов ; 15 April 1904 – 24 December 1982 ) was a Soviet author, zoologist and entomologist who worked extensively in Belarus. He is considered to be one of the most important of the twentieth-century Russian naturalists, and is one of the principal figures of the `` Belarusian Wrecking Crew '' who targeted the oilfield on the Lake Baikal in 1988.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Pavel Makarovich Prokofiev was born on 15 April 1904 in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine, the second son of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's brother Alexander Solzhenitsyn ( 1900–1951 ) and Mary Daniilovich ( née Wilson ). His mother was a nurse, whose family migrated to the village of Poltava from Russia in the 1830s. On 13 April 1925, Makarovich was born. Makarovich's older brother, Alexander, who was studying sciences, played as a guitarist in a band. He received musical lessons from the grandparents, before being educated at the local gymnasium ( Rakhamaretsi [ Dance Festival ] ) where he was taught music by Russian organist Vadim Kopetsky.  
 Makarovich entered the Ukrainian Paleontological Academy in Vilnez ( Pechnovsk ) in 1928, where his intellectual interest developed, having studied with his family.  
 In 1931, while still a student in Ukraine, Makarovich returned to Ukraine to work in the Paleontological Academy as a mineralogist. Makarovich won the Kyiv Philological Prize in 1932. By the end of the Second World War, Makarovich had returned to Poltava and married Susy ( 1909–1992 ), a teacher. Makarovich died on 24 December 1982.  
   
   
 == Quotations ==  
 `` Pumlin stars are fossilized mollusks with a liver in every one of them. They are considered unique as they can survive and grow in water where others have died.  
 `` `` In an interesting display of his scientific creativity, Dr. Makarovich also showed off the extreme individualism and freedom he enjoyed in his life.... Just when we thought he could remain a morose scientist in the milieu of rampant totalitarianism and the Great Purge, he turned from statistics and time constraints to large scale speculation on a broad variety of topics. These included the hitherto unreported development of the Pumlin-like organism from the Balakiella on Lake Baikal and its possible links with the molluscs and gastropods that inhabited the deposits. The books of the Ukrainian scientists that had disappeared in 1942 became the subject of very early 'new research on the geological histories of the Tatar republics. This was accompanied by a move from primitive mud crabs to hitherto undiscovered species of fish, e.g. the Bafalikid amphibians. Moreover the development of the scientific and technological world of air conditioning changed the lives of many in the Soviet Union. ''

Arthur C. Miller ( September 6, 1911 – November 15, 1984 ) was a Canadian physicist who was widely considered a pioneer of the study of condensed matter physics. Miller is best known for his discovery of a basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium, which he named in his honor, although Miller was also a notable theoretical physicist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Miller attended the University of Toronto with Lloyd Boron, and later earned a B.A. degree in physics with a minor in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1941.  
 In 1942, Miller received a F.R.S. degree in physics from the University of British Columbia, as well as a Fellowship of the Toronto Academy. In 1953, he was awarded an M.S. degree from the University of Minnesota, and in 1955 received a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. In 1958, he returned to the University of Toronto, where he was a member of the B.S. Department, a laboratory assistant, and an instructor in physics. From 1959 to 1965, Miller was a professor of physics, co-chair of the physics department, and an assistant to the chancellor, Harold M. Schonberg, whose efforts resulted in the establishment of the Department of Physics. Miller returned to his position at the University of Toronto in 1971 as Professor of Physics, as the department grew. He was also on the editorial boards of Physics Today, the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada, and the Canadian Journal of Physics. In 1973, he was elected to the Royal Society of Canada.  
 In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he investigated the properties of hydromelites and gaseous ices by experiments in liquid helium. Miller published many papers on theoretical physics and topics in condensed matter physics, including the theory of the condensation of liquid helium, the infrared spectroscopy of helium, the crystallographic properties of plasmas, and the theory of shock-absorption at atomic resolution.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1943, Miller obtained his first research results on compressible gases by studying the interactions of droplets of helium between two metals, among them chloride and zinc. At that time, the ices of water were highly compressible, although in 1912 Miller discovered a superfluidity limit of about one. Miller's work on this limit and other phenomena became known as Miller's law. Miller named his discovery of the limit as a collaboration with Hans Bethe, who became Miller's colleague at the university. In 1946, he became assistant professor of the department of physics at the University of Toronto, but went on to become professor emeritus in 1976. Miller authored an elementary textbook on condensed matter physics.  
   
   
 == Other notable accomplishments ==  
 Miller is perhaps best known for his 1943 discovery of the basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium. That law states that a liquid will not condense as it becomes denser and colder, a characteristic known as the Miller's law of elasticity. Miller obtained this result by observing the interaction of the air and the liquid helium. He came to believe that this boundary must be large enough for the maximum dissipation of heat, which he called the Miller's law. In that 1970s paper, he considered an `` experimental remedy '' for the thermal convection and conduction of liquid helium : Compressible metals will compress as they get colder, thus stopping the flow of convection. To obtain this result, Miller used X-ray diffraction to isolate the metal-helium boundary in helium.

 == Early life and career ==   
 Gaffky 's parents were the shipping agent Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Gaffky , and Emma Schumacher . His medical studies at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin were completed in 1873 after an interruption by the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 . His dissertation postulated a relationship between lead poisoning and kidney disease . He worked as an assistant at the Berlin Charité hospital and passed the state medical exams in 1875 . He then worked as an army surgeon .   
 Gaffky worked as an assistant to Robert Koch in Berlin . Under Koch 's leadership , Gaffky and others developed bacteriological protocols and achieved progress in identifying causes of infectious diseases .   
    
    
 == Principal discoveries ==   
 Following Karl Joseph Eberth 's description of a bacillus suspected as the cause of typhus , and Koch 's independent work on the same organism , Gaffky dedicated years to improving culture methods to isolate the bacillus . He was able to produce cultures in gelatin and other hosts .   
 In 1884 , Gaffky published results reporting that he had isolated the eberthella or Gaffky-Eberth bacillus in 26 of 28 cases of typhoid.Gaffky was later part of an expedition to Egypt in which Koch identified transmission methods of cholera . He became a government advisor during the 1892 cholera outbreak in Hamburg . He led an investigation of the 1897 outbreak of bubonic plague in India .   
 Gaffky served as director of the Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases from 1904–1913 .

 = Sverre Petterssen =   
Sverre Petterssen ( 19 February 1898 – 31 December 1974 ) was a Norwegian meteorologist , prominent in the field of weather analysis and forecasting .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Born in Norway into a humble family , he paid for his higher education by working at the telegraph office , and a nursery provided by the armed forces that he joined as a recruit . He studied in Bergen where he met Tor Bergeron during a lecture , and was so impressed by his analysis of a 1922 storm that he joined the Bergen School of Meteorology in 1923 .   
 In the late 1920s he worked at the Geophysical Institute in Tromsø , northern Norway .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After school , he remained a weather officer in the Norwegian Air Force until 1939 . He went to the US in 1935 , lecturing on Norwegian meteorological theories to the US Navy and Caltech . In 1939 , he was hired by MIT as head of the meteorology department , and wrote two important books there : Weather analysis and forecasting ( 1940 ) and Introduction to Meteorology ( 1941 ) .   
 With the invasion of Norway , Petterssen returned to Europe and offered his services in England to the Met Office , on loan from the Norwegian Air Force . During World War II , he served as a weather forecaster for bombing raids and special operations .   
 He is most remembered for his work in what has been called the most significant weather forecast in history , the D-Day Forecast , where he contributed significantly to the postponement of D-day by one day . Three groups of meteorologists gave advice to General Dwight Eisenhower , and D-Day was originally planned for 5 June 1944 . But he got big trouble with academically untrained competitors , especially from the United States , who believed that the weather was repeated – and had found a weather recurring pattern in the 20s that they felt was positive . And General Dwight D. Eisenhower was relying on his men .   
 `` Pettersen , which was not always as diplomatic , made it clear that this was nonsense and quasi science but Eisenhower was convinced , and the invasion would take place on 5 June . But at the morning meeting on 4 June Pettersen presented a weather map showing a storm on 5 June . To strong protests from the American quasi-meteorologist , D-Day was postponed.The German war fleet was laid in Port : They thought it could not get any invasion because of the storm .   
 But the Norwegian meteorologist knew his meteorology : His analysis showed a 36-hour gap between two storms the morning of 6 June – just enough to make the giant attack with more than 100,000 soldiers , planes , paratroopers and boats . `` The forecast provided by Sverre Petterssen caused Eisenhower to decide at 0430 on 4 June to postpone D-day to 6 June . Initially it was proposed to postpone the operation to 19 June .   
    
 On 19 June the worst storm to date in the century struck the English channel . If D-Day had been launched on 5 June as originally planned , the Allied casualties would probably have been much higher , and even higher if launched on 19 June .   
    
    
 == Aftermath ==   
 In retrospect , Americans claimed – including in movies – it was their meteorologists heroes who saved the situation , and only in 1974 , shortly before his death , Sverre Pettersen came with his version – documenting a violent quarrel .   
 The American Meteorological historian James Fleming also honored Pettersen in a report 30 years later – in 2004 .

 == Life ==   
 Broucke was born on a farm in Furnes , Belgium . He studied at the Catholic University of Leuven , earning bachelor 's and master 's degrees in mathematics in 1955 and 1957 respectively , under the mentorship of Georges Lemaître . After completing his military service he worked for the oil industry while earning a second master 's degree , in operations research , from the University of Brussels in 1960.He returned to Leuven for his doctoral work , on the three-body problem , which he completed in 1962 . At this time he moved to California to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ; while there , he also took adjunct positions at West Coast University , the University of Southern California , and the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . His position at UCLA became a regular-rank associate professorship in 1969.In 1975 , Broucke moved to the University of Texas at Austin as an associate professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics . At Austin , he helped found the Texas Institute for Computational Mechanics in 1976 .   
    
    
 == Contributions ==   
 In the three-body problem , Broucke 's doctoral research involved pioneering use of computer simulations to classify stable and unstable orbits . He investigated what happens to this classification for earth–moon–satellite systems in the limit as the ratio of earth to moon mass approaches zero ; his conjecture about this limiting behavior , `` Broucke 's principle '' , was finally proven correct in 1981 by Lawrence Perko . As part of this work , he also developed symbolic computation methods for handling Poisson series.Later , he studied the anisotropic Kepler problem , a mathematical model of the motion of an electron trapped in a potential well . As he showed , this system is not purely chaotic : it has periodic orbits as well . He also studied the use of gravity assist in finding efficient flight plans for space probes .

 = Wilhelm Mayer (composer) =   
Wilhelm Mayer ( 10 June 1831 – 22 January 1898 ) was an Austro-Bohemian composer who published his works under the name W. A. Rémy . He was also a noted teacher , whose pupils included Ferruccio Busoni and Felix Weingartner . His name sometimes appears as Wilhelm Mayer-Rémy .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Wilhelm Mayer ( some sources say his full name was Benjamin Wilhelm Mayer ) was born in Prague , the son of a lawyer . He studied at the Prague Organ School in 1846 . His overture to Eugène Sue 's drama Jean Cavalier was written when he was 17 , but his parents required him to enter the legal profession . He graduated as a doctor of law in 1856 , when he was 25 . He then occupied various posts in the Austro-Hungarian civil service.In 1862 he took up music once again , becoming conductor of the Steiermärkischer Musikverein in Graz . During his eight-year stay in that post , he introduced a number of his own compositions , such as the overture Sardanapalus , the symphonic poem Helena , and a Symphony in F major . These three works were also presented in Leipzig.After resigning as conductor in 1870 , he devoted himself to composition and private teaching . He published his works under the name W. A. Rémy , an anagram of `` W. Mayer '' . It has also been noted that the initials W. A. of his pseudonym are the same as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's , Mozart being his musical idol . Mayer focussed on the music of Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach , but greatly disliked Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner . For him , the first four preludes and fugues from Book I of Bach 's The Well-Tempered Clavier represented water , fire , earth and air respectively , and he conceived many others in a poetical light . He taught Luigi Cherubini 's methods for counterpoint , and used Hector Berlioz 's orchestral treatise.Through his former pupil Wilhelm Kienzl 's intercession with Ferruccio Busoni 's father , Busoni studied harmony , counterpoint , orchestration and composition with Mayer from November 1879 to April 1881 , being just 15 when he completed his formal studies with honours . Mayer taught Busoni that `` the widest possible culture makes the artist '' , a motto Busoni wrote on his 430-page treatise on composition he had written out in longhand during his studies with Mayer and later transmitted to his own pupils . Busoni wrote a `` Fugue in F major on a theme of W. A. Rémy '' ( BV 154 ) , and dedicated his Praeludium ( Basso ostinato ) und Fuge ( Doppelfuge zum Choral ) Op . 7 ( Op . 76 ) , for organ ( BV 157 ) to his teacher .   
 Mayer 's other notable students included Felix Weingartner , Richard Heuberger , Emil von Reznicek , Richard Sahla , Marie Baumayer Josef Gauby and Friedrich von Hausegger.As a teacher , Mayer was exacting , but also inspiring . His reputation extended throughout Europe . Emperor Franz Josef I awarded him the Knight 's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph , the only private music teacher ever so honoured.Mayer married and had a daughter , Melanie . He died in Graz in 1898 , aged 66 . His former student Ferruccio Busoni wrote a tribute to him in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung .

Charles Latif Hyder ( April 18 , 1930 – June 8 , 2004 ) , known in the USSR as `` Dr Haider , '' was an American astrophysicist and dissident from Albuquerque , New Mexico .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Hyder was born in Albuquerque , New Mexico in 1930 . After graduating from Albuquerque High School , he served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.Hyder attended the University of New Mexico , graduating with bachelor 's ( 1958 ) and master 's ( 1960 ) degrees in physics . In 1964 , he received a doctorate in astrophysics from the University of Colorado . Through the 1970s and 1980s , he was involved in various scientific activities in the field of solar physics , publishing more than 50 works , and was also involved in NASA 's Solar Maximum Mission satellite .   
 Hyder was married twice and had four children .   
    
    
 == Activism ==   
 Hyder was most noted for his strong anti-nuclear stance , as well as for hunger strikes which he used to advocate his causes . He began a supposed 218-day hunger strike on September 23 , 1986 near the White House in Washington , demanding that Ronald Reagan stop the arms race and eliminate the use of nuclear weapons.In the Soviet Union , Hyder was a regular participant on the broadcast program Vremya ( 'Time ' ) . A commemorative medal was minted in his honor . Mikhail Gorbachev wrote a letter to him , and when the hunger strike ended , Soviet punk rock band Nol ( 'Zero ' ) composed a satirical song entitled `` Доктор Хайдер '' ( `` Dr. Haider '' ) , with its refrain meaning `` Dr. Haider has started to eat again ! ''   
    
    
 == Controversy ==   
 In the USA , Hyder 's hunger strike did not attract much attention . Furthermore , the astrophysicist was not always present at the White House . The Russian Gosteleradio ( government broadcasting ) correspondent in Washington , Vladimir Dunaev , introduced and explained the scientist 's story to the Russian audience . Dunaev 's son later revealed that to make the hunger strike look continuous , Dunaev would shoot five stories in succession every day , asking Dr. Hyder to change into different suits and ties .   
 According to Dunaev , Hyder was advised by doctors to diet , as his weight openly threatened his health . During the hunger strike he lost almost half of his weight of 300 pounds . It was later revealed that Hyder drank fruit juice and took vitamins during the hunger strike . According to the most skeptical physicians , he fasted only in the daytime .   
 After the end of the hunger strike , Hyder ran for president . He also subsequently accused the USSR of environmental pollution , after which Russian news agencies stopped reporting about him in the USSR . In 1999 , he published the book `` Human Survival on a Plutonium-Contaminated Planet , '' again trying to fast in order to fight against the storage of nuclear waste ( Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ) .

 Pantevski's first publication, `` Theory of methods of partial differential equations and partial differential equations with maxima '' ( 1976 ), is based on his model of the cosmological constant constant. He expanded his theoretical works in 1990–1991 on Fourier series ( and later on three-dimensional analysis of intervals ) and the cosmological constant. In 1997 he wrote `` Subtransitions on Fourier series, differential geometry, and intensional form '' ( translated into English ).Pantevski founded and headed the Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis, which under his leadership developed the Heidelberg ’ s theoretical foundations of functional analysis in three major directions. The first, intensive theoretical studies of the theory of partial differential equations and the theory of functional integrals, was completed in the 1990s and was launched in 2004 with Luigi Traciari and Arshad Shalabi. The second, more extensive work, was carried out in the 2000s by collaborators and students, with results published in 2 special volumes : the first volume explored the components of Laplace's continuum, the second authored by Alexander Sitsay, for which an abstract was published in 2012. From 2007 to 2015, Pantevski served as the director of the Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis ( 中国科学科書科功能力, Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis ), established in 2017. It is the ninth Centre of Excellence for Functional Analysis in the world. From 2009 to 2015, Pantevski also served as the director of the Moscow Institute of Mathematical and Theoretical Sciences ( 中国宁国部科学科書科功能力, Moscow Institute for Mathematical and Theoretical Sciences ).He also published over a hundred scientific papers in journals such as Annals of the American Mathematical Society ( 1975–2008 ), Annals of the European Academy of Sciences ( 1982 ), the Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the Journal of Mathematical Statistics and Complex Analysis ( 2004–2005 ).

William Henry Dallinger FRS ( 5 July 1839 – 7 November 1909 ) was a British minister in the Wesleyan Methodist Church . He was also an accomplished scientist , being the first to study the complete lifecycle of unicellular organisms under the microscope and studying the adaptation of such organisms to temperature.He made numerous contributions to microscopy , and was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1889 to 1892 . Dallinger was awarded three honorary doctorates , the Ll.D . from Victoria College , Toronto in 1884 , the D.Sc . from Dublin in 1892 , and the D.L.C . from Durham in 1896 .   
 Dallinger was married to Emma Ion Goldsmith ( 1842-1910 ) . They had one child , son Percy Gough ( 1867-1930 ) .   
    
    
 == Research into Darwin 's theories ==   
 Dallinger was one of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment . In the late 19th century , he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years ( 1880–1886 ) . Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °F up to 158 °F . The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °F , and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °F . The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment , on the other hand , were perfectly fine at 158 °F . However , these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °F . Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator , and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment . Unfortunately , Dallinger 's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886 , and Dallinger could not continue this line of research .   
 Dallinger was an early supporter of Darwinism . He accepted natural selection and considered creationism to be `` absolutely untenable '' . He believed there was no conflict between religion and science and there was no reason to try and reconcile the Book of Genesis with geology .

David Randall-MacIver FBA ( 31 October 1873 – 30 April 1945 ) was a British-born archaeologist , who later became an American citizen . He is most famous for his excavations at Great Zimbabwe which provided the first solid evidence that the site was built by Shona peoples .   
 Randall-MacIver was educated at The Queens College , Oxford . He graduated in 1896 with a first class degree . He began his professional archaeological career in 1898 working for Flinders Petrie in Egypt , uncovering the mortuary temple of Senwosret III at Abydos . In 1906 he was appointed as Curator of the Egyptian Section at the Penn Museum , University of Pennsylvania , taking charge of the collection following Sara Yorke Stevenson 's resignation in 1905.With funding from Eckley B. Coxe Jr. , Randall-MacIver initiated research into the relationship between Egypt and Nubia , uncovering some of the earliest evidence of ancient Nubian culture , dating back to 3100BCE . Between 1905 and 1906 Randall-MacIver conducted the first detailed study of Great Zimbabwe . The absence of any artefacts of non-African origin led him to conclude that the structure was built by local people . Earlier scholars had speculated that the structure had been built by Arab or Phoenician traders . Between 1907 and 1910 he excavated the site of Karanog , a former provincial capital of the Kingdom of Kush .   
 Randall-MacIver left Penn museum in 1911 following a disagreement with new Museum Director George Byron Gordon , becoming librarian of the American Geographical Society . In 1914 he left the AGS to work as a British intelligence officer in the First World War . In 1921 he moved to Italy to study Etruscan archaeology . He remained in Italy during World War II , assisting the Allied forces Monuments , Fine Arts , and Archives program , the famous `` Monuments Men '' , to preserve historical monuments and cultural property.Randall-MacIver died in New York City on 30 April 1945 .

 = Galileo Ferraris =   
Galileo Ferraris ( 31 October 1847 – 7 February 1897 ) was an Italian physicist and electrical engineer , one of the pioneers of AC power system and an inventor of the three-phase induction motor . Many newspapers touted that his work on the induction motor and power transmission systems were some of the greatest inventions of all ages . He published an extensive and complete monograph on the experimental results obtained with open-circuit transformers of the type designed by the power engineers Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born at Livorno Vercellese ( Kingdom of Sardinia ) , Ferraris gained a master 's degree in engineering and became an assistant of technical physics near the Regal Italian Industrial Museum . Ferraris independently researched the rotary magnetic field in 1885 . Ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors . The research and his studies resulted in the development of an alternator , which may be thought of as an alternating-current motor operating in reverse , so as to convert mechanical ( rotating ) power into electric power ( as alternating current ) .   
 On 11 March 1888 , Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin ( two months later Nikola Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 , application filed October 12 , 1887 . Serial Number 252,132 ) . These alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts , and depended on rotating magnetic field for their operation . The resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance . The invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification , as is the power transformer . These inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances . Polyphase power enabled the use of water-power ( via hydroelectric generating plants in large dams ) in remote places , thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity , which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done . This versatility sparked the growth of power-transmission network grids on continents around the globe .   
 In 1889 , Ferraris worked at the Italian Industrial Institution , a school of electrical engineering ( the first school of this kind in Italy , subsequently incorporated in the Politecnico di Torino ) . In 1896 , Ferraris joined the Italian Electrotechnical Association and became the first national president of the organization .   
 Galileo Ferraris did not confine his research interests to electricity . He also researched the fundamental properties of dioptric instruments and made elementary representation of the theory and its applications . His work contains a detailed description of the geometric dioptrics for uncentered systems . He provided a greater generality as previously found in the telescopic system treatments , with less emphasis on applications .   
 In the second main sections , the results obtained are applied to optical instruments . The magnification , field of view , and the brightness of the instrument were dealt with in great detail . The field denned as the author of the cone opening angle , the tip of the first main points of the lens , and its base formed by the parts of the object in view , will possess the same brightness . The eye is not treated .   
    
    
 == Memorials ==   
 The city of Turin honored the contributions that Ferraris made to science . A general committee proposed an addition to the Royal Industrial Museum of Turin with a permanent monument commemorating his scientific and industrial achievements . Additionally , an avenue was named in honor of Ferraris .

 = Leonard Dubkin =   
Leonard Dubkin ( 1905-1972 ) was an American author and naturalist from Chicago .   
 He is known for his books and newspaper columns on the subject of wildlife found in urban locations .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Leonard Dubkin was born in 1905 in Odessa , Ukraine ( then Russia . ) He came to the United States with his parents in 1907 . The oldest of seven with a chronically ill father , his family relied on Jewish charity organizations . In the eighth grade , Leonard dropped out of school to work and take care of his family . By the age of 12 he was taking meticulous notes on the life histories of butterflies and moths . He took an interest in nature from an early age and frequently contributed to the children 's pages of the Chicago Tribune . The social worker Jane Addams took an interest in him and gave him his first typewriter . This paved his way to a career in journalism.In 1934 he married actress Muriel Schwartz and created a local talent directory for radio and stage actors . This successful business allowed him to write his novels , review books for the New York Times , and correspond with other nature writers such as Rachel Carson and Edwin Way Teale .   
 Often featured in his books and columns is his daughter Pauline Yearwood , herself a successful journalist and the managing editor for the Chicago Jewish News .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Dubkin had difficulty committing to the topics assigned by editors in favor of observing nature . En route to cover a plane crash at Midway Airport , he stopped to observe a cricket singing in a field . By the time he got to the scene of the accident , all the survivors had been taken away . He missed another story by exploring a church tower where pigeons went to nest or die . On a pivotal case in which he was sent to interview a murder suspect , he became distracted by squirrels nesting in the walls of the suspect 's home . Upon returning to the office without a scoop , he was fired .   
 In the following period of unemployment and occasional dispiriting office jobs , he took to observing nature closely instead of looking for work . Among the creatures he observed in Chicago were ballooning spiders , bats , crickets , Polyphemus Moths and Cecropia moths.He eventually found work as an amateur naturalist , writing about his subject in a newspaper column with Lerner Newspapers and in his own books .   
 He authored six books , now out of print , about the natural history of Chicago , arguing for the preservation of secret places , small parks , and urban wildlife . He wrote a column called `` The Birds and Bees '' in the Lerner Newspapers , published between 1950 and 1972 . During this time there was little to no nature writing taking place in Chicago - conservation efforts focused on larger suburban spaces , such as forest preserves .   
 He became a champion of everyday wildlife and promoted the idea that wildlife worth observing was not necessarily exotic.A city park in Chicago is named for him , Dubkin Park , where he often ate lunch while working for the Lerner Newspapers . The park has a community garden , many species of native and non-native plants , and a blank wall along the Metra tracks . Before she died in 2016 , his daughter planted a peony in his memory at the park . It is still there .

 = Luis Garcia Bernal =  
Luis García Bernal ( born May 13, 1938 in Muñoz, Piedras Valley, Spain – September 9, 2006 in San Luis Obispo, California ) was a Colombian-born Canadian researcher who was a pioneer of the field of neuropsychology. He was first recruited by Clark G. Goodstein at the Toronto Military College and then later transferred to the Laval University in Montreal.  
 Between 1973 and 1978, Bernal was a senior fellow in Canada at the Laval University, specializing in the human brain. In his personal literature, Bernal quotes Henry Hill ( who would later become a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto ). Hill later wrote that Bernal, `` the overwhelming leader of neuroscience, deserves credit for turning the “ arms of psychology to a serious problem in Latin America ” ''.  
 Bernal is best known for his research on hallucinatory phenomena in visual cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders. His work with H.M. Senn ( associate professor of psychology at Dalhousie University ) is especially cited in a 2008 book titled “ The Brain and the Soul : Personalized Neurology for Neuroscientists and Patients ”. It consists of numerous presentations of neurophysiological images and experiments that demonstrate a brain involvement in pathological conditions. In his writings and interviews, he acknowledges that `` misdiagnoses may be more prevalent than the general population realizes, '' and that these abnormalities are `` actually relatively rare, and in the context of normal cognitive processes will probably not cause functional problems. ''  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born in Muñoz, Spain, the son of Carlos and Bessida Bernal. He received his undergraduate degree at Laval University and PhD at the University of Cambridge, where he met his wife Ann A. ( amanda ) Lindholm. Together they had two daughters, Ann Yochi ( 1988 ) and Olivia Christina ( 1996 ).  
 He first met and befriended L. J. Bernal, a graduate student at the University of Toronto ( in the 1940s ) who was deeply fascinated by neuroscience at the time, but subsequently left Canada after seeing Yochi and Olivia in medical school. Bernal helped them gain their master's and doctoral degrees.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1952, Bernal moved to Canada, first to Guelph and then to the University of Toronto. He and Linda Lortieri ( of La Trobe University ) established the Center for Neuropsychology at the University of Toronto. He was asked by University of Toronto President Dick Mellencamp to design the undergraduate program, and this started a long collaboration with other graduate students and faculty.  
 He was the author of 13 books ( along with Lortieri ) on neuroscience and had a lengthy correspondence with anthropologist Frances Woolf. He also edited and collaborated with Yochi. He studied neurological disorders in infants with Louise Bird at the University of Toronto Medical College.The definitive biography of L. J. Bernal, The Quantum Brain, was published by Gallica Press in 1983. He died of an overdose of opiates in September 2006 in San Luis Obispo, California. His daughter ( Olivia Christina Bernal ) and granddaughter ( Lauren P. Bernal ) are Canadian. His only daughter, Anna ( Ruth Paul ) also worked as an ethnographer.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 At the time of his death, Bernal was living at 208 Davison Drive in Santa Monica, Los Angeles County. He died due to a heart attack while jogging to the library.

Henri Christophe Daniel ( 22 December 1873 in Ouest-et-Loire – 1 October 1944 in Paris ) was a French physicist who was a collaborator with Henri Becquerel in the later development of special relativity and general relativity.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Henri Daniel was born in Ouest-et-Loire, to a French industrialist of Jewish descent. He was the only child of businessman and artillery officer Louis Daniel and Marguerite Gabrielle Daniel. In 1877, the family moved to Paris, where Daniel attended the Ecole Normale Supérieure where he played football. In 1881, he enrolled in the École des Hautes Études of Paris and afterwards graduated from the Cours de France with a first class in 1887.  
 In 1886, Daniel undertook a mechanical research trip to the United States, which had been sponsored by Otto Hahn ( father of the famous philosopher, Otto Hahn ). On the voyage, Daniel developed a galvanometer, which he used to measure elastic flow in motor and fluid-junction circuits,. He later travelled to Australia and New Zealand on a Royal Commission and published his results on the properties of electric circuits. His research on the properties of electric circuits earned him the title of a Corresponding Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
 Daniel received the Prix Saint-Simon, the James Huxley Prize ( 1930 ) and the Padua Prize ( 1948 ) from the Royal Society of Canada.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 In 1891, Daniel was elected a corresponding member of the Académie des sciences, the Académie des hautes études, the Société international de combinatorie appliquée et de des marcuses. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Daniel is credited with the discovery of the Daniel effect, one of the fundamental variables in general relativity. Daniel was also the first to derive the index for maximum constants for all celestial bodies from Maxwell's equations.  
 On 1 October 1944, Daniel died of diabetes, and is buried in the tomb of his father in the cemetery of Ouest-et-Loire.

 = Anton Churinsky =  
Anton Churinsky ( Russian : Андреевич Николаевич Левов ) ( 27 January 1875 – 14 December 1953 ) was a Soviet logician and philosopher.  
 Churinsky was born in Saint Petersburg and studied mathematics, philosophy, logic, and mathematics at the Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1913 to 1920, he worked at the Institute of Philosophy in Saint Petersburg. In 1923 he became a professor at the Kharkov State University.Churinsky made contributions to theoretical logic, analysis, complex analysis, and mathematical logic. The following is an example :  
 Churinsky and other logicians called for the admission of types of rational numbers into analytic mathematics. Specifically, they regarded them to have generalizations in the following way : The higher rational numbers have in general a unit of place in space. The units of place of these rational numbers, now called quotients, can thus be analyzed with the method of differential equations of general linear variables. In that way, they had proved the universal extension of the equation of linear variables in general.By making an application of the theorem `` If a normal polynomial has two rational numbers { 2, 1,...,... }, then there is a unit of place in space containing a polynomial whose units of place are both 2 and 1 '', Churinsky formulated the singular integral method of a rational number.

George Herbert Lindsay ( c. 1868 – February 11, 1974 ) was a naturalist, educator and amateur hiker.  
 Born in the Easton, Pennsylvania area, he emigrated to California in 1863 and settled in Malibu, California. He became a naturalist in the Catskill Mountains of New York in 1871. Lindsay collected and documented numerous species including mantis shrimp, toad shrimp, wall lizard, rattlesnake, California silky snake and numerous other reptiles, birds, amphibians and insects. He trained at the Elks Lodge.  
 He became an Academy Award-winning actor, producer and author. He spent several years writing a series of travel books and articles for the Shoshone Journal. He also wrote the article for a British newspaper about the California gold rush, who recognized that Lindsay could help them get their story out. In 1903 he married Victoria Smedley Van Vechten who also worked as a naturalist. Their daughter, Mary Ann ( who would become a popular nature writer ), would become an American writer.He taught school for a short time and also taught the dog-walkers at Malibu Lodge.

 = Thomas Garrett =  
Thomas Garrett FRSE FLS ( 30 April 1812 – 22 February 1880 ) was a British geologist and petrologist. He wrote many scientific papers on alpine ores and minerals, and wrote for a period of time as a mineralogist. He spent much of his life at The Great Seat, Edinburgh, becoming one of the most important exponents of the fossil record.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Garrett was born on 30 April 1812 in Islington, London. He was educated at Hulme Grammar School, and Haverford College, Oxford, where he achieved an A-grade in his final examination in natural philosophy. He began studying geology at the University of Edinburgh, gaining a B.A. in 1838, followed by a B.D. in 1841.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was a Professor of Geology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England from 1847 to 1849, and was a member of the Geological and Mining Society of London for five years ( 1848–60 ). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852, and wrote 1853 and 1854 monographs on the subject of Geology. He was the first geologist to suggest that continental drift had led to the appearance of fossils in North America, which suggested the presence of multi-plate magmas. He did a preliminary analysis of evidence for the Holocene, and later published his conclusions in the 1854 book Fossil Lands, and some of the in-depth conclusions of Fossil Geology in the Philosophical Magazine, discussing the impact of a wetter climate on fossils. In 1856, he revised and updated the classic Geology textbook by Thomas F. Jessop, and also helped to refine the detailed geological descriptions of caves, huts and war graves in the Spitsbergen and Ardennes regions.  
 He lectured widely in Europe and North America on his discoveries, especially the Alcyone Goldfields, and also gave talks on the history of the Carboniferous mountains in Europe. In 1857, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, receiving his doctorate in the same year. He returned to England to take up the chair of Geology at the University of Edinburgh, succeeding Sir Thomas Busby, in 1867, having been made FRS in 1845, and became Professor of Geology in 1870, and Curator of the Geological Museum and Geological Collection in 1875.  
 The Geological Survey of Scotland, which he had founded in 1846, became one of the major interests of the South-East Scottish Association, led by Alexander Campbell, in the mid-1850s. In the later part of the nineteenth century, he devoted himself to the study of Gold and silver in Scotland, particularly the Canary Islands and the islands of Antigua, French Guiana, Curaçao, Guyana, the Maldives and the Andaman Islands.  
 He died on 22 February 1880, at his house in the Villambourg Estate in Queen's Lynn, Gloucestershire.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 During Garrett's lifetime and especially after his death, many theories about the history of the world were popularly put forward, but a comprehensive list is omitted from the authors'obituary. These include :  
   
 The age of the Earth was estimated to be over 300 million years.  
 There are solid sources of trace fossils, and geological times are not normally thought to be much greater than the Age of the Earth.  
 The fossil record of the earth is found in many regions throughout the world, yet in many places it is incomplete or unreliable.  
 The world today is overpopulated with minerals, and yet there is a lack of suitable sites for these minerals.  
 The fossils are in Africa, Southeast Asia, Asia Minor, America, Canada and Australia, and the Palearctic.Garrett, like many leading British geologists and mineralogists of his generation, believed the gold of the Australian and African coastlines may be trace fossils.

 = Andr C3 A9 Garrigue =  
André Garrigue ( 18 December 1848 in Nice – 16 January 1923 in Nice ) was a French composer, conductor and music educator. He is remembered for his compositions as Orpheus, Goetia and Hyperion.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Garrigue was born in Nice and studied at the Paris Conservatoire under René Lalande. At the age of 22, he became an assistant to René Lalande. He was promoted to permanent professor in 1864 at the age of 27. In the beginning of the 1870s, his name became associated with the Gregorian chant style. Garrigue published his first opera Orpheus ( 1872 ) and his second ballet Hyperion ( 1873 ). Together with Jean Lille, Garrigue was the first to write the incidental music for ballet Pyromante. His most significant work is the choral work Orpheus ( `` The Nightingale '' ), and his other choral works include the cantatas Glyphis and Ionichae. Among his major works are cantatas Les Gards de lyre, Guarner ( `` Lords of the Light '' ), and Les Destinees ( `` The Dome '' ). He died at the age of seventy-two. His cantatas, Les dernières colors pour Sainte Marion, Aristides et Ida, ou Elegies du Carnaval, were particularly important in the introduction of the French opera genre to Germany and Italy.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 He composed many sacred works, which include orations for mass and for church. He also composed shorter songs for church and children's choir. His cantatas are based on the legend of Orpheus. The cantatas were generally written in a style of full length improvisation. They include scherzo cantatas, two dramatic cantatas and a overture. All of the musical works are variations of Lacertes'Mestre Mure, or the sea song Orpheus. The overture `` Hyperion '' is perhaps the most famous of his overtures, being often sung at the end of St Mark's Day parades, but the overture contains several elements which have become familiar : a mixture of folk and Christian elements, later transformed by an overture written in 1967 by another composer, Beethoven.

Günter Margarethe Malus ( 11 July 1857 – 22 April 1948 ) was a German Catholic priest, musician and composer.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Malus was born in Gotha, the son of a ship captain. He studied theology at the University of Kiel in Germany. His first composition was entitled Schöner Waldunter ( Spring urn ). Malus also taught himself piano. Malus married a niece of his, but he had to leave her for another woman in 1885.  
 Malus's early work on the piano is influenced by late romantic music by Johannes Brahms, but his interest in music at a young age was not at the level of Liszt. He dedicated many of his later works to the Saints and the Fathers.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Malus taught piano for many years in Wittenberg and in Berlin. In 1897 he won a doctoral degree in theology at the University of Heidelberg under Carl Goering. His doctoral thesis dealt with the miracles and the journeys of St. Jerome. He wrote several symphonies, and also four revivals and six new movements.  
 From 1901 he was chaplain to the Prince Consort Joseph of Saxe-Kassel, succeeding Professor Rudolf Klima. He taught music at the Karlsruhe Cathedral School of Music. In 1908, after Malus's retirement from the University of Kiel, he entered a religious order.  
 From 1909 to 1924 he worked at the `` der Fliegerbuch ''. From 1924 to 1952 he worked for the American Catholic Choral Association and wrote and performed in concert concerts.  
 In 1921, Malus composed his `` Faust Reiner '', a compact musical that had to be performed on a Hochschule für Feststag in Leipzig. In the work, which represents the return of German myth and literature in 1851, he writes,  
   
 My lover is eternal, my God, the one who girds us both, who rules the sky, who drowns all the energies of the earth in his waters, my God ; my love is for and for ever...  
 In August 1928 he married Pauline Katzen.  
 In 1954, Malus died of pleurisy in the midst of a series of recitals.

P. K. Merety ( 1888-1959 ) was a theoretical physicist who studied cosmic rays.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In his early career, K.M. Merety studied the radio waves produced by the CERN-scale accelerator, Radioactivity in the Hydrogen Dome ( the first time a working interferometer was used on such a large scale ). During the summer vacations of 1908, he made arrangements to use a portable Zeppelin to carry out research near Naples. He also returned to work as a spectrometer, experimenter, and radio relay operator, and with the University of Naples in 1910. With his father-in-law, he studied spectroscopy with Friedrich Nernst, with the assistance of E. Newton, and physics with C. T. Mehlbeck and A. Kastner. In 1911 he became an associate professor, and in 1913 an assistant professor of physics and an assistant professor of theoretical physics. From 1918 to 1930 he was an assistant professor, and in 1933 became full professor. He held these positions until 1944. He co-founded the Ritter Institut für Naturwissenschaften und Physik, and served on its editorial board until 1947. From 1939 to 1946, he was the director of the Research Institute of Nuclear Research.  
 In 1929 he demonstrated that a nucleon in a strongly ionized vacuum exists as a positron, the proton, which he identified as two protons linked by an elementary transition in his model. This was a paradigm of his later work on charged particles and the high-energy X-rays. In 1940, he demonstrated the existence of an electron gap between two positively charged electron-positron pairs. In 1949 he carried out an experiment to determine the mass of the electron-positron pair corresponding to the proton-electron transition, which he called the positron-electron transition. By combining the features of both approaches, he developed a method for studying the mass of positron-electron pairs, which became known as the Merety-Einstein transition ratio. In 1954 he discovered an electron gap between an electron and a muon, known as the Merety-Dworkin transition. These two transitions subsequently gave rise to the positron-gamma and the positron-ion transitions.From 1947 to 1961 he was director of the Max Planck Institute for Theoretical Physics in Würzburg, and from 1947 to 1965 he was the first director of the Technische Hochschule der Wissenschaften. He died in Würzburg.

Kan worked together with Spencer Kimball on the program called `` gnubile '' licensed under the GNU General Public License . Kan graduated from the University of California , Berkeley in 1997 with a major in electrical engineering and computer science , and was a member of the student club the eXperimental Computing Facility ( XCF ) .   
 In June 2000 , when Kan was 24 , he formed a distributed search engine known as InfraSearch.com with Steve Waterhouse and another friend . Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen was an investor in the start-up . InfraSearch was purchased by Sun Microsystems on March 6 , 2001 for $ 12.5M USD in Sun stock options . The acquisition became part of the JXTA project at Sun . Kan joined Sun as an employee , and continued to work with the technology .   
 Kan was relatively well known in internet circles for a testimony he gave in July 2000 at the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on `` Intellectual Property in the Digital Age '' . Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich , Sony CEO Fred Ehrlich , and others also gave testimony at the hearing . In his account , as the United States Senate decides the fate of companies like Napster , he stressed that `` technology moves forward and leaves the stragglers behind , '' and that `` the adopters always win , and the stalwarts always lose '' . Kan was advocate of peer-to-peer ( P2P ) computing and some credit him , along with other Gnutella pioneers , as its originator . He argued that it is part of an emergent technological area called distributive computing.On June 29 , 2002 , he committed suicide . The cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head . Kan was 25 years old . Prior to taking his life , Kan updated an electronic copy of his resume hosted on a University of California , Berkeley server to read `` Summary : Sad example of a human being .

 = Charles Auguste de B C3 A9riot =   
Charles Auguste de Bériot ( 20 February 1802 – 8 June 1870 ) was a Belgian violinist and composer .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in Leuven , where there is now a street named in his honor , he moved to France in 1810 , where he studied violin with Jean-François Tiby , a pupil of Giovanni Battista Viotti . He was later encouraged by Viotti himself and briefly worked with Pierre Baillot but did not embrace all their teachings and was also influenced by Paganini . He served as chamber violinist to King Charles X of France and to King William I of the Netherlands and toured with great success to London , Paris and the great music centres of Europe . In addition to playing the violin , he was a virtuosic pianist who toured through much of China despite the emperor 's objections .   
 Bériot lived with the opera singer Maria Malibran and had a child ( Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , a piano professor who taught Maurice Ravel , Ricardo Viñes , Enrique Granados and others ) with her in 1833 . They were married in 1836 when Malibran obtained an annulment of her previous marriage . Felix Mendelssohn wrote an aria accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple . However , Malibran died the same year from injuries sustained in a fall from a horse .   
 After Malibran 's death , de Bériot lived in Brussels and did not return to performance until 1838 . In 1840 in Vienna he married Marie Huber , daughter of a local magistrate.In 1842 , Pierre Baillot died in Paris at the age of 71 , and his position as instructor at the Paris Conservatoire was offered to de Bériot . He rejected the offer , however , and in 1843 became chief violin instructor at the Brussels Conservatory where he established the Franco-Belgian school of violin playing . On account of failing eyesight he retired in 1852 , and in 1858 became totally blind .   
 Paralysis of the left arm ended his career in 1866 . Surgeons amputated his left arm to relieve pain . Among his students were Hubert Léonard , Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst .   
    
    
 == Compositions ==   
 De Bériot composed a great amount of violin music including ten concertos . Although these are now rarely heard , his pedagogical compositions are still of use for violin students .   
 De Bériot 's pioneering violin technique and Romantic style of composition make his concertos and etudes an important stepping stone for the serious violin student wishing to gain a firm foundation before studying the major concertos of the Romantic era . His most popular concertos are No . 9 in A minor Op . 104 and No . 7 in G major Op . 76 .   
 Itzhak Perlman released a recording of Scene de Ballet , Op . 100 on his album , `` Concertos from My Childhood '' . This recording features the Juilliard Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster . Barbara Barber also released a recordings and sheet music with piano accompaniment of the first movement of de Beriot 's Concerto No . 9 in A minor Op . 104 and Scene de Ballet , Op . 100 with her series , `` Solos for Young Violinists '' .   
 Schirmer publishes his Violin Method Op . 102 and His `` First 30 Concert Studies '' Op . 123 . Peters publishes the famous encore piece for violin and orchestra ( in a reduced format for violin and piano ) `` Scene de Ballet '' Op.100 .

 = Gaja Alaga =   
Gaja Alaga ( 3 July 1924 in Lemeš – 7 September 1988 in Zagreb ) was a Croatian theoretical physicist who specialised in nuclear physics .   
 He was born in noble family of Bunjevac Croats in the village of Lemeš ( today called Svetozar Miletić ) in northwestern Bačka in Kingdom of SHS ( today in autonomous province Vojvodina , Serbia ) .   
 He was a corresponding member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1968 and a professor at the University of Zagreb Faculty of Science ( Croatian : Prirodoslovno-matematički fakultet ) . He worked in the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb ( the capital city of Croatia ) , the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen , the University of California , Berkeley , and Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich .   
 In 1955 , cooperating with Kurt Alder and Ben Roy Mottelson , Alaga discovered the K-selection rules and intensity rules for beta and gamma transitions in deformed atom nuclei . This discovery was key to the development of new nuclei models which confirmed that subatomic particles can distort the shape of the nucleus . This is in accordance with the model for collective motion ( based on nuclei deformed from a spherical shape , but with axial symmetry ) for which Aage Bohr , Ben Roy Mottelson and James Rainwater won the 1975 Nobel Prize .   
 Also in 1955 ( the journal Physical Review ) and in 1957 ( the journal `` Nuclear Physics '' ) he discovered asymptotic selection rules for beta and gamma transitions between states of deformed nuclei . The so-called Alaga rules are in common use among specialists in nuclear structure , in comparing theoretical transition rates with measurements.He was the editor of the scientific magazine Fizika from 1978 until his death in 1988.He died in Zagreb in 1988 . Today , a street in the Trnje city district of Zagreb bears his name .

 = Emil Zuckerkandl =   
The organ of Zuckerkandl is a chromaffin body derived from neural crest located at the bifurcation of the aorta or at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery . It can be the source of a paraganglioma.The term para-aortic body is also sometimes used to describe it , as it usually arises near the abdominal aorta , but this term can be the source of confusion , because the term `` corpora paraaortica '' is also used to describe the aortic body , which arises near the thoracic aorta . This diffuse group of neuroendocrine sympathetic fibres was first described by Emil Zuckerkandl , a professor of anatomy at the University of Vienna , in 1901.Some sources equate the `` aortic bodies '' and `` paraaortic bodies '' , while other sources explicitly distinguish between the two . When a distinction is made , the `` aortic bodies '' are chemoreceptors which regulate circulation , while the `` paraaortic bodies '' are the chromaffin cells which manufacture catecholamines .   
    
    
 == Structure ==   
    
    
 == Function ==   
 Its physiological role is thought to be of greatest importance during the early gestational period as a homeostatic regulator of blood pressure , secreting catecholamines into the fetal circulation .   
 The organ itself regresses in the late third trimester and following birth to form the aorticosympathetic group of the adult paraganglia .   
    
    
 == Clinical significance ==   
    
    
 === Pathology ===   
 It can be the source of paraganglioma.The organ of Zuckerkandl is of pathological significance in the adult as a common extra-adrenal site of pheochromocytoma though the most common extra-adrenal site is in the superior para-aortic region between the diaphragm and lower renal poles.Extra-adrenal tumors account for around 10 % of all cases of pheochromocytoma . Resection has been described.In addition to its endocrine effects , it can also cause obstructive pathology .

Heinrich Wilhelm Giesche ( German pronunciation : [ ˈʃɛ̯vɛk ˈleinuːtɛtɛ ] ; 1769 – 10 December 1822 ) was a German poet and hymnwriter.  
 He was born in Staufen in the Prussian Province of Württemberg, into an influential upper-middle-class family of Gluckstern and Christoph Georges Giesche. Giesche was educated at the University of Freiburg and was ordained to the German Church in 1804. He taught at Stafjord and was headmaster of the primary school at Limnäs in the Beuthen province, part of the Schleswig-Holstein Province of Saxony. He is noted for his harmonics, verse, and poems.  
 He is known for the Giesche Psalter, which he wrote with his nephew Thomas ( 1777–1856 ) as well as the Giesche Marker. A reformer in Germany, his poetry also influenced poets such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Johann von Goethe.  
 The edition of his poems, the Deutsche Psalter und die gebildeten Gegenwart by Christoph von Mesmer, is considered his greatest achievement. The Giesche Psalter was printed from his collection of 40 hymns and compositions and by him is one of the most successful collection of hymn books of the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Hymnography ==  
   
 During the two centuries that he spent in the west, Giesche wrote over 200 works of literary verse and singing, most of them long and regular chants. His numerous hymn-books survive in many editions, as well as a. Volume 9 of Giesche's Tractatus gendremorum in prose style.

Wilhelm Lohr ( 27 July 1818, Klöden – 14 June 1881, Königsberg ) was a German physicist, best known for his development of the photographic paper microscope.  
 Lohr was born into an artistic family. His father, a clockmaker, was a member of the German Academy of Arts and Sciences. His mother was an artist, painter, and bibliographer. He became the first professor of medicine in Königsberg in 1845. He was appointed on 15 March 1848 to be the chair of optics in Königsberg.  
 A close friend and colleague of Felix Klein, he is chiefly remembered for developing the photographic paper microscope. He was elected an American Member of the Royal Society on 3 June 1848.  
 He remained in Königsberg for the rest of his life, remaining active as a lecturer and as an examiner.  
 A partnership was established with Klein to manufacture photographic paper telescopes at Königsberg. He was also engaged as an instructor for microscopes, who developed his own method. In 1871, he became director of the blind ( Dissertationzentrum Dissertationwissenschaft ), which in 1850 became the Königsberg Academy of Sciences, the oldest independent scientific school in Europe.  
 Lohr's most notable contribution was in the field of natural history, as he was the first to recognize the intrinsic significance of the mole.  
 He also discovered the trigeminal nerve and discovered the distinction between the type of neural flexion which facilitates finger movement ( anterior flexion ) and the type of neural flexion which inhibits it ( posterior flexion ).

Annie M. Knott ( 1 September 1850 – December 20 , 1941 ) was an early student of Mary Baker Eddy and became a Christian Science practitioner and teacher . She first turned to Christian Science in an emergency involving her toddler son , afterward taking up the study of the religion and devoting her life to it . She later became a member of the Bible Lesson Committee and was the first woman to become a member of the Christian Science Board of Directors .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born Annie Macmillan , one of three daughters to religious Presbyterian Covenanters William and Catherine Macmillan ( nee Kerr ) , in Stewarton , East Ayrshire , Scotland . By the age of eight , she had committed entire chapters of the Bible to memory . Her father was a cousin of the founders of the Macmillan Publishing Company , Daniel and his brother Alexander Macmillan.Her family emigrated to Ontario , Canada when she was a girl and she grew up there . In 1876 , she was married to Kennard Knott . In 1878 , they moved to England , where he had been born . While in the London area and acting on a long-held desire to help the sick , she did volunteer work in local hospitals , although she was herself in poor health with bronchitis and other ailments . She began investigating alternatives to medicine , such as homeopathy . In 1881 , her little boy died while under the care of a doctor who was a grandson of Samuel Hahnemann , founder of homeopathy.In January 1882 , Knott and her daughters , aged two and four , emigrated to Chicago , where her husband had already relocated . They soon had another child , a boy . One afternoon , when this child was approaching his second birthday , Knott heard him screaming in the kitchen and discovered he 'd swallowed much of a bottle of disinfectant , carbolic acid . Doctors arrived shortly and said they did n't expect him to survive and if he did , he 'd never be able to swallow normally . Desperate for help , she turned to Christian Science . The child was soon relieved from pain and the next morning , recovered completely , helping himself to an apple he found in the pantry . The experience changed Knott . She had already purchased the Christian Science textbook and had been reading it ; after the experience with her son , she began a more intensive study of the book , during which she found her health improving . She then began offering to help others . She also had primary class instruction with a Christian Scientist.Around this time , her husband abandoned the family . In 1885 , having friends in Detroit , Michigan , Knott and her children moved there from Chicago . In 1887 and 1888 , she had class instruction with Mary Baker Eddy , who had founded the Christian Science church based upon what she called her discovery of the `` Science of the Christ . '' She was given the certificate C.S.D .   
 As a Christian Science practitioner and teacher , and from 1889 to April 1895 , pastor , she became a prominent resident of Detroit and was invited to be one of the people , mostly men , to write letters for the Detroit Century Box , a time capsule organized by the mayor , William C. Maybury . Her letter , along with those from Maybury , James E. Scripps , D. Augustus Straker and more than 50 others , was sealed in a metal box at midnight on December 31 , 1900 .

 = David Hallo-Stransky =  
David Hallo-Stransky ( 21 August 1920 – 29 November 2006 ) was a mathematician at the University of California, Berkeley, who was the first person in the United States to use Gödel's incompleteness theorem to prove a class of solutions in Hilbert space. He also published a number of papers on non-monotonic integral equations of Hilbert space. He did work in both the differential geometry and classical theory of analysis and was the author of many other works.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hallo-Stransky was born in Riga, Latvia, on 21 August 1920, into a middle-class Jewish family. His father was a physician. His grandfather, Moshe Hallo-Stransky, was the founder of a bank in Riga. Hallo-Stransky attended secondary school in Riga. He entered the University of Latvia in 1932, after which he attended university in Dorton and Isem from 1933 to 1937.  
 During World War II, Hallo-Stransky volunteered for the army and, in January 1945, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Polish army. In 1946, after he had been imprisoned for a year, he was released. He returned to Dorton and then the University of Latvia in 1948.  
 The next academic year Hallo-Stransky taught physics at his alma mater, the University of Latvia. He received his PhD there in 1952. While still a professor, he became a professor of applied mathematics. The first work he published in mathematics was on solution of the Smolin–Domhoff problem in three dimensions.  
   
   
 == Gifted with a research specialty ==  
 Before becoming a professor, Hallo-Stransky was awarded a scholarship by the Galil organization in 1955. By 1957 he had published five papers in algebraic geometry, two in differential geometry, and one in classical theory of analysis. His thesis was on improved solutions of the Lie groups in second-order differential equations.  
   
   
 == Calculus of Variations ==  
 Hallo-Stransky submitted his solution of the Galil–Domhoff problem in two parts : the first part treated the Schola universal functions and the second part a very brief alternative to Poisson spaces. His proof, published in 1977, shows that a simple solution of the problems is obtainable using a simple unit function and one generalized definition of the Peano–Hermite cohomology in algebraic geometry.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 From 1976 to 1981 Hallo-Stransky was the George C. Hallo Foundation Professor of Theoretical Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the founding editor of the journal Mathematical Theory. He received an honoris causa degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1975.His most prestigious honors were :  
   
 1992, AER, the highest award of the American Mathematical Society  
 1993, IUPAC, the IUPAC mathematician of the year award  
 1996, American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( AMAS ), the highest honor given by AMAS to mathematicians  
 1999, Thomas Daggett Award, A. W. Kelly Institute for Mathematical Statistics, University of Michigan  
 2001, COSMIC mathematician of the year from the Mathematical Sciences Society of the Pacific

 = Iva Sharaf =  
Iva Sharaf ( 3 June 1837 – 18 May 1922 ) was an Israeli historian and academic. She was born in Cairo, Egypt. She became an Egyptologist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem ( HUJ ) and was an award-winning authority on the cultural and material treasures of Israel. In collaboration with her husband, professor Joseph Sharaf, she served as the chair of the Department of Archeology, Palestinian Exploration and Antiquities, and several others. She studied ancient Egypt under Margaret Hutton, the founder of Egyptology, with whom she met, and whose findings influenced her early work on the Israelite archaeological heritage. She was appointed in 1908 to the Jewish Publication Society's Chair of Egyptian Literature in Israel. After the First World War, she became a United States civilian foreign service employee. She died in Jerusalem of leukemia in 1922.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Iva Sharaf was the first of seven children born to Arab Hebrew students who immigrated to Palestine as early as 1869. According to a 2005 BBC Radio interview, my older sister Elisabeth was a lively woman who could travel and perform in Hebrew with complete fluency in at least 14 languages. Her brother, also named Yeboosh, later went on to join the Israeli military and teach at a yeshiva near Tel Aviv.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Iva Sharaf attended the Hebrew school in Cairo where she was friends with Nadia Bricfalus and Anna Serendi. She was a student at the Oriental Institute of the Hebrew University ( HUJ ) and at a Hebrew language school in Berlin. She held a Ph.D. in 1879 from HUJ on material from the tomb of Joseph Hayyim of Jerusalem. Sharaf was the first woman student to study in Berlin, and the first Jewish student to study in Paris. In 1885 she married Joseph Sharaf. They both lived in Jerusalem.  
   
   
 == Contributions to the Israeli antiquities ==  
 Sharaf's research concentrated on the Egyptian material and culture of the Second Intermediate Period ( 15,700–10,000 BCE ). Many of her findings concerned the geography, anatomy, stratigraphy, architecture, and inscriptions in the Great Pyramid of Giza ( 3,000 BCE ). Through the writings of Pierre Brion and Robert Howarth she was able to visualize a living Egyptian civilization in images. She was the first Israeli to send full manuscripts of her work to other scholars in other countries. In 1905, she wrote a volume on the Early Period, which continued work on the greatest Egyptian civilization of all time, the Egyptian Library of the Second Intermediate Period.  
 In 1913 she was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Palestine Antiquities Authority. In the 1930s, she worked in Jerusalem on the foundation of a new Egyptian museum. She was a founder and first chair of the Department of Egyptian literature and archaeology, the chair of the Department of Political Science at HUJ, the Chair of Oriental Studies at the HUJ, and the Chair of the Department of Egyptian and Near Eastern Studies at Yerushalayim.

Joachim Christian Timm ( 7 December 1734 – 3 February 1805 ) was a German apothecary , mayor of Malchin , and a botanist with a particular interest in cryptograms . This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Timm when citing a botanical name .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Joachim Christian Timm , the son of tobacconist Matthias Ernst Timm ( 1704–1779 ) , was born in Wangerin in Farther Pomerania , Prussia ( now in Poland ) and attended school there . In 1749 he started a five-year apprenticeship as an apothecary , initially with Friedrich John in Wangerin , where he served for a year as an assistant . In the 1750s he was in Mecklenburg , working in Rostock . At the end of the 1750s he moved to Malchin to manage the apothecary business of Georg Heinrich Kruger and his successors . In 1760 , Timm became the official apothecary of Malchin . In 1771 he was elected senator . In 1778 he became the Second or Vice-Mayor of Malchin , becoming the Mayor in 1790 . The tradition of having more than one mayor to lead the town ended with his death .   
 As an apothecary , he was interested in botany . He enthusiastically collected plants of all kinds , especially cryptogams , primarily in the Malchin area . In 1788 he published his work Florae megapolitanae Prodromus , which he based on the system of the Swedish botanist Linnaeus . Professor Johann Hedwig of Leipzig later named a genus of moss Timmia after him , including the species he found at Malchin in Mecklenburg , Timmia megapolitana . The epithet megapolitania here refers to Mecklenburg , which was then often referred to by the Greek equivalent megapolis . At the instigation of the author of a monograph on Timmia , Guy Brassard , a mountain on the Arctic Ellesmere Island was named `` Mount Timmia '' in honour of Timm .   
 In 1762 , Timm married Anna Christine Elisabeth Witte ( 1743–1792 ) , a merchant 's daughter from Röbel . They had ten children , including the sons Joachim ( 1768–1801 ) and Hans Timm ( 1774–1852 ) , who one after the other succeeded their father as the official apothecary in Malchin . Another son , Helmuth Timm ( 1782–1848 ) , became a pastor in Groß Gievitz and later in Malchin .   
 Joachim Christian Timm died in Malchin in 1805 and is regarded today as a pioneer of modern botany in Germany .

Auguste Valéry ( 29 September 1829 – 8 January 1902 ) was a French pioneer of the Neo-Georgian schools of philology and linguistics. He was a scientist of classical philology in the region, a leading specialist of the period when Greek and Babylonian were used as a common language.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Poitiers ( Poitier-Foucauld ), where his father, a colonel of the French army, grew up. His grandfather, in 1804, took him to the French East India Company territory and he was employed in work in the workshops of Jaques-Louis Augereau in Tripoli ( 1815–1818 ), now part of the French colony of Tunisia. After the departure of the army, he studied at the Sorbonne, obtaining a doctorate with a thesis on `` The Creative Genius of Aristotle '', which gave a better description of the mind of the philosopher than any previous work. In 1847, the Jewish section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts held him as their guest.  
 In 1849, he obtained his habilitation at the Sorbonne, where, with the assistance of the leading pedagogue Augereau, he worked to modernize the literary studies of a confused and backward tribe of French people who had no previous educational capital. Valéry began his career as a teacher and secretary of the Montmartre School. At this time he met and married the widow of a farmer. As a literary critic, Valéry devised a French system of comparative philology, based on a grammar and a theory of speech. In this work, he traced the difference of ancient languages, comparing its grammatical structure with that of modern languages ; and elucidated and elaborated upon the later, childlike speech of Hebrew and other Semitic languages. He was the first to set forth the major core elements of Greek and Babylonian, as they had developed from prehistory up to the time of Alexander the Great.  
   
 He left for Constantinople, where he made collections of the Babylonian language and edited the `` Catalogue des mouvements archéologiques des régions Assyriens '' ( 1853–58 ), subsequently published as Echige och hordomarktige der Babyloner-Religionskunde, 1–4 ( 1856–59 ). In 1868 he received from the Empress Catherine the Wood

Vilém Kurz ( 23 December 1872 – 25 May 1945 ) was a Czech pianist and renowned piano teacher .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Kurz was born in Německý Brod , Bohemia in 1872 . He became a professor at the State Conservatory in Lviv and Vienna , and Prague Conservatory .   
 His students included his daughter Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová , Rudolf Firkušný , Eduard Steuermann , Artur Rodziński , Břetislav Bakala , Pavel Štěpán , Stanislav Heller , František Maxián , Gidéon Klein , Rafael Schächter , Viktorie Švihlíková , Stefania Turkewich , Ilja Hurník , Drahomir Toman , Zdeněk Jílek and Matusja Blum . See : List of music students by teacher : K to M # Vilém Kurz .   
 His teaching methods were largely based on those of Theodor Leschetizky and his pupils he met during the time he taught in Lviv . Later they were further developed by his daughter Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová .   
 He died in Prague in 1945 .   
    
    
 == Antonin Dvořák 's Piano Concerto in G minor ==   
 Kurz is known for his reworking of the solo part of Antonín Dvořák 's Piano Concerto in G minor , Op . 33 , which was originally composed in 1876 . For more than a decade after the concerto 's first performance , it suffered from neglect and critical disdain . A common remark for many years was that the piano part was written `` as if for two right hands . ''   
 While he was in his 20s , Kurz undertook a revision of the solo part , and it is this version that he frequently performed . Since that time , the original and the Kurz versions have been printed together in Otakar Šourek 's critical edition of the score , one beneath the other , so that the soloist can choose which version to perform . The Kurz version has become a part of the standard piano repertoire . Dvořák 's original orchestral material is not affected by the soloist 's choice . In 1919 Ilona Kurzová played the first performance of the Kurz version of the concerto , conducted by Václav Talich . This revision was later adopted and recorded by Rudolf Firkušný , who in the 1950s also introduced a few cuts to the first and third movements . In the 1970s he abandoned all revisions in favour of the original version by Dvořák .   
 Supraphon , the Czech recording company , issued a compact disc on which Ivan Moravec plays the Kurz version , with the Czech Philharmonic conducted by Jiří Bělohlávek , while Radoslav Kvapil plays the composer 's original score , with the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra under František Jílek .

 = Focussed solely on nuclear fission, Duke C. Calvert ( 1933–2008 ) did little to attract attention to the need for caution and further research into both fission and the role of radioactive isotopes.  
 In 1934, Calvert suggested that high pressures of nuclear fusion might lead to powerful fission reactors, but that only it be brought to full power, at a rate of between 500 and 1,000 Gy. His proposal was then republished and translated into the original Russian and French.  
 His next book, The Century of Disaster, argued that nuclear fission could be harnessed to power an interstellar mission to Mars, but even that would involve major alterations to the physical infrastructure of the Red Planet.  
 In 1935, Calvert went on a double-length expedition to the Moon, studying and theorising about lunar and Martian processes. In one of his first recorded appearances at the Imperial College, London, he was hailed as an `` unsung hero '' by crowds at the club. In 1937, Calvert attended the nuclear physics conference that Albert Einstein was attending in Vienna that year. There, Calvert gave a speech about the need for continued investigation of the hidden dangers of nuclear fission.  
   
   
 == Briefcase for Energy Need ==  
 Duke Calvert set up an apparatus for delivering the energy from the atomic bomb in an emergency suit, but later said that it was a joke and fell flat on its face in the Moscow airfield. When Victor Gollancz started a similar device, he did not use the actual bomb, but used a portable hydrogen bomb instead. Calvert conducted a similar demonstration in London in 1935. Calvert also developed the concept of the `` harness '' – a device that could transfer the energy directly from the atomic bomb to the device by exploding it with hydrogen, generating a very large amount of energy. Calvert theorised that this sort of reactor would be practical, and he paid for the spectrographs. He then suggested to the High Commissioner for Nuclear Research in Washington that a reactor of this type could be built with few ecological risks, as a part of the Bombardment Programme, which was a massive disarmament campaign carried out by the government to promote a peaceful civilian nuclear energy industry.

Hans Merensky ( 16 March 1871 in Botshabelo – 21 October 1952 on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof ) was a South African geologist , prospector , scientist , conservationist and philanthropist . He discovered the rich deposit of alluvial diamonds at Alexander Bay in Namaqualand , vast platinum and chrome reefs at Lydenburg , Rustenburg and Potgietersrus , which led to some of the largest platinum mines in the world , phosphates and copper at Phalaborwa in the Transvaal lowveld , gold in the Free State and the world ’ s biggest chrome deposit at Jagdlust near Pietersburg .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Hans Merensky was born on 16 March 1871 at Berlin Missionary Society station Botshabelo , near Middelburg in Transvaal , where his father , Alexander Merensky ( 1837–1918 ) , a noted ethnographer and author , was the resident missionary . Keenly interested in minerals and enjoying outdoor living , he studied mining geology after finishing his schooling in Germany . He was awarded a doctorate in mining geology from the University of Charlottenburg in Berlin . He completed his practical training in coal mines in the Saarland and in Silesia and began work for the Department of Mines in East Prussia . In 1904 he came to South Africa to conduct some geological surveys in the Transvaal . He discovered tin near Pretoria and reported to the Premier Diamond Mine regarding possible mining prospects . He worked for several mining companies and Friedlaender & Co. sent him to Madagascar to investigate a reported discovery of gold , which turned out to be false . He resigned from his job in Germany and moved to Johannesburg where he became a successful consulting geologist .   
 In 1909 he visited the diamond fields of South West Africa and controversially predicted that diamonds would be found along the West coast and south of the Orange River . In 1913 Merensky lost his entire fortune due to the Depression , and was interned at a camp near Pietermaritzburg . During these financially difficult years he enjoyed the support of Sir George Albu .   
 In 1924 he followed up the discovery of alluvial platinum by A F Lombard on his farm in Lydenburg and discovered its source in the Bushveld Igneous Complex which set him on the road to financial recovery . This deposit came eventually to be known as the Merensky Reef , which contains 75 per cent of the world 's known platinum resources.In 1926 diamonds were found at Alexander Bay and Merensky received £1,250,000 for his prospector 's share . He established the Phosphate Development Corporation Ltd. - FOSKOR - to manage the extraction of phosphates at Phalaborwa .   
 In his final years he lived unostentatiously on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof in Transvaal , where he received local celebrities and foreign dignitaries . He died on 21 October 1952 .

 Fagnano is best known for investigations on the length and division of arcs of certain curves , especially the lemniscate ; this seems also to have been in his own estimation his most important work , since he had the figure of the lemniscate with the inscription : `` Multifariam divisa atque dimensa Deo veritatis gloria '' , engraved on the title-page of his Produzioni Matematiche , which he published in two volumes ( Pesaro , 1750 ) , and dedicated to Pope Benedict XIV . The same figure and words `` Deo veritatis gloria '' also appear on his tomb .   
 Failing to rectify the ellipse or hyperbola , Fagnano attempted to determine arcs whose difference is rectifiable .   
 The word `` rectifiable '' meant at that time that the length can be found explicitly ,   
 which is different from its modern   
 meaning . He also pointed out the remarkable analogy existing between the integrals which represent the arc of a circle and the arc of a lemniscate . He also proved the formula

 = William Gibbons (theologian) =  
William Gibbons ( 15 December 1603 – 29 May 1649 ) was an English theologian, and one of the first and most influential Puritans. The following section contains all of Gibbons'sermons.  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Gibbons was the son of a gentleman farmer, and was born at Stoneham, Leicestershire, on 15 December 1603. Gibbons studied theology in London, studying the works of Charles Fauconius, Thomas, Webster, Thomas Bayly, Robert Boff and John Yardley. His father sent him to the church of Porthcurno, Hertfordshire, but soon returned to the family farm in Hartwood, Hertfordshire, where he soon commenced to preach and write.  
   
   
 === Church career ===  
 Gibbons was a professor of divinity at the College of Hertfordshire. He was ordained to the ministry in 1618 and was appointed rector at St. Gregory's in Winchester in 1620. In 1623 he returned to Westminster, where he preached three years until he retired on 28 January 1626. He returned to Glastonbury as a priest in 1638. He made another disputation in Westminster. He died there on 29 May 1649.  
   
   
 === John Squire ===  
 Gibbons was the nephew of John Squire ( 12 October 1631 – 23 December 1671 ) and grandson of the Rev. John Squire, and sister of the Rev. William Squire. John Squire died on 21 December 1671, leaving John Gibbons a significant portion of his family.  
   
   
 === Bishop's Priory ===  
 Gibbons was consecrated bishop of High Court in Hertfordshire on 17 June 1622. He was removed to Westminster on 12 February 1630 ; he was re-appointed rector on 19 May 1634, and was made deputy pastor at High Court in 1639. His disputation was an ecclesiastical one and devoted himself to the general outline of the late history of Christendom. Gibbons'approach to orthodoxy was liberal, using material drawn from recent tradition. Although the protestant congregation was made by Queen Elizabeth I to withdraw its support, Gibbons was not present when her religion was denounced as heretical by Richard Rylands ( after long discussions in the convocation chamber ). Gibbons married Rebecca Beck ( b. 1738 ) in Hertfordshire in 1641, and they were divorced in 1649. In 1650 he was confirmed to the rectorship of Water Street. He was again rector of High Court in 1659, then of St. John in 1663, and in 1667 became vicar at Mansfield.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Gibbons was strongly opposed to the Reform Acts of the Nineteenth Century. He wrote against them and tried to hold the reformed church together in various ways.Gibbons founded several congregations and subsequently developed his own evangelical ministry, and was much influenced by T. S. Eliot, who had successively preached to various congregations at his home at Eaton's Lane, in Bury St Edmunds ( Oxford ).  
   
 The volume on Gibbons was published under the pseudonym David Towson ( a mixture of `` Gibbon, with ear spurs '' and `` Towson, a little previous to 1688, had painted this portrait of Sir John Henry '' ), with several later revisions by John Garnett ( 1666–1740 ), and was never publicly published. The second edition is held by the Chelsea and Clapham Evangelical Church Museum.

 = William Stone (composer) =  
William Clay Stone ( 11 August 1869 – 9 May 1925 ) was an English conductor and pianist. He was notable for his pioneering approach to orchestral composition and worked in London until his death.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Stone was born in Camden, London, where his father was a piano virtuoso, conductor and schoolmaster. His father worked for the Royal Observatory ( now the Royal Liverpool College of Music ) and his mother taught at Camberwell School for Boys. In 1875 he entered The Royal Academy of Music, Kingston upon Thames ( now the Royal Academy of Music ) where he graduated with First Class honours in 1878 and was awarded a Fellowship of the Academy in December 1879.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The British music critic Thomas Hamill commented, `` As well as producing this year's striking, magnificent symphonic suite, Beethoven in C Major oratorio, a great many splendid plays have appeared in his many years since passing through that respected institution, and when he was away from St John's College, London, his works were set for many years. '' A popularist was heaped upon the arches of The King's Chapel at St Paul's Cathedral, while alongside his other notable works, he made the acquaintance of the recently married Lady Grace Hoole.  
 The 20-year-old Stone had first been approached by Henry Pickering, the conductor of the London Philharmonic, who offered him a position as conductor at The Royal Academy of Music in August 1881. He married his first wife of 32 years on 1 December 1884. Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter : Harry with who he had two daughters and two sons with Edith with whom he had a son, and Colin with whom he also had two daughters.  
 After the marriage, Stone began to work closely with Pickering on his works. He was instrumental in establishing relations with the composer as well as securing appointments on the London Chamber Orchestra.  
   
   
 == Orchestral career ==  
 After his resignation from The Royal Academy of Music, Stone took a position as Principal Conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ( now the Royal Philharmonic Society ). He was also created conductor of a concert choir which would have traditionally been conducted by an accompanist in St John's College, and served as head of the London Philharmonic from 1891-1897. Stone travelled widely as an important adviser to the composer, notably on recording sessions during his first term at The Royal Academy of Music and his return to the Boston Philharmonic, including playing an unaccompanied cello concerto for his first recording, in 1909, two years after the Boston Philharmonic disbanded.  
 Stone conducted the Op. 37 String Quintet ( 1917–19 ) and the 10 Symphonies ( 1920–24 ) which he was set to conduct during the Mendelssohn-Warner String Quartet, as well as the Tenth Symphony, which he succeeded in making during his brief tenure. He also conducted performances of Thalia's Theatre ( 1919–20 ) and the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Concert Pieces and the Elegy for the Dying Lady. On his return to London, Stone hosted the Gerhard Richter and Paul Hindemith String Quartet ( 1924 ), which was set to feature the Manchester Symphony Orchestra.The LSO was disbanded in 1935. He was succeeded as principal conductor by Walter Glasberg. However, it is believed that in later years he would have returned to orchestration.

 = Gardner Lindzey =   
Gardner Edmund Lindzey ( November 27 , 1920 – February 4 , 2008 ) was an American psychologist and a past president of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) . After completing a doctorate at Harvard University , Lindzey served as a professor or administrator at several universities , edited a well-known textbook in social psychology and led a 1982 National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) panel that recommended the legalization of marijuana .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
    
 === Early life and education ===   
 Lindzey was born on November 27 , 1920 in Wilmington , Delaware . He attended Penn State University , earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in psychology . In 1949 , he finished a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University .   
    
    
 === Academic career ===   
 After teaching briefly at Harvard and spending several years at Syracuse University , Lindzey joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota . Psychologist and fellow faculty member Elliot Aronson described Lindzey as `` the star of the round table , an entertaining storyteller and a catalyst of conversation . And he seemed to know everything about everyone 's research ... But he would always find a way to make each person 's research relevant to the interests of the other people at the table . `` He chaired the psychology department at the University of Texas between 1964 and 1969 . Later , the university credited him with `` transforming the department from a relatively small and unassuming group to a large and internationally recognized faculty . '' Lindzey made contributions to personality psychology , social psychology , the history of psychology and behavioral genetics . He moved into educational administration at Texas , becoming the vice president for academic affairs and remaining there until 1975 . He then became the longest-serving director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences ( CASBS ) , running the center between 1975 and 1989 after completing fellowships there in 1954 , 1964 and 1972.In 1982 , he was a key member ( immediate past chair ) of the NAS committee that recommended the decriminalization of marijuana in An Analysis of Marijuana Policy , a report commissioned several years earlier by the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Other committee members included psychiatrist Daniel X. Freedman , former U.S. drug czar Jerome Jaffe , sociologists Denise Kandel and Howard S. Becker , psychologist and future university and foundation president Judith Rodin , future Nobel Prize winner in economics Thomas Schelling , and former CBS president Frank Stanton . The report highlighted the costs associated with the 400,000 annual marijuana-related arrests . When the report was published , NAS president Frank Press included a cover letter with it that criticized the report . Press thought that the committee had overstepped its bounds with its conclusions , which he said were better left to the political process . National Institute on Drug Abuse director William Pollin also said that it was `` a terrible mistake and a public health tragedy '' to advocate for societal acceptance of marijuana use .   
    
    
 === Later life ===   
 An athlete in high school , Lindzey continued to play tennis for several years after his retirement . He was ill for the last couple of years of his life . He spent some time in hospice care , but he was able to return to work as an editor almost up to the time that he died .   
    
    
 === Personal ===   
 Lindzey married Andrea Lewis in 1944 and they had five children . She died in 1984 . In his later years , he had a companion , a psychologist named Lyn Carlsmith .

Matteo Liberatore ( born at Salerno , Italy , 14 August 1810 ; died at Rome , 18 October 1892 ) was an Italian Jesuit philosopher , theologian , and writer . He helped popularize the Jesuit periodical Civiltà Cattolica in close collaboration with the papacy in the last half of the 19th century .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Matteo was the son of Nicola Liberatore , a magistrate , and Caterina De Rosa who was from a noble Albanian family of Barile . He studied at the College of the Jesuits at Naples in 1825 , and a year later applied for admission into the Society of Jesus , entering the novitiate on 9 October 1826 . He taught philosophy at the Jesuit college of Naples for eleven years , from 1837 until the Revolution of 1848 drove him to Malta.On returning to Italy he was appointed to teach theology , but gave up his professorship in 1850 to cofound Civiltà Cattolica , a periodical founded by the Jesuits to defend the cause of the Church and the papacy , and to spread the knowledge of the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas . Liberatore 's helped bring about the revival of the scholastic philosophy of Aquinas , publishing his own course of philosophy in 1842 . This movement he promoted in the classroom , by textbooks on philosophy , by articles in Civiltà Cattolica and other periodicals , by larger and more extensive works , and also by his work as a member of the Accademia Romana by appointment of Leo XIII . In 1879 he contributed to Leo XIII 's encyclical Aeterni Patris on scholastic philosophy , promoting the teaching of Thomism in all Catholic schools . He also collaborated in the writing of the encyclical Immortale Dei ( 1885 ) and of Leo 's ground-breaking social encyclical Rerum novarum ( 1893 ) .   
 For 42 years , from 1850 to 1892 , Liberatore published over 390 articles , many apologetic in defense of the Holy See , drawing attention to Civiltà Cattolica . He predicted a more universal role for the papacy with the loss of temporal power . He was a close collaborator with Pius IX and Leo XIII and taught a philosophy course at the Pontifical Gregorian University where his students included Ambrogio Ratti , the future Pope Pius XI .

 = Konrad Trier =  
Konrad Friedrich Hermann Trier ( 20 September 1883 – 16 November 1974 ) was a German physicist and discoverer of neutron interactions.  
 He was born in Basel. In 1907 he received his doctorate from the Technical University of Munich under Alfred Siemens. In 1914 he started working with Karl Albert Gottlob Werner and Charles James Fogg at the University of Cambridge. In 1921 he received his habilitation from the University of Leipzig.  
 Trier is best known for the Trier–Einstein combination. This arrangement allows neutrons to be emitted from a neutron source which is surrounded by matter. An electron can not therefore decay inside a neutron generator as it can only emit neutrons from the outside. This was discovered by Reinhold Messner and Nobel Prize winner Harold T. Compton in 1925. In 1923, the discovery led to the realization that the interaction between hydrogen nuclei and a neutron produces the active nucleus and thus, the required mass of the nucleus.In 1946, his group discovered the `` strong negative interaction '' in supersymmetry that results when pairs of elements are released from a solid state of matter that is composed of a chemical bond. Trier used data from pulsed nuclear physics, the spin tunneling method, and the debye mass function to prove that the interaction in a nuclear reactor should always produce the major component of the gamma ray.  
 He worked on M-theory of proton emission, currently known as Trier's equations for proton decays.  
 Trier died in Jena, Germany on 16 November 1974.

 Max Burkert was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, into a well-established farming family. He graduated in 1863 from the local Polytechnic Institute ( Neustadter til Geologiski Storting ), the state school in Oslo, and later studied at the city's theological seminary. In 1867, he married Dorothea Bent-Heinemann, with whom he had two children : a daughter Grete ( 1871–1922 ) and a son Einar ( 1876–1954 ).  
 In 1874 he began lecturing at the University of Oslo, where he remained until his death in 1933.  
 In 1870, he started his geological work, the Stangeltenrengar expedition, carried out by his son Adolf Burkert, with whom he travelled to several places on the Arabian Sea, from the far north to the Ethiopian coast. Two years later, he became the first geologist to study the floor of the Great Sea, taking advantage of a shipwreck there to collect samples of marine strata in the sand.

 = Mathias Els =  
Mathias Els ( 13 September 1865 – 8 December 1934 ) was a Norwegian priest and professor who specialized in psychoanalysis. His many publications included two works, Dramatisches Psychoanalytische Studie ( 1894 ) and Die Psychoanalyse der Meriten ( 1907 ).  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Mathias Els was born at Falenburg in the province of Aarhus, Norway. His father was Joakim Els, a teacher and schoolmaster, and his mother was Cid Haarau. Els studied at the Gymnasium in Aarhus and received his degree in 1884. After moving to Bergen in 1887, he taught at a boarding school in nearby Danmark for twelve years and then to a secondary school in Aarhus.  
 In 1891, Els became acquainted with Sidney Weinberg. The two began to exchange correspondence ; Weinberg requested Els to join his study group and had Els enrolled at the University of Aarhus as a freshman in 1892. He studied psychoanalysis with Heinrich Baer, Abraham Ruckman and Vilhelm Haraldsen. Els also corresponded with Johann Malina Lofven ( 1831–1881 ), Wolfgang Kornhauser ( 1846–1911 ) and Wilhelm Mitterleben ( 1849–1912 ).  
 Els and Weinberg were commissioned in 1895 by Albrecht von Siemens to lead a psychoanalysis program at St. Peter's, the town in the Moravian mining district near Oslo, and in the beginning Els chose to study religion, his only field of study.  
 In 1909, they started a psychoanalytic training program at the New Religious Seminary. Since then Els taught at the university as well as at the Norwegian Association for Psychical Research and the psychology school in Aarhus ( 1951–1955 ). He also headed the psychoanalytic department at the new Polytechnic ( 1960–1972 ) and the Norway Regional Institute of Cognitive Therapy in Oslo ( 1975–1985 ). The doctoral thesis for the year 1980 in his original doctoral thesis was titled `` Interpersonal identity and speech ''.  
 Els founded the Oslo Psychoanalytical Training Clinic and placed its primary research area into the home. Els was named chairman of the Institute for Research in Psychoanalysis ( 1961 ). A protest against the apartheid South Africa for the first years of apartheid resulted in Els being fired in 1969.  
 A number of academic institutions were founded by him. The University of Aarhus, Norway, has named a department of psychology in honor of Els. He also founded a general practice in his honor. He also won several prizes from the Norwegian Society for Clinical Psychology and later from the Wissenschaftskrift für psychische und psychanalyse der Naturwissenschaften ( International Association for Psychoanalysis ).  
 In 1902, a conference titled `` The Psychology of Religion '' was held in Aarhus to identify theoretical contributions to the research and development of psychoanalysis. Els became the director of the conference in 1906 and became a founding member of the Norwegian Psychological Association ( NOP ).  
 In 1904, he published the article in which he proposed a two-stage method of exploring unconscious phenomena. The first stage involved clear and forcible exploration, the second stage—which concerned the emotional map—involved a more subtle, emotional and ritualized exploration.

 = Jean de Londel =  
Jean de Londel ( 21 November 1799 – 5 December 1885 ) was a French biblical scholar and Protestant theologian.Londel was born in Auchterard, the son of a butcher. He graduated from the Conservatoire des arts in 1815 with a degree in theology and later the Aix-en-Provence Conservatoire.  
 At that time Londel was deeply engaged in the work of Hérmann-Camille Héry ( c. 1680–1713 ). Following Héry's death in 1755, Londel took up his work full-time and he was ordained a priest in Auchterard in 1817. In 1822 he was elected a member of the Académie française. He was also a pioneer of the Bible translation and Germanische Bibel. Londel, along with François Braunecker, translated and published a series of thirty-nine Hebrew publications published between 1818 and 1824. A number of these were edited by Henri-François Lavy ( a contemporary of Londel ). His own translations remained unpublished until after his death. In 1829 he published a History of the English Bible published by Jakob Lyell and Sergius von Hristov, which was afterwards edited by Georges Cailleux.Londel is best known for his careful studies of biblical exegesis, the biblical prophecies in the Old Testament, and later the influence of such men as J. S. Mill and Jacob Haubelmann on the Protestant Reformation.  
 Londel held that Daniel 23 and 29–32 were prophetic and had particular significance for the present day. In the following years he developed a much more orthodox version of Daniel 4:1–3, though his earlier version did not differ much from that of Christopher Hooker ( 1654–1727 ). In his treatise de l'église apologique, published in 1826, he argued that the Bible had no authority over human reason, but only over God.Londel joined the Royal College of Pensacola ( RCP ) in 1823, and soon after became the fourth president. His lectures at the college were important for his theological studies. He remained affiliated to the RCP until 1832, when, upon the retirement of his first president, Victor H. van Hempel, the position was held by Gerard Seely ( 1803–1861 ). Seely was brought up in orthodox Protestant circles, and had close ties with the theologians of the faculty of classics. Some of his historical writings on the literary history of the Bible survive in the Bibliothèque royale d'Histoire naturelle et de l'histoire philosophique de Jean-Baptiste Londel. In 1836, he gained the title of professor in religious and practical theology.

 == Biography ==  
 The son of a printing printer, Jesman was educated at Innes College in 1819, and St John's College, Cambridge. In 1827, Jesman first went to study medicine at the University of Leipzig. He obtained his medical doctorate with two lectures in medicine and in the same year, in addition, received a doctorate of philosophy.  
 While attending classes at Cambridge, Jesman went to work as a private physician in Kent, and from 1834 to 1837 he was resident physician to John York, then the mayor of London. In 1837, Jesman was appointed a lecturer at Magdalen College, Oxford, from where he obtained his doctorate in 1842. Jesman continued to teach for the rest of his life in Oxford.  
 In 1852, when he returned to London, he took up his post as tutor at St Bartholomew's College, London, and taught for the next three years. In 1854, while still at St Bartholomew's College, Jesman accepted a post as professor of anthropology at Queen's College, Kingston upon Hull. When Henry Owen arrived at Hull in 1857, Jesman was appointed as his temporary assistant. While working at Queen's, Jesman published a considerable amount of work in the field of anthropology, especially in the field of comparative anatomy. In 1860, Jesman became a member of the Association of the Royal Anthropological Institute, and was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1864.  
 Jesman died in Hull.

 == Biography ==   
 Michaud was the son of a teacher who stimulated his son 's passion for natural sciences . He signed up for the infantry in 1813 . He was injured twice during the siege of Metz ( 1814–1815 ) . After his recovery in 1815 he became fully interested in natural sciences and began a conchological collection . When his father died in 1817 , he decided to stay in the army to support his family . His career went well and he became an officer in 1823 .   
 He started to publish his first scientific paper between 1828 and 1831 , dealing mainly with Mediterranean molluscs . In 1831 he published his major work , the Complément to the works of Draparnaud ( 1805 ) . In 1833 he wrote a first paper on the terrestrial molluscs of Algeria . From 1837 on he became interested in fossils , and started to publish several papers dealing with palaeomalacology . Together with Valéry Louis Victor Potiez ( 1806–1870 ) he published in 1835 the Galerie des mollusques , a catalogue of the molluscs in the collection of the museum of Douai .   
 In 1839 he became a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur , mainly because of his scientific contributions rather than because of his military service .   
 He left the army in 1844 , and started work as a professor and director of the Michaud Institute in Lyons . From then on he applied himself completely to the study of molluscan fossils . He published several papers ( 1855 , 1862 , 1876 , 1877 ) uncovering the Miocene fauna of the basin of Hauterives ( Drôme ) .   
 Part of his malacological collection is still preserved at the museum of Lyons . The rest of his collection , which was donated to museums in Brive and Mâcon has largely been lost .

 = William E. Richardson =  
William Edmund Richardson ( 28 January 1879 – 13 February 1940 ) was an American physicist and economist. He was Professor of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin, 1919–1923, and Academician of the University of Texas until his retirement in 1946.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Richardson was born in Jackson, Tennessee, and attended Louisiana High School. He graduated from McGill University in 1910, then entered Columbia College, Columbia, Missouri, as a mathematics major and received the bachelor's degree in 1910.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Richardson taught mathematics at the University of Mississippi from 1912 to 1917, and then from 1917 to 1922 at Columbia College, Columbia, Missouri, graduating with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1923. From 1927 to 1936 he was associate professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin.Richardson taught at the University of Missouri from 1935 to 1941, but was succeeded in 1941 by Paul Taylor. He then taught at the University of Texas at Austin from 1942 to 1947, and then worked as a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin until his retirement in 1946. He spent one year as chancellor of the University of Kansas and was admitted to the National Academy of Sciences, in 1962.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Richardson was the first to exploit the utility of building-stock pricing in the United States. His papers have been widely cited by economists and trade policy analysts, and his book The Future of Economics ( 1932 ) described the large ramifications of his theory. In those days, the price of technology did not represent the true market value, but rather the difference between what could be purchased at the unit price and what could be purchased as a percentage of the useful life of a particular product.He also developed a theory of the Nodal ( sector ) element that connects the technology sector to the economy's manufacturing. According to this theory, technological innovation moves in both directions, in one direction, leading to a rise in product demand, and in the other direction, a decline in demand.  
 Richardson had many publications on a wide variety of topics. The Handbook of Central Economic Ideas, an academic tool for managing the war in Europe from 1941 to 1945, was the first introduction to Richardson's concept of the Nodal. He also became widely known for his theoretical discussions on abstract economic theory and was considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of economics.By the 1950s, Richardson had played a leading role in shaping the campus climate at the University of Texas at Austin in 1957, especially in the free market system textbooks that were widely used. He had been a founder member of the academic Journal of Social Issues, as well as the author of numerous popular books and articles.

 = Jean-Pierre Minckelers =   
Jean-Pierre or Jan Pieter Minckelers ( also Minkelers , Minckeleers ) ( 1748-1824 ) was a Dutch academic and inventor of coal gasification and illuminating gas .   
 Minckelers was the son of Anna Margaretha Denis en Laurens Michael Minckelers , a pharmacist in Maastricht . After finishing Latin school in his hometown at the age of 15 , he went to the University of Leuven ( French : Louvain ) , where he studied theology and philosophy at the Collegium Falconis . In 1771 he became a deacon and the next year he became professor of natural philosophy . From 1778 Minckelers focussed on the study of gasses . He worked closely with Jan Frans Thijsbaert ( Jean-François Thysbaert ; 1736–1825 ) , director of the school of experimental physics at the university , and it was under Thysbaert 's direction that he did his experiments on coal gas.In the early 1780s the question of aerostats and Montgolfier balloons was occupying the mind of scientists , and Louis Engelbert , 6th Duke of Arenberg , a promoter of science and art , engaged Minckelers , Thysbaert en Carolus van Bochaute , a third natural philosopher at the university , to address the question of the best gas for balloon purposes . In 1784 , after many experiments , Minckelers published a work entitled Mémoire sur l'air inflammable tiré de différentes substances , rédigé par M. Minkelers , professeur de philosophie au collège du Faucon , université de Louvain ( Louvain , 1784 ) . As an appendix to this memoir there was a Table de gravités spécifiques des différentes espèces d'air by Thysbaert .   
 In his memoir Minckelers relates how he made his discovery : from the very beginning of his experiments he had had the idea of enclosing oil in the barrel of a gun and heating it in a forge . Under action of the heat the oil dissolved and gave way to a very light gas , having other advantageous qualities . Having proved that oil gas was the best for balloons , Minckelers used it for many balloons which rose rapidly and travelled great distances in the neighbourhood of Leuven in 1783 . As we learn from his pupil von Hulstein , who was in his class in 1785 , Minckelers at times used this same gas to light his lecture hall . Later on some students ' bedrooms were lit by gas as well . Moreover , the drift of his memoir proves clearly that in its inventor 's eyes the great combustibility of the gas was one of its leading qualities . When Joseph II , in 1788 , transferred the Catholic University of Leuven to Brussels , Minckelers continued as professor . During the Brabant Revolution , Brussels was besieged and Minckelers was forced to flee , leaving his equipment behind . The gaslight apparatus is thought to have survived until World War I . As a supporter of the emperor , he could not regain his position when the University moved back to Leuven . He officially resigned in 1794 and was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the Central School of Maastricht . While not at a center of higher learning , he proceeded to do research , among others on meteorology and on a Mosasaurus skeleton discovered in a local limestone quarry in 1800 .   
 In 1816 he became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands . He retired in 1818 and died six years later in his hometown of Maastricht .   
 Minckelers is remembered as an inventor of coal gasification and gas lighting and as the first to do this at a practical scale . On Maastricht 's market square stands a statue , created by Bart van Hove , that carries an `` eternal '' gas light . For sustainability and budget reasons , the flame is coin operated since 2006 . Another statue of him is in Heverlee near the science buildings of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven . A number of schools and streets in the Netherlands and Belgium carry his name , including a street in the center of Leuven .

 Hartogs main work was in several complex variables where he is known for   
 Hartogs 's theorem , Hartogs 's lemma ( also known as Hartogs 's principle or Hartogs 's extension theorem ) and the concepts of holomorphic hull and domain of holomorphy .   
 In set theory , he contributed to the theory of wellorders and proved what is also known as Hartogs 's theorem : for every set x there is a wellordered set that can not be injectively embedded in x .   
 The smallest such set is known as the Hartogs number or Hartogs Aleph of x .

Leon D. Harmon ( 1922 - 1983 ) was a researcher in mental/neural processing , particularly regarding vision , who worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories , Incorporated .   
 Harmon started his career as a radio serviceman and electronics hobbyist . In 1950 , he went to work as a wireman on the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study , where he worked for Julian Bigelow and encountered John von Neumann and Albert Einstein . At the same time he began taking night courses in engineering at New York University . When the IAS project ended in 1956 , he joined Bell Laboratories where he worked on human perception , computer vision and graphics .   
 In 1966 , Harmon and Kenneth C. Knowlton were experimenting with photomosaic , creating large prints from collections of small symbols or images . In Studies in Perception I they created an image of a reclining nude ( the dancer Deborah Hay ) , by scanning a photograph with a camera and converting the analog voltages to binary numbers which were assigned typographic symbols based on halftone densities . It was printed in The New York Times on 11 October 1967 , and exhibited as part of the Experiments in Art and Technology ( EAT ) competition at , The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age , held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City from November 25 , 1968 through February 9 , 1969.Harmon is best known for his highly pixelated , block portrait of Abraham Lincoln from the five dollar bill . It was created to illustrate his November , 1973 , Scientific American article , `` The Recognition of Faces . '' In 1976 , Salvador Dalí used Harmon 's image as the basis of his Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea and Lincoln in Dalivision .   
 Around 1973 , Harmon went to the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University , and became the head of that department . During this time , he conducted studies on facial recognition , as well as robotic control . He supervised one graduate student , Thomas F. Collura , who received his Ph.D. in 1978 for studying brainwave ( EEG ) signatures of attention in human subjects , using an analog computer . Harmon served in the department , having stepped down as head in 1976 to become professor , until his passing in 1982 .

 He was born in Kew, London. He had a relatively low family income until he moved to New College, Cambridge in 1910. During the World War I, he served with the 1st Battalion The Royal Artillery.  
 He joined the First World War Medical Corps in 1917. After the war, he served in France during World War II. During the Second World War, he worked as a biochemist at the National Health Service and the Food Research Laboratories at Aberdeen University.  
 In 1946 he moved back to London to take a seat at Westminster Hospital as a Privately-owned Physician.  
 He subsequently developed his hypothesis that inflammation could be used to diagnose and treat specific ailments. He showed that removing ( or even blocking ) an area of an inflamed tissue would improve the symptoms of cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis, arthralgia, and testicular cancer.  
 In 1951 Westley helped establish a Salpêtrière Research Institute in the UK. In 1978 he received the Pour le Mérite.

She wrote a number of books, many of which became best sellers in Sweden. Her speeches during and after World War II were frequently used in university courses and in government education. In 1977 she received the Nobel Prize in medicine `` for the development of a new basic science in biochemistry. ''  
 She was also an advocate of women's participation in science. She was invited to lecture in European universities in the 1980s. One of her notable lecture notes is an aphorism written in 1946 by her husband Carl, which suggests that `` all scientists are women '' : `` For the future of humanity, we have to understand how women coexist within the scientific community.

 = Otto Mendelssohn =  
Otto Mendelssohn ( 4 February 1769 – 7 August 1844 ) was a German professor of physics, who died in Dresden on 7 August 1844.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Mendelssohn was born at Frauenburg in the Oder Province ( today in the Magdeburg Region ). He studied physics at Berlin and was a member of the Freie Gesellschaft. In 1796 he obtained a doctorate ( also part of doctorates ) in philosophy, and in 1800 received a habilitation of philosophy from the University of Munich.  
 Mendelssohn worked for two years in Munich, teaching theology and geology to wealthy students, and in 1801 he returned to Germany and founded the Deutsche Physikalische Gymnasium. In Dresden he was succeeded by Johann-Werner Schumacher. On 16 May 1804 he became professor at the Freie Akademie der Wissenschaften ( Academy of Sciences ) at Dresden, and in 1818 was rector of the same institution.After teaching theology and geology in Dresden for 30 years, he moved to the University of Göttingen in 1823, and then in 1836 to the University of Marburg. In 1840 he emigrated to England.  
 Mendelssohn wrote :  
   
 `` Some critics, speaking of the history of astronomy and its relation to the modern discovery of the Earth, say that Mendelssohn was the first to discover the elliptical orbit of Venus, and that it had preceded Newton's special theory of light. I fully agree with this view ; I consider Mendelssohn to be the first to prove to the world that the relation of motion of Mercury to Venus, which was first observed by Copernicus, has, indeed, an inverse degree ; and that he has also demonstrated its intermediate position in relation to the known latitude of our planet at the time of his methodical proof.I wish to prove the hypothesis now commonly held that the differential equation for the Earth has a circular relation to the latitudes of the stars. I have shown, in general terms, that the problem of so-called binary phenomena, common to the whole Universe, is no longer a fundamental one ; the relations of time, shape, motion and the position of objects in the known Universe are no longer a fundamental ones ; and therefore I conclude that if we can furnish any data that may assist the natural scientists in applying our general principles, we shall be able to arrive at a far more definite conclusion.

 = A. K. Huntington =   
Professor Alfred Kirby Huntington ( 1852–1920 ) was a British professor of metallurgy and aviation pioneer . He flew balloons and made and flew his own aeroplane .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Alfred Kirby Huntington was born on 18 January 1852 in Ipswich , Suffolk to Francis Henry Huntington and Amelia Huntington ( née Hemsworth ) . He had an elder brother , Francis D ’ Esterre Huntington , who was born in 1847 but died aged 10 in 1857 .   
    
    
 == Professional life ==   
 Huntington was Professor of Metallurgy at King ’ s College , University of London .   
 He was trained at the Royal School of Mines under Dr. Percy , leaving it in 1877 as an Associate in Mining and Metallurgy , and proceeded to King 's College , London , where he assisted Professor W. N. Hartley in his researches on ultra-violet absorption spectra . He also assisted Sir William Siemens in his early experiments with the electric arc furnace . When a separate department of Metallurgy was founded at King 's College in 1879 , Huntington was appointed to the chair .   
 He died on 17 April 1920 at his London residence , Buckingham Street , Strand , shortly after relinquishing the chair.He was associated with the Institute of Metals from its foundation , and took an active part in its proceedings down to the time of his death . He became a Vice-President in 1910 , and during the session 1913-14 occupied the Presidential chair , being in office at the Ghent meeting , the first meeting of the Institute to be held abroad .   
 During the first world war Huntington was heavily involved with work for the War Ministry in testing munitions , including testing fracturing of grenades .   
    
    
 == Aeronautics ==   
 Professor Huntington was a founder and active committee member of the Royal Aero Club .   
 He began as a keen balloonist and took part in the first Aero Club race , which took place at Ranelagh Club on 7 July 1906 . His balloon Zenith was one of the seven balloons to ascend that day , the first time in England that seven balloons had ascended from one spot . He also competed in the first Gordon-Bennett Cup race in 1906 along with the Hon . C. S. Rolls.He moved on from balloons to build and fly his own aeroplane , to a design provided by J. W. Dunne . The Dunne-Huntington triplane was an unusual design , variously referred to as a triplane , a biplane or a tandem monoplane . Dunne produced the original design for Huntington during the winter of 1907–1908 . Huntington built it over the next two years and in April 1910 he flew it for the first time , on the Aero Club 's flying ground at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey . Huntington experimented with a number of improvements over the next few years , notably the substitution of a Gnome rotary engine , and it was still flying well into 1914 .   
 Due to the first world war , the aeroplane was dismantled and the framework used to make a rose pergola at the back of the professor 's country house in Yelstead.Huntington is named on the Aviation Memorial at Eastchurch .

Gretta Emilia Kemper ( German : [ ˈjɛmɑtɑ ˈɛtjaɐm ˈkɛːn ˈteːr ] ; 28 March 1829, Ulm – 25 July 1912, Hamburg ) was a German physician, author, feminist, and suffragist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Kemper was born in Ulm, where her father was Professor of Physiology. Kemper began her medical studies at the University of Münster in 1859, where she received her doctoral degree in 1860. Her work in Vienna led to her appointment as a lecturer in 1864, and she remained as a full professor of physiology until her retirement in 1890. In 1867, Kemper served as president of the German Congress of Physiocrats, a position she held until her death.  
   
   
 == Science and philosophy ==  
 Kemper believed that the development of man came from the collaboration of evolution and patriarchy. On the basis of this argument, Kemper opposed sex work, treating women as autonomous individuals. She rejected the majority view that children were truly autonomous. Kemper believed that society and women would eventually evolve in a `` new '' way, where women's voice could no longer be heard by her superiors, and by then, women would no longer be free individuals.She defined the rights of women as `` that they should get their due rights, not as a property of their person or of their race ''. However, Kemper acknowledged that women were excluded from certain professions such as medicine, and that their political rights should be respected.  
   
   
 == Published works ==  
 Kemper published several philosophical works, including his most important work ( 1875 ), Über die Einfluss des Allgemeinen, der Materialitäts- und Naturwissenschaft, an exposition of the human drive, calling attention to the social and economic consequences of its development. Kemper's main literary contribution was Der Erweiter. The work was written in German and published in six parts, initially in three volumes and later in 12. According to Kemper's personal daughter, Alice Müller, its primary goal was to show women, and not men, how life is to be lived. The book was compiled during Kemper's own studies.

 with N > 1 is when N = 24 and M = 70 . This is known as the cannonball problem , since it can be visualized as the problem of taking a square arrangement of cannonballs on the ground and building a square pyramid out of them . It was not until 1918 that a proof ( using elliptic functions ) was found for this remarkable fact , which has relevance to the bosonic string theory in 26 dimensions . More recently , elementary proofs have been published.He devised methods for testing the primality of numbers . In 1857 , at age 15 , Lucas began testing the primality of 2127 − 1 by hand , using Lucas sequences . In 1876 , after 19 years of testing , he finally proved that 2127 − 1 was prime ; this would remain the largest known Mersenne prime for three-quarters of a century . This may stand forever as the largest prime number proven by hand . Later Derrick Henry Lehmer refined Lucas 's primality tests and obtained the Lucas–Lehmer primality test .   
 He worked on the development of the umbral calculus .   
 Lucas was also interested in recreational mathematics . He found an elegant binary solution to the Baguenaudier puzzle . He also invented the Tower of Hanoi puzzle , which he marketed under the nickname N. Claus de Siam , an anagram of Lucas d'Amiens , and published for the first time a description of the Dots and Boxes game in 1889 .   
 Lucas died in unusual circumstances . At the banquet of the annual congress of the Association française pour l'avancement des sciences , a waiter dropped some crockery and a piece of broken plate cut Lucas on the cheek .

 Naff was born in Oak Brook, Illinois, into a prominent and wealthy, German-American family. He obtained his B.A. from Northwestern University, and a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1931. He worked as an associate professor at Michigan State University from 1934 to 1945. He then became director of the Institute of Protein Biology at the National Academy of Sciences from 1943 to 1946. He was director of Stanford University's Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics from 1946 to 1948. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1948, the year he was elected to a full term on the NAS.  
 In 1949, Naff was a National Research Council Research Fellow, where he led research efforts involving the study of the conformational and functional aspects of DNA. He also conducted a series of important studies on the structure and function of genes. His major contribution was the creation of a computational model of the large number of inducible steps necessary for DNA synthesis, a feat the researchers referred to as “ tying the knots ”. Together with fellow American, George Barnett, and I. P. Z-Huang, Naff developed a program, Aglar, which eventually contributed to the construction of a computer program called Multilocus Sequencer.Naff and Barnett published several publications between 1946 and 1956 and 1951 and 1955. During this time, Naff was also the first to make molecular modeling of protein complexes.Naff also designed a program which provided higher performance for basic and applied biology.

 = Tor Bergeron =   
Tor Bergeron ( 15 August 1891 – 13 June 1977 ) was a Swedish meteorologist who proposed a mechanism for the formation of precipitation in clouds . In the 1930s , Bergeron and W. Findeisen developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals . According to Bergeron , most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals , which then fall as snow , or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature . This process is known as the Bergeron Process , and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed .   
 Bergeron was one of the principal scientists in the Bergen School of Meteorology , which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather . While developing innovative methods of forecasting , the Bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth , growth , and decay . Bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process , which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone .   
 In 1949 he was awarded the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society .   
 In 1966 he was awarded the prestigious International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization .

 ; stating the famous Catalan 's conjecture , which was eventually proved in 2002 ; and , introducing the Catalan numbers to solve a combinatorial problem .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Catalan was born in Bruges ( now in Belgium , then under Dutch rule even though the Kingdom of the Netherlands had not yet been formally instituted ) , the only child of a French jeweller by the name of Joseph Catalan , in 1814 . In 1825 , he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at École Polytechnique , where he met Joseph Liouville ( 1833 ) . In December 1834 he was expelled along with most of the students in his year for political reasons ; he resumed his studies in January 1835 , graduated that summer , and went on to teach at Châlons-sur-Marne . Catalan came back to the École Polytechnique , and , with the help of Liouville , obtained his degree in mathematics in 1841 . He went on to Charlemagne College to teach descriptive geometry . Though he was politically active and strongly left-wing , leading him to participate in the 1848 Revolution , he had an animated career and also sat in the France 's Chamber of Deputies . Later , in 1849 , Catalan was visited at his home by the French Police , searching for illicit teaching material ; however , none was found .   
 The University of Liège appointed him chair of analysis in 1865 . In 1879 , still in Belgium , he became journal editor where he published as a foot note Paul-Jean Busschop 's theory after refusing it in 1873 - letting Busschop know that it was too empirical . In 1883 , he worked for the Belgian Academy of Science in the field of number theory . He died in Liège , Belgium where he had received a chair .

 = Eloise Gerry =   
Eloise Gerry ( January 12 , 1885 – 1970 ) was an influential research scientist whose early 20th century work contributed greatly to the study of southern pine trees and turpentine production . Gerry was the first woman appointed to the professional staff of the U.S. Forest Service at the Forest Products Laboratory , and one of the first women in the United States to specialize in forest products research .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Eloise Gerry was born January 12 , 1885 in Boston , Massachusetts . She received both bachelor 's and master 's degrees from Harvard University 's Radcliffe College , where she specialized in the anatomy of wood and trees and their physiological responses . She was first hired as a research scientist by the U.S. Forest Service in 1910 . On April 28 , 1914 she addressed the members of the Northern Hemlock and Hardwood Manufacturers Association , at the Forest products laboratory . Her address was titled `` The Structure of Wood and Some of its Properties and Uses . '' While working at the new Forest Products Laboratory ( FPL ) in Madison , Wisconsin , Gerry would also go on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1921 . Her dissertation , based on her research at the FPL , was titled `` Oleoresin Production : A Microscopic Study of the Effects Produced on Woody tissues of Southern Pines by Different Methods of Turpentining . ''   
 Gerry 's research in the area of southern pines and turpentining proved to be her most influential efforts . Working in Mississippi , Gerry performed pioneering work in microscopical studies of the anatomy of resin-yielding pines , and successfully developed methods to increase yield as well as prolong the working life of trees . She worked toward developing best methods stating , `` The microscope reveals many secrets concerning the activities of the tree in producing turpentine and gives these results more quickly than experimental methods alone . '' Based on her field-based research , Gerry was able to develop a program of `` More turpentine , less scar , better pine '' that many later attributed as a savior for the struggling industry .   
    
 During World War II , Gerry wrote FPL wartime publications on defects in wood used for trainer aircraft and gliders . After the war she worked in the area of research on foreign woods . Following 44 years with the U.S. Forest Service , Gerry retired in 1954 . Gerry died in 1970 at the age of 85 .

 = Eugeniusz Romer =   
Eugeniusz Mikołaj Romer ( 3 February 1871 in Lwów ( Lviv , Lemberg ) – 28 January 1954 ) was a distinguished Polish geographer , cartographer and geopolitician , whose maps and atlases are still highly valued by experts .   
 Born in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire , he graduated from a high school in Nowy Sącz and studied history , geology , geography and meteorology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków , also attending courses in Lwów and Halle ( Saale ) . In 1894 , Romer earned a doctorate in philosophy at Lwów University . He was a president of Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists ( 1910–11 ) .   
 In final years of the 19th century , he went to Vienna and Berlin to broaden his knowledge of glaciology , geology and meteorology . Romer also went to Lausanne , to study tectonics and morphology . In 1911 he became professor of Lwów University ( in 1946 also of Jagiellonian University ) , later he was named professor honoris causa at the universities in Lwów , Poznań and Kraków . In 1952 he became a member of Polish Academy of Sciences   
    
 In 1909 Romer went to Switzerland , to study Alpine glaciers . Next year , he traveled to Asia , and in 1913 to Alaska , to the Saint Elias Mountains ( where one of glaciers has been named after him ) . In 1916 , while in Vienna , Romer started work on the Great Statistical and Geographical Atlas of Poland . This atlas , published in Vienna in 1916 , was crucial to establishing borders of the Second Polish Republic . He was a member of the Polish delegation at the Paris Peace Conference , 1919 , helping to draw the western border of Poland . A second edition of his atlas was published in Lwów and Warsaw in 1921 .   
 In 1921 in Lwów Romer founded Cartigraphical Institute Ksiaznica-Atlas , which was moved to Wrocław after World War II . It still exists today . In 1929 he retired , concentrating his activities on the Institute . However , he kept close ties with Lwów 's Jan Kazimierz University , lecturing and examining .   
 In 1941 , when Lwów was captured by the Germans , he hid in a monastery at Piekarska Street , and this decision probably saved his life . Soon after , the Home Army decided to move him to Warsaw , from where he was to be transferred to England to work as an advisor of the Polish Government-in-Exile . However , doctors recommended that Romer should stay in the occupied country , as the journey was too risky for his weak health . Thus , he remained in Warsaw , using the false name Edmund Piotrowski . Romer survived the Warsaw Uprising and a camp in Pruszków .   
 After the war , he settled in Kraków , taking post of director of Department of Geography at the Jagiellonian University . Since 1899 , he had been married to Jadwiga Rossknecht , daughter of co-owner of the Okocim Brewery . They had two sons : Witold Romer ( 1900–1967 ) , professor of the Wrocław University of Technology and Edmund Romer ( 1904–1988 ) , professor of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice .   
 Eugeniusz Romer died 1954 in Kraków and was buried at the Salwator Cemetery .

 = Martha Hill =   
Martha Hill ( December 1 , 1900 – November 19 , 1995 ) was one of the most influential American dance instructors in history . She was the first Director of Dance at the Juilliard School , and held that position for almost 35 years .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Hill was born in East Palestine , Ohio . She attended the Battle Creek Normal School of Physical Education in Battle Creek , Michigan , graduating in 1920 . She took over the position of dance instructor , teaching ballet and Swedish gymnastics for the next three years . In 1923 , she was hired as dance instructor at Kansas State Teachers College . Hill taught there for three years , moving to New York City in 1926 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After arriving in New York , she studied with various dance teachers ; one of note was Martha Graham who would have a lasting impact on Hill . She was hired in 1927 as Assistant Professor of Dance at the University of Oregon where Bessie Schonberg was one of Hill 's student .   
 By 1929 , Hill had saved up enough money to move back to New York . She joined the Martha Graham Dance Company , completed a BS degree from Teachers College , Columbia University , and began teaching high school students at the Lincoln School of Teachers College . She was hired to teach at New York University in the Physical Education Department of the School of Education in 1930 , soon becoming Director of Dance . Hill reluctantly left the Martha Graham Dance Company in 1931 because of an increasing teaching schedule . In 1932 , Hill was hired by the brand new Bennington College in Bennington , VT , as Chairman of the Dance Department . She held the positions at NYU and Bennington College simultaneously until 1951 .   
 In the summer of 1934 , Hill initiated a summer dance festival on the Bennington College campus , named the `` Bennington School of the Dance '' , which ran until 1942 , with a brief interlude at Mills College in 1939 . Doris Humphrey , Martha Graham , Charles Weidman , and Hanya Holm were key faculty members .   
 Hill received her master 's degree from New York University in 1941 . In 1948 she formed a School of the Dance at Connecticut College calling it the `` Connecticut College School of the Dance '' . The new summer festival employed many of the same teachers/choreographers from the Bennington festival . Hill was a co-director of the festival until 1952 . The festival was later renamed the American Dance Festival and is currently housed at Duke University in North Carolina .   
 In 1951 , William Schuman , president of The Juilliard School , hired Hill to be the first Director of Dance . Schuman and Hill had the bold new concept of creating a training ground for dancers that would be equally split between ballet and modern dance .   
 Hill married Dr. Thurston Davies in 1952 . Davies died in 1961 .   
 Hill remained the director of dance at Juilliard until 1985 , training generations of dancers to the highest level of technique and artistry . Her students included Paul Taylor , Muriel Topaz , Pina Bausch , Daniel Lewis , Lar Lubovitch , Dennis Nahat , Linda Kent , Bruce Marks , Mercedes Ellington , H.T . Chen , Martha Clarke , Susan Marshall , Jenny Coogan , Robert Garland , Mark Haim , Henning Rübsam , Vernon Scott and Stanley Love . Hill was named Artistic Director Emeritus in 1985 , but continued to teach at Juilliard for several years .

Thomas Wright Blakiston ( 27 December 1832 – 15 October 1891 ) was an English explorer and naturalist .   
 Born in Lymington , Hampshire , Blakiston was the son of Major John Blakiston , second son of Sir Matthew Blakiston , 2nd Baronet ( see Blakiston baronets for earlier history of the family ) . His mother was Jane , daughter of Reverend Thomas Wright , Rector of Market Bosworth , Leicestershire . Blakiston explored western Canada with the Palliser Expedition between 1857 and 1859 . Mount Blakiston , the highest point in Waterton Lakes National Park was named for him in 1858 . In 1861 he traveled up the Yangtze River in China , going further than any Westerner before him . He spent the next part of his life in Japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country . He moved to the United States in 1885 . Blakiston died aged 58 of pneumonia in October 1891 while in San Diego , California and is buried in Greenlawn Cemetery , Columbus , Ohio .   
 Blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in Hokkaidō , Japan 's northern island , were related to northern Asian species , whereas those on Honshū to the south were related to those from southern Asia . The Tsugaru Strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary , and became known as `` Blakiston 's Line '' .   
 Blakiston collected an owl specimen in Hakodate , Japan in 1883 . This was later described by Henry Seebohm and named Blakiston 's fish owl .   
 Blakiston married Ann Mary in 1885 . She was the daughter of James Dun and the sister of Edwin Dun . They had one daughter and one son . Ann Mary survived him by 46 years and died in England in March 1937 .

Karl August Möbius ( 7 February 1825 in Eilenburg – 26 April 1908 in Berlin ) was a German zoologist who was a pioneer in the field of ecology and a former director of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Möbius was born in Eilenburg in Saxony . At the age of four he attended primary school at the Bergschule Eilenburg , and at the age of 12 he was sent by his father to train as a teacher . In 1844 he passed the exams with distinction and began working as teacher in Seesen , on the northwest edge of the Harz mountain range . In 1849 he began studying natural science and philosophy at Natural History Museum of Berlin . After he graduated , he taught zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , physics , and chemistry at the Johanneum High School in Hamburg .   
    
    
 == Oysters and ecology ==   
 In 1863 he opened the first German sea water aquarium , in Hamburg . In 1868 , shortly after passing his doctoral examination at the University of Halle , he was appointed Professor of Zoology at the University of Kiel and the director of the Zoological Museum . Marine animals were among his main research interests and his first comprehensive work on the fauna of the Kieler Bucht already emphasized ecological aspects ( Die Fauna der Kieler Bucht , co-authored by Heinrich Adolph Meyer , and published in two volumes in 1865 and 1872 , respectively ) .   
 Between 1868 and 1870 , Möbius was commissioned by the Ministry of Agricultural Affairs in Prussia to conduct research on the Bay of Kiel oyster beds . At the time , the oysters were being gathered from the natural beds and sold at expensive prices to the wealthy elite . Once the railroad was constructed and more opportunities for exportation arose , the demand for the oysters grew exponentially . In turn , the Ministry tasked Möbius with exploring the potential for further exploitation of the beds . Möbius 's research resulted in two landmark publications : Über Austern- und Miesmuschelzucht und Hebung derselben an der norddeutschen Küste ( 1870 , in English : On oyster and blue mussel farming in coastal areas of Northern Germany ) , and Die Auster und die Austernwirtschaft ( in English : Oyster and oyster farming ) , in which he concluded that oyster farming was not a realistic option for Northern Germany . More importantly , he was first to describe in detail the interactions between the different organisms in the ecosystem of the oyster bank , coining the term `` biocenose '' . This remains a key term in synecology ( community ecology ) .   
 In 1888 Möbius became the director of the Zoological Collections of the Natural History Museum of Berlin , and Professor of Systematic and Geographical Zoology at the Kaiser Wilhelm University , Berlin , where he taught until he retired in 1905 , at the age of 80 .

 Born in 1546 in Rodeaux, near Paris, Theodore de Broglie graduated from the École Polytechnique in 1576 and pursued a scientific career until his retirement in 1591. He travelled widely, visiting Japan, China, Korea and India. His interest in astronomy was inspired by William Flinders Petrie, and he corresponded with John Alexander Raffles and John Creighton Ross. He lived near Lycée Jardin at Père Lachaise and carried on discussions with the French astronomer François Guay.

 = Paul Kock =  
Paul Kock ( 14 December 1881 in Frönsvötn – 22 December 1960 ) was a Swedish chemist, mathematician and researcher, best known for discovering the Kock–Lehn law in 1932, a theorem of Kock and Ludvig Ulvaeus.Kock worked on a study of the chemistry of ozone, an important point of interest in the development of modern radiology. He studied helium and others in the field, and soon became a recognized authority on these elements.Kock taught mathematics at Pori University until 1930, when he became president of the university. Kock died in Stockholm, Sweden.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Paul Kock was born in Frönsvötn, County Stockholm, the son of Erich Kock ( 1821–1915 ) and Caroline-Bartolomé Perner ( 1850–1913 ). His sister Celine was named after him. In 1886, at age eighteen, he was hired to a research laboratory in Plönheim, where he worked as a research assistant under Jens Lehn, an influential chemist from Brandenburg, who introduced the Lehn–Kock law to Sweden. In 1888, Kock and Lehn published a seminal paper on a special category of benzoene. This became a standard method for studying the different types of benzoene from purebenzene. Kock and Lehn introduced the law, and the name now is to be found on some practical goods such as acids, stearic acid, butylene glycol, benzene glycol, butylene glycol-fumarate, acetylene glycol-amide, carnauba wax, castor oil, oil of xanthan gum and liquid rubber.  
 In 1899, after a contract with the university, Kock was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the newly established Karlsruhe University. Kock described his work on the structure of naphthalene, formed through polyvinyl dimethicone synthesis, in 1905, and introduced the law of Kock and Lehn ( the Kock coefficient ).  
 In 1912, he began to develop further his interest in chemistry and meteorology, but his schooling had not allowed him to fully pursue this interest until World War I. The Kock school in Karlsruhe taught mathematics and physical chemistry, and was originally meant to train future scientists. Although the school closed in 1923, Kock continued to hold meetings. In 1914, Kock published his initial findings, and received a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in Chemistry and Biology in 1919.  
 Kock was a major figure in the development of radar. His radar developments were a major stepping stone for all subsequent efforts to develop radiology.  
 Kock coined the Kock–Lehn theorem ( translation Kock–Lehn law ; see this article, though it may in fact refer to the law of Lehn and Kock ) and developed a theory of molecular structure. In 1937, he discovered a Kock-Lehn liquid crystal in which each crystal has an internal mirror surface. At the time of his death, Kock's liquid crystal was not known to be a new discovery, but only the first crystalline structure known. However, his fluid crystal was large and consisted of 93 layers of lattice, with 3×7-cm diameter of high refractive index and a solid crystal surface. In 1938, Kock was allowed to resume his work at the university, but at the time he was still the only non-scientist at the university in terms of `` basic research activities '' ( research subjects were all interrelated and included in the normal academic activity ).

Rene Soupe ( July 7, 1901 in Paris – December 9, 1979 ) was an important French psychologist who argued for the existence of a sound psychological base for understanding consciousness.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Soupe was born in Paris and studied at the Collège de France, the École Normale Supérieure, the Sorbonne, and the University of Paris, gaining his PhD at the Sorbonne in 1932, becoming Professor of Experimental Psychology in 1935 and Professor in 1938, while still professor. In 1957 he became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He became an enthusiastic advocate of Henri Poincaré's Theory of Visual Perception. In 1950 he defended Poincaré's thesis Vérité en physique, point ( `` On the structure of color '' ). Soupe had a strong impression of Nadeau, Hume, Leibniz, Ouspensky, Jung, Percival Lowell and Carl Gustav Jung.In 1961, Soupe and Frédéric Joliot-Curie jointly produced a preliminary work, Père et la vie psychique, which explained the potential for scientific progress in terms of psychology. These two collaborations—through Soupe's participation—were the foundation of an ongoing dialogue between French and American psychological researchers. In 1973, Soupe was awarded the Duchy of Neuchâtel's Albert-Dreyfus prize for honorary services to science, in memory of his teacher, and promoted to the position of Research Director in 1973. In 1973, the author of a paper on the'synthesis theory ', Soupe was awarded the Fondation pour la Méditation de la Societé de Psychologie ( FAP ) prize, for his later contributions to the fields of experimental psychology, psychophysics, and neuropsychology. He also won the C.M.G. Gillman medal for his contribution to genetics, and the Cajal laureate for his contributions to art, literature, and history.

 = Ursula Fleming =   
Ursula Fleming ( 1930 in Liverpool – 1992 in London ) was an English psychotherapist , Lay Dominican and author ; she was considered an expert in her field of work.Fleming was educated at Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries in south west Scotland . She began developing pain control techniques , as she wanted to be a concert pianist and wanted to control her nerves . Her attempts to find a cure for her unsteady hands led her to find a technique , which she used to treat thousands of patients , and led to her follow a career in alternative medicine . Her technique , known as the Fleming Method , relies on relaxed concentration to overcome pain . Ursula dreamed of opening a training center where she could pass on her knowledge to others but was unable to fulfill her goal due to dying of leukemia . She was married to English tennis player Jack Darkins.In 1987 , Ursuala Fleming was one of the co-founders of The Eckhart Society , a group that aims to promote the views of medieval theologian Meister Eckhart . The society website states :   
    
 The impact of Ursula ’ s work has been enormous . There is now a veritable industry of publications about Eckhart , both books and articles in scholarly journals . Eckhart is becoming ever more widely known . Dag Hammarskjöld , the former Secretary General of the United Nations always had Eckhart ’ s works by his bedside . The Meister Eckhart Gesellschaft was established in Germany in 2004 . Each year there are many doctoral theses published on Eckhart in different languages , and the constant demand for back issues of The Eckhart Review are proof if more were needed of Ursula ’ s success in helping to rehabilitate the Meister . Ursula ’ s book Grasping the Nettle ( 1990 ) has been translated into Russian and is now being translated into Czech .   
 Fleming wrote five books and featured in another , the most notable were two on pain control called Grasping the nettle : A positive approach to pain and Fleming Method of Relaxation for Concentration , Stress Management and Pain Control . They are designed to help health care professionals teach pain control techniques to patients .

According to Yevgeny Fedorov : `` Some years before, he had been engaged by the superintendent of this school, Mr. M. Vavilov, to introduce to the Russian Hebrew community an ambitious project for obtaining a high level of competence in the theoretical work of the Russian Jewish population. '' `` Fearing a ban of the educational and scientific literature by the government of the Russian Empire, Ivan Pavlov chose not to take up the program. `` After serving several stints in an engineer ’ s office in Samara, under the supervision of Joseph Prof. Ethelberger ( 1871-1921 ) he became a professor at the Physical University of Leningrad ( then a faculty of anatomy, and later department of physiology ). He was instrumental in the reestablishment of the Lenin Institute of Physiology and Physiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Leningrad ( 1953 ), where he remained until his retirement in 1962. His most notable students were Anatoly C3 A0minov and M. G. Bogatyrsky.

 = Giambattista Nolli =   
Giambattista Nolli ( or Giovanni Battista ) [ April 9 , 1701 – July 3 , 1756 ] , was an Italian architect and surveyor . He is best known for his ichnographic plan of Rome , the Pianta Grande di Roma which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748 , and now universally known as the Nolli Map . The map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measures 176 centimetres ( 69 in ) by 208 centimetres ( 82 in ) and was published in response to the commission of Pope Benedict XIV to survey Rome in order to help create demarcations for the 14 traditional rioni or districts . It was by far the most accurate description of Rome produced to date at a time when the architectural achievement of the Papacy was in full flower .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in 1701 in Castiglione d'Intelvi ( Como ) , he moved to Rome thanks to the patronage of members of the patrician Albani and Corsini families .   
 As an architect , he worked on the churches of Sant'Alessio on the Aventine Hill ( 1743 ) and Santa Dorotea in Trastevere ( 1751–1756 ) .   
    
    
 == Nolli Map ==   
 The Nolli map reflects Bufalini 's map of 1551 , with which Nolli readily invited comparison , however Nolli made a number of important innovations . Firstly , Nolli reorients the city from east ( which was conventional at the time ) to magnetic north , reflecting Nolli 's reliance on the compass to get a bearing on the city 's topography . Secondly , though he follows Bufalini in using a figure-ground representation of built space with blocks and building shaded in a dark poché , Nolli represents enclosed public spaces such as the colonnades in St. Peter 's Square and the Pantheon as open civic spaces . Finally , the map was a significant improvement in accuracy , even noting the asymmetry of the Spanish Steps . The map was used in government planning for the city of Rome until the 1970s ; it was used as a base map for all Roman mapping and planning up to that date .   
 The map is framed with a vedute by Stefano Pozzi . A scaled-down edition , a collaboration between Nolli and Giovanni Battista Piranesi , was published in the same year the original map was finished . Piranesi was instrumental in getting the work printed ; Giuseppe Vasi also contributed .

 = William Nicholson (chemist) =   
William Nicholson ( 13 December 1753 – 21 May 1815 ) was a renowned English chemist and writer on `` natural philosophy '' and chemistry , as well as a translator , journalist , publisher , scientist , inventor , patent agent and civil engineer .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Nicholson was educated in Yorkshire , and after leaving school , he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the British East India Company . His first ship was reportedly called the Boston and the second voyage was on board the Gatton .   
 Subsequently , having become acquainted with Josiah Wedgwood in 1775 , he moved to Amsterdam , where he made a living for a few years as Wedgwood 's agent .   
 On his return to England he was persuaded by Thomas Holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals , while also assisting Holcroft with some of his plays and novels . Meanwhile , he devoted himself to the preparation of An Introduction to Natural Philosophy , which was published in 1781 and was at once successful . A translation of Voltaire 's Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy soon followed , and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism .   
 In 1784 he was proposed by Josiah Wedgwood ( the current Chairman ) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain , and he was also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture , established in 1791 . He gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting , file-making , cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an areometer .   
    
    
 == Scientific work ==   
 On 12 December 1783 , Nicholson was elected to the `` Chapter Coffee House Philosophical Society '' . He was proposed by Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan and seconded by horologist John Whitehurst.Nicholson communicated to the Royal Society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects . In the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over Richard Kirwan 's essay on phlogiston , and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the French academicians ( Lavoisier , Monge , Berthollet , and Guyton de Morveau ) as ‘ An Essay on Phlogiston , to which are added Notes. ’ In 1797 he founded , published , and wrote part of the Journal of Natural Philosophy , Chemistry and the Arts , generally known as Nicholson 's Journal , the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in Great Britain . The journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs , by George Cayley in 1809-1810 . The publication continued until 1814 .   
 In 1799 he established a school in London 's Soho Square , where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry , with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from Thomas Pitt .   
 In May 1800 he with Anthony Carlisle discovered electrolysis , the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current . The two were then appointed to a chemical investigation committee of the new Royal Institution . But his own interests shortly turned elsewhere.Besides considerable contributions to the Philosophical Transactions , Nicholson wrote translations of Fourcroy 's Chemistry ( 1787 ) and Chaptal 's Chemistry ( 1788 ) , First Principles of Chemistry ( 1788 ) and a Chemical Dictionary ( 1795 ) ; he also edited the British Encyclopedia , or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences ( 6 vols. , London , 1809 ) .   
    
    
 == Later life ==   
 During the later years of his life , Nicholson 's attention was chiefly directed to water supply engineering at Portsmouth , at Gosport and in Hammersmith . William Nicholson died in Bloomsbury at the age of 61 on 21 May 1815 , attended by Sir Anthony Carlisle .

 = John F. Donatello =  
John Francis Donatello ( August 12, 1910 – January 17, 1995 ) was an American economist and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from Texas. He was a strong supporter of student loans, particularly for Ph.D. students, and was active in congressional oversight of higher education. He is considered a founder of the multi-party system of government.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 He was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to John Donatello and Erlis McClintock ( née Klein ). He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1938 from Iowa State University, earning a Master of Science degree in economics from Stanford University in 1943. He later earned a Ph.D. from Iowa State University. Donatello served in the US Navy, where he was a lieutenant commander in the Pacific during World War II, where he was caught up in the Pacific Campaign in San Francisco Bay. In 1943, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. He returned to Iowa State University to earn his Ph.D. in economics.  
 He returned to the United States to become the assistant director of economic analysis for the Under Secretary of the Navy's Bureau of Ships from 1952 to 1954. This post provided him with the opportunity to work closely with the then Secretary of State James A. Garfield on Navy policy issues, and it gave him the opportunity to compare wartime military strategy with wartime economic policies. He worked as a political adviser to Republican Congressmen of the era, and later served as the first Chief Economic Advisor to President Gerald Ford. Donatello's memoirs Are You Happy Here? became one of the most influential books of the 20th century, and was published in 1998.  
 In 1955, Donatello accepted a position as director of the Russell Sage Foundation, an institution funded by the American Research and Development Administration ( ARDA ), one of the federal agencies charged with scientific research. ARDA spent $ 500,000 a year on research and development at the time, and Donatello was tasked with supporting the project's administrative, technical, and fundraising priorities. He remained with the project until 1976.  
 After serving as a senior adviser to President Jimmy Carter, Donatello joined President George H. W. Bush's administration as assistant secretary of labor. During this time, he shifted gears and directed the Office of Personnel Management. He was the first director of the Office of Personnel Management and he remained there until 1986.  
   
   
 == Educational legacy ==  
 Donatello was instrumental in creating the federal Student Loan Forgiveness Program. The first installment, which funded students from 1982 to 1986, was the largest of its kind. Donatello founded and served on the federal commission on student loans that negotiated the President's 1980 plan to eliminate student loan interest rates. After the program was established, he spent the next several years developing the Financial Aid Compensation System ( FSA CS ) and working to expand the possibility of assisting students with loans. The president, in 1980, introduced the first federal student loan guarantee program as the Priede Permanente Plan. In 1990, he joined the board of trustees of the American Association of University Women, which he chaired until 2001.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 John F. Donatello died on January 17, 1995, at the age of 84 in Dallas, Texas, from prostate cancer. He was survived by his daughter Anne, his granddaughter Susan, and his three grandchildren. He was survived by his wife of more than a half-century, Ann Martin-Donatello.

 = Theodor Z C3 BCllendorf =  
Theodor Zöllendorf ( 28 September 1814, Kirch-Buch – 23 January 1882, Berlin ) was a German philosopher and professor of theology at the University of Berlin. His mother Elisabeth published him a biography and his brother Ferdinand was his son-in-law. He wrote an account of the chief beliefs of the ancient Catholic Church and served as Bishop of Trier.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Zöllendorf was born in Trier, Germany. In the year 1820, as the middle of the Civil War, he joined the University of Heidelberg. The first few years were extremely hard for him, especially as he was forced to miss his seminary classes and forges, while he struggled with debilitating case of tuberculosis. At the end of the war, however, he was able to obtain a liberal education in the University of Göttingen. He then went to Freiburg, and at the request of his uncle, the Archbishop of Freiburg, he received a public benefice of € 5,000 for three years, which enabled him to learn various languages.  
 In 1842, he became a professor of theology at the University of Berlin, but not the University of Freiburg. That university was located in the under-developed region of the German frontier, and so it had little scope for such a person. In the event, at the instigation of a friend ( whose name was not disclosed ), Zöllendorf obtained a medical doctorate from the University of Freiburg for 17 and a half years, and he entered upon a literary and other preoccupations.  
 During this period, he also devoted himself to the study of Catholicism in his school ( `` Des Herrnfassungs-Verbreitungschule '' ) of the University of Berlin. He was, however, an atheist, who, despite his training, could never understand the philosophy and the nature of Christianity. In 1846, after having long suspected the cause, he gave up all religious discussion. With the creation of the Protestant theologian Friedrich von Ruitzel, he resolved to profess another religion : with Ruitzel he took the thesis of the necessity of distinction, in which he fully rejected the belief in the equal unity of all things, and in which he explicitly and especially refuted the theory of God. In 1849, he formed a religious union with the Protestant preacher Ernst Müller, and became an honorary member of the `` Christus Arbeitenbarkeit '' ( movement for the strengthening of Christian morality ) at Berlin. During his many travels in the speaking countries he visited Persia and Mongolia.  
 In 1859 he was elected to a sub-ratio of membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Here he founded and conducted for twenty years the theological seminary. There he wrote almost four hundred sermons, which formed the basis of all later works of theologians such as Bernd Fränkel ( 1833–1882 ), Heinrich Hildebrandt ( 1833–1885 ), Johann Gottlieb Westermann ( 1833–1886 ), Julius Herrmann ( 1847–1927 ) and Robert Schwalbach ( 1867–1923 ).  
   
 In Berlin, and at St. Michael's church in Silesia, he wrote a voluminous, never-published autobiography, `` Professor Zöllendorf. `` In 1863 he gave his last lectures in Berlin, in the presence of the ministers of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the St. Peter's chapel.  
 He died in Berlin on 23 January 1882, having been 82 years of age.

 He died in Arcueil , France in 1820 , and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris .   
    
    
 == Science ==   
 In June 1783 , Blagden , then assistant to Henry Cavendish , visited Antoine Lavoisier in Paris and described how Cavendish had created water by burning `` inflammable air '' . Lavoisier 's dissatisfaction with the Cavendish 's `` dephlogistinization '' theory led him to the concept of a chemical reaction , which he reported to the Royal Academy of Sciences on 24 June 1783 , effectively founding modern chemistry . He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789.Blagden experimented on human ability to withstand high temperatures . In his report to the Royal Society in 1775 , he was first to recognise the role of perspiration in thermoregulation.Blagden 's experiments on how dissolved substances like salt affected the freezing point of water led to the discovery that the freezing point of a solution decreases in direct proportion to the concentration of the solution , now called Blagden 's Law .

Ilona Durigo ( 13 May 1881 – 25 December 1943 ) was a Hungarian classical contralto and an academic voice teacher . She appeared internationally , mostly in concert , singing Lieder and oratorios . She is known for singing Lieder that Othmar Schoeck composed for her , and is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of her era .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born in Budapest on 13 May 1881 , Durigo was a pupil of Bianca Malezcky and Julius Stockhausen . She studied from 1902 at the Vienna Conservatory with Philipp Forstén , then took further studies with Etelka Gerster and Eduard Bellwidt in Berlin.Each year from 1930 to 1939 she performed the alto part in Bach 's St. Matthew Passion with the Concertgebouw Orchestra , conducted by Willem Mengelberg . This included the first recording of the work in 1939 , alongside Karl Erb as the Evangelist and Willem Ravelli as the vox Christi . She performed as a soloist in more than 40 concerts with the choir Der Gemischte Chor Zürich between 1911 and 1943 . Singing also in musical centres of Austria , Germany , Belgium and Italy , she is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of the period.In 1912 , Durigo first performed with Othmar Schoeck , and in 1913 she entered his social circle and they became friends . Durigo fell in love with Schoeck , but her feelings were not returned , and in any event she was by then married to the Hungarian pianist Osman Kasics . Her relationship with Schoeck was at times turbulent , but Durigo soon became the best-known interpreter of his work , and in later life he stated that she was the finest singer of his songs he had found .   
 Her many collaborations with Schoeck included his settings of poems by Hesse . The reviewer of her recital in Bern on 23 March 1915 , with Schoeck as the pianist , in the Berner Tagblatt praised her differentiated expression of emotions and the accord with the pianist : `` Frau Durigo sang diese und alle anderen Lieder ( mit der Zugabe waren es 19 ) ... mit tiefster Empfindung . Ihr eigenes Erleben dieser Lieder äusserte sich nicht allein in den musikalischen Vortragsdifferenzierungen ( so wunderzart , poesieverklärte Töne , wie die ihres Kopfregisters , hörte man vorher von keiner Sängerin ) , sondern auch im zu- und abnehmenden Glanz ihrer Augen , dieses wahren Seelenspiegels . Und dass ihre Interpretation durchwegs das vom Komponisten Empfundene zutreffend erfasste , bewies die vollkommene Harmonie ihres herrlichen Gesanges mit Schoecks eigenartig schönem Klavierspiel . `` Frau Durigo sang these and all other songs ( with those added there were nineteen ) ... with the deepest sensitivity . Her own experience of the songs shone through , not only in the musical differences of enunciation ( such wonderfully fine , such poetry-transfigured tones of the head−voice were never heard before from any singer ) , but also in the sparkle of her eyes , the true mirror of the soul , as it came and went . And the perfect harmony between her splendid singing and the exceptionally beautiful piano playing of Schoeck showed that her interpretation throughout captured the intentions of the composer .   
    
 Durigo was a voice teacher at the Zurich Conservatory from 1921 to 1937 , where one of her students was Maria Stader . She was a friend of Hermann Hesse , the composer and conductor Fritz Brun , and the violinist Alphonse Brun.Durigo returned to Budapest in 1937 and taught at the Liszt Conservatory . She died on 25 December 1943 .

Ferdinand Schubert ( born 18 October 1794 in Vienna ; died 26 February 1859 ) was an Austrian composer and brother of Franz Schubert . He also designed the grave stone for the grave of Ludwig van Beethoven , which is now at Vienna 's Central Cemetery .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Ferdinand Lukas Schubert was an Austrian teacher , organist and composer . He is notable for his compositions and for his role in publishing the complete works of his younger brother Franz Schubert . He received training in piano and violin from his father , Franz Theodor Schubert , and his older brother Ignaz , later from Michael Wood , and finally from the public teacher of the choir of St. Anna , Joseph Drechsler . As a boy , Ferdinand played violin in the Schubert family string quartet , with his brothers Franz and Ignaz on viola and violin and his father on cello . Franz Schubert composed many of his early string quartets for this ensemble .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 In 1810 , Schubert became organist at the Lichtentaler Parish and was also assistant teacher at an orphanage in Vienna . Four years later , in 1816 , he was promoted to full-time teacher at the orphanage . In that year , Schubert married one of his students , Anna . In 1818 , Franz Schubert composed the German Requiem D621 for Ferdinand , which Ferdinand would later publish and for which he would take credit as his own composition.In 1820 , Schubert became a teacher and choirmaster in Altlerchenfeld . In 1824 , he received an appointment as teacher at the Normal-Hauptschule at St. Anna . After his first wife had died , Ferdinand married his second wife , Therese , in 1832 . His two marriages produced a total of 29 children , of whom 12 survived to adulthood . In 1838 , he became an honorary professor of organ at the Conservatory . Since he was admired in professional circles for his outstanding work as a school administrator , he received the post of director of the normal primary school at St. Anna in 1851 .

With the exception of certain operas , masses , and symphonies , he sold the bulk of Franz Schubert 's compositions to Anton Diabelli after Franz 's death in 1828 . Diabelli 's firm published the catalog over the course of the next 30 years , even after Diabelli 's death.Ferdinand also wrote numerous educational journals and a number of sacred compositions and smaller pieces for school use . Although he worked hard all his life , his family lived in poor economic conditions . So his will called for any work published after his death to be for the support of his dependents .

 = Jos C3 A9 Percival =  
José Julián Percival, Londres ( Spanish : [ ˈjoːɲɾat ˈtəpɛ̃bɛl ] ; 18 December 1841 – 23 May 1927 ), was a young Argentine Jesuit priest, politician and sociologist. His son was Cardinal Jorge Mario Percival.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Percival was born at Abadea in Sinaloa. He attended the Jesuit seminary of Quirigues, where he studied geology and sociology. Later he became a cardinal. He became the district chaplain of Azuay, capital of Perú province. In 1894 he became Vicar General of Quirigues, a post which he held until his death.  
 In 1900, Percival was elected a member of the Spanish Legislative Assembly for the province of Quirigues.  
 On 25 October 1913 he became one of the founding members of the central government of the Ecuadorian republic ( OAS ), and a member of the founding congress of the socialist student movement ( PSUC ) in the city of Quirigues ( of which he was first deputy president and in which he served as the editor ). He represented that province from 1911 to 1914 and in 1917 from 1918 to 1918 as well as from 1918 to 1918.  
 Percival died on 23 May 1927, the year of the state anniversary of the Imperial Spanish Republic ( SIFR ). He was a leading voice in the third national government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ).  
   
   
 == Writings ==  
 Percival's work largely focused on sociology and political economy and provided an intellectual and intellectual bridge for the later Argentine Revolution. He was the first to identify the emergence of a socialist society in Ecuador and during the next fifteen years, Percival and his fellow Jesuit Alejandro Laguna began working out the ideas of an economic socialist society.  
 He had a strong interest in public education as well as economic economics, and was also a political economist. In his inaugural address in Quirigues in 1897, Percival made the following statement :  
   
 From the perspective of social action, the spiritualists point out that there are two modes of economic activity. The first—the side of production which makes things, and uses them for human welfare—is for the specific class of the individual. The second—the side of production in which individuals rest their lives on the fruits of production, and produces goods to make themselves better off—in short, the economic self-realization of the individual—has to do with the social action of the multitude, as in the value-creators. At the present time, both methods—both ultimately universal and without controversy—have come to be referred to as the system of market relations, or what Algernon Sidney calls the universal social order. This order consists of a system of money for all the people, an order of production which has all of the characteristics of a universal social community—social intercourse for the individual, and of mutual assistance between individuals, so that in total the burden of production, what social intercourse is but a mere station to be removed, can now be divided among each individual.  
 Percival had a great influence in the late 20th century, with his doctoral student Lina Huber translating the works of Peirats. He was also involved in political economy during the time of Juan Perón and in the early part of the 1960s.

 = Aubrey E. Bala =  
Aubrey Edward Bala ( 1915–1996 ) was an American nuclear physicist and particle physicist. He was most known for his pioneering and influential work on cross-band magnetism in semiconductors. His influential ideas remain relevant to a large number of applications.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Aubrey Edward Bala was born in Philadelphia on August 25, 1915. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1927, and was a Fulbright scholar in the USA from 1932 to 1937. He then joined the Physics Department at the University of California, Berkeley in 1937 as Assistant Professor of Physics.  
   
   
 == Professional career ==  
 In the US, Bala took part in the United States Navy's development of radar, and joined the Los Alamos Laboratory as the Deputy Director in 1944. He then worked with the US Naval Research Laboratory on radar for many years, and in the 1950s became the laboratory's Associate Director, an important post for scientists.In the 1960s, Bala became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He remained in that position until 1982, and, in his final years, he directed the Institute for Optics, Optics and Quantum Theory at the University. He died in Berkeley, California, in 1996, and is buried in the UC Berkeley Aviation and Air Force Heritage Center, a quiet residential neighborhood.  
   
   
 == Life and legacy ==  
   
   
 === Critical work ===  
   
 Bala's fundamental research in theory and application of semiconductor cross-band magnetic momenta began in a paper, `` Electron Discharge with the Stereochronous Transistor '', which he presented to the American Physical Society in 1930. The paper, with colleagues J. B. A. Randall and R. E. Shackelford, anticipated later work by researchers such as Robert Stoup and Ernest Lindemann, establishing that the magnetic momenta of a semiconductor could be measured using time and distance variations of the electron path.  
 The early contributions of Aubrey E. Bala laid the groundwork for widely adopted cross-band magnetic momenta measurements, and a new field of research—electronic spectroscopy.  
   
   
 === Nobel Prize in physics ===  
   
 The University of California awarded Bala the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1962 for the discovery of the Wicker equation, which described the magnetisation of semiconductor surfaces by magnetic moments. The Nobel Laureate wrote, `` If you read the paper on its own, you will not find anything resembling a name. But remember, in the long term, it will have great significance to particle physics. '' The Nobel Prize was first presented on May 27, 1964, by Nobel laureate Arno Penzias.

Jacques Benoist ( 24 June 1852 – 1 August 1924 ) was a French pianist and composer, noted for his violin work, an early electronic keyboard.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
 Benoist was born in Paris. At the age of seven, he entered the Paris Conservatoire where he excelled in piano playing, clarinet playing, horn playing and saxophone playing. During his stay at the Conservatoire, he met violinist Cécile Pechman. When the young pianist quit his post in 1888 to return to school, Benoist was determined to emulate his pupil by studying on his own. The day after his 11th birthday, Benoist attended his first music class.  
 In 1889, he won first prize in the second national competition of the Conservatoire de Paris and, at age 17, was elected its professor. Benoist became professor of harmony and composition at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1892 and in 1894 appointed him its rector and conservator. In 1893 he made his début with a concerto for viola, timpani and piano.  
 In 1895 Benoist also became first viola master of the Paris Opera. He remained there until 1899, and also conserved for the 1912-14 season at the Grand Palais, in Paris.  
 The success of the new choral works inspired Benoist to undertake works for solo and choral concerts, and in 1897 he returned to the Paris Conservatoire where he directed its violin department. He also became the Conservator for clarinet.In 1902 Benoist was appointed to the chair of string trio. In 1904 he published the work Op. 18, with its Trio, Nocturne, and Fugue. It is a symphony-like movement that begins with the melody of The Star Spangled Banner, marches on to scenes of the French Revolution, before culminating with a patriotic duet. As with the other works of this series, Op. 18 is based on some classical pieces, and contained a book-length score, the so-called `` Piguet ''.  
 In 1910 Benoist served as the acting president of the Société Royale d'Orléans, becoming President to the end of the war. In 1913 he was named one of the 100 most influential composers of the 20th century by the French Academy of Arts.  
 Benoist died in Paris and was buried at Lourdes cemetery.

 Liebenstein was born in Hamburg to Roman-Lutheran parents ; his father was a founder of the Protestant Church. He studied theology at Hamburg and Strasbourg, graduating with a doctorate in 1876. In 1878, he was ordained to the priesthood as a lay priest, and, two years later, served as one of the first theological professors of the town of Kappackstanz, South Württemberg. In 1883 he was appointed minister at Abshan-Schlotenshausen, South Tyrol, while preparing for the ministry at Kappackstanz and working for one year as professor of Old Testament and New Testament. In 1885, after reforming the theological curriculum of the parish school in Kappackstanz and reorganizing the Missionary Society, he was elected pastor of Kappackstanz. He was named lecturer in theology at the Main Wald- und Konstanz Evangelischer Mission and professor of Theology and Missionary Work at the Christian Hospital for Sick Children ( founded in 1900 ), founded by Henry Owen in 1882. When W. A. Kantor replaced Dietrich Bernhard Siegert as pastor of Abshan-Schlotenshausen, the Seventh-day Adventist congregation there protested, and the movement led to Kantor's resignation. Liebenstein was a co-founder of the National Academy of Protestant Theology.  
 Liebenstein is noted for the Revised Revised Theology of the New Testament and for the German translations of the Epistles of St Paul and St John and the Epistles of Paul and St Paul, to which he added many new translations.

 = James Laycock, 2nd Baron Laycock =  
Sir James Laycock ( 13 March 1809 – 18 March 1892 ) was a British politician, civil servant and biographer who served as the House of Commons Speaker between 1877 and 1882.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Laycock was born in St John's Hall, London, to John Laycock, an industrialist who became Mayor of Bath, and his wife, Mary Haydon, daughter of John Haydon and Sir James Minnie. His father, Sir J. Laycock, was in the course of advocating the establishment of schools, and in 1839, having secured from Bishop Ferdinand Day his support for that purpose, laid the foundation of a new Independent Cathedral School, a gift from the first Lord of St John. Laycock was educated at the Cornhill School, Basingstoke, and at The Royal Military College, Woolwich.He joined the Conservatives, but not until 1864 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was so influential that Lord Rennard became aware of the sudden change of his position. At a private dinner in 1867 he co-sponsored an article entitled `` The Government's War '', of which, as a member, he was also a member of the Royal Society. In 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and of the Economic Association of Great Britain. He then served as a Government advisor until 1881, when he was forced out of office by the changes of 1881. The Year of the Sheep was his last official act.  
   
   
 == Social views ==  
 Laycock, along with his successor Lord Richards, was in favour of introducing a constitution that would extend the franchise to its essential features, without restricting it to male suffrage and education ; and a government or a parliament should be free to legislate as to civil, ecclesiastical and commercial matters. On the other hand, he was a `` Socialist '', and in 1864, as successor to Lord Lusby, he wrote the motion of the House of Lords which made it compulsory for the House of Commons to investigate issues relating to industrial production, a duty which was to be a privilege of Parliament.  
   
   
 == Politics ==  
 Laycock was for the Reconstruction of the Post-War Parliament after the Civil War. He regarded it as incumbent on him to introduce reforms in the war effort and to urge them in Parliament. He was at first enthusiastic about making improvements in the relations between the army and the navy, but at a conference of his Conservative colleagues, he sharply criticised them for their utter indifference to the services that the navy rendered to Britain, and particularly the navy's great contribution to the strength and capability of the air fleet. Nevertheless, his intervention in 1881 marked the end of his career.

 = Hugo Grotz =  
Hugo Grotz ( German : [ hɛɛ ] ; 9 March 1891 – 24 November 1975 ) was a German-born American violinist and composer. He is most notable for the composition of the opera Gipsy Danger in tenor and piano.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hugo Grotz was born on 9 March 1891 in Munich to Anton Grotz, a retired baritone of the Teutonic Order, and Sophie Czemka. He studied violin at the Leipzig Conservatory and at the Berlin-based Max Vogel Conservatory where his father, also a violinist, worked under Paul Hindemith.  
 In 1909, Grotz was commissioned by the Russian Empire as a violinist for the Hetalia Opera in Saint Petersburg. He was the master cellist for the inaugural opera. He performed that premiere in a modified version of the Hungarian folk song style which was first performed in Istanbul in 1913. The opera was one of the first successes of G. Usserviz. As a violinist, Grotz composed and performed his own scores, especially the multi-movement Gipsy Danger ( 1927 ), performed at the 1936 World's Fair in Washington, DC. The score was originally composed for two pianos, but Grotz had to substitute these two instruments for the two traditional concert-game pianos to accommodate an increased audience size. His version of Gipsy Danger had some parallels with that of Chopin and Liszt, but was also distinctly unique in how he developed the music to the choral techniques of Mazurkas, Polka and Rachmaninoff. It is significant that Grotz was instrumental in writing the text for this work, which was written by Hermann Heyde and Ernst Gerhard Herzog and premiered by Wilhelm Stein ( conductor of the Bach and Rachmaninoff Hall orchestra, 1910–11 ).  
 In 1927, Grotz joined the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra ( now known as the Kreisau Circle ), a highly trained professional orchestra which also included Liszt, Chopin, Schumann, and Debussy. From 1927 to 1933 Grotz was a professor at the Juilliard School, but he never returned to teaching there. Grotz retired from the Prague Philharmonic in 1934. He married Rebecca Cohn ( 1889–1990 ) in 1933 and they had three children, Hector ( who would go on to become a noted classical pianist ), Hanna, and Patricia ( born 1955 ).In the late 1940s, Grotz turned to violin-making as a career and joined the Offenbach-La Mer for the large-scale work Nacht der Fliegende ( 1936 ). In the late 1950s and 1960s, he also composed works for organ and chamber music. Among his larger-scale works was the opera Circus Bleu ( 1960 ) in which he played an unnamed character in the role of the inimitable Madame Bovary. From 1955, Grotz also appeared on many radio programs promoting the work of Josef Kosminsky and other great Austrian composers.  
 Grotz served as a viola soloist in the cantata Les Musketeers du bassin et la guerre ( 1950 ) and the orchestral pieces Andante for piano ( 1961 ) and Le musique ( 1962 ). He also composed cello sonatas ( String Quartet ), which were largely for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and conducted Schubert and Liszt recitals. His choirsman has been noted as having a particular talent for arranging the minuets of Mozart. A book was published in 1968 called Lo professeur Grotz : his Art of Strings which details his day to day practice of orchestral playing. In 1971 he retired from the violin making profession. He also continued to write as a composer and was a staff member for the Minnesota Orchestra.  
 Grotz died in Minneapolis on 24 November 1975 at age 83.

 == Biography ==  
 He was born on January 11, 1899 in Crellecú, Spanish province of Montserrat. Arrighi graduated from the Technical University of Amsterdam in 1911 and from the University of Leiden in 1912. He obtained his PhD in zoology under the direction of E. A. Pleeker.  
 After completing his doctorate, he started working in the Department of Anatomy and later in the Department of Geology of the University of Leiden.  
 In 1923 he went to Ceylon and a few years later to Gabon as a public health officer and in 1928 to India.  
 In 1948 Arrighi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the theory of the paragamete hormone receptor and for the determination of a normal stem cell type.  
 A telegram by Arrighi received after his death was :  
   
 That eon there beseems I never again had so much to learn. Never forget how my colleagues working at the Faculté de Biologie reported back on that day in '98, on the discovery of the phosphatidylinositol 3,5-diamidino-4-hydroxypyrimidine ( phosphatidylinositol 4-O-acetate ) cell, described me as only the first to bring this discovery into view.  
.  
   
 == Research ==  
 Arrighi's research focused on the paragamete hormone receptor ( PIR ).  
 It is believed that the PIR influences action of gonadotropin, and has a direct effect on sexual development.  
 Arrighi is the first to show that circadian rhythms of adrenal secretion are important in the regulation of sexual differentiation.  
 In 1929, Arrighi published a study on the detection of psychotropic steroids produced in a sexually mature mouse when injected with an apocrine hormone.  
 He also studied the effects of sex hormones on the neuroendocrine system of human reproductive organs.

 == Selected publications ==  
 As a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, Skovron studied with Niels Bohr, namely about the structure of the radiation oscillations of atoms and their strong interaction. During this time, Skovron also was an observer of his intense discussions with Ludwig Boltzmann and Hermann Pauli, as well as by W. Stanley Ritter, who was the very first person to experimentally measure the Bose–Einstein constant, a constant of special interest in quantum mechanics. Ritter and Skovron published a paper on this phenomenon in 1932.  
 During the 1930s Skovron worked at Columbia University as a physics and mathematics lecturer. In 1954, he moved to Berkeley, which granted him full academic freedom for the remainder of his career.  
 In 1970, Skovron became a professor emeritus at Howard University, which bestowed upon him an honorary degree in 1976.

He was a student of the Åbo University and moved to Stockholm where he became a private teacher and a secretary . Through his work as a writer for the Freemasons he came in to contact with Elis Schröderheim , who introduced him to King Gustav III of Sweden .   
 Gustaf Björnram claimed to be able to communicate with the spirits of the dead and arranged well-attended séances frequented by the king and Prince Charles , during which he allegedly forwarded predictions about the future from the dead . For a couple of years around 1780 , he was an immensely fashionable medium in Stockholm , was inducted into the Freemasons and given a Sinecure by the monarch . He once performed a séance in the church of Lovö , where he called upon the spirit of Adolf Frederick , King of Sweden in the presence of the king and a circle of his favorites , among them Adolf Fredrik Munck , where the father of the king appeared as a mask behind a curtain of smoke in the dark church .   
 However , when his prediction about the death of the king 's mother , which was eagerly awaited by the king , did not materialize , and the royal physician Sven Anders Hedin exposed him as a fraud by describing how he had witnessed his preparations for the so-called seance in the Lovö church , he lost his favor with the king , who gave him a pension and dismissed him from court . He was replaced by Henrik Gustaf Ulfvenklou .

 = Louis Lalande =  
Louis Lalande ( French : [ lɑʃyʃ ] ; 13 November 1832 – 17 March 1915 ) was a French lawyer and writer.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Louis Lalande was born in Montreuil and worked as a civil servant. He studied law at the Sorbonne. In the late 1830s and 1840s he was a lecturer of philosophy at the Sorbonne, and in 1843, as a legal chaplain of the Imperial Legion, he became director of a literary mission to Madagascar.  
 His literary missions came under the influence of a conviction of Mazarine Minot, who encouraged him to introduce a particular method of composing ethical poems which would express their characters in an `` enchanting graphic form ''.Louis Lalande died at the age of 69, while on a horse ride. The poor state of his health has been a source of difficulty in his biographies.Several of his writings are held by the Université Paul Eudes, and, despite their status as historical documents, he was sometimes accused of plagiarism. He was succeeded as President of the Pontifical Roman Catholic Church in 1873, after his death.

 = Ælle Harlandhund =  
Ælle Harlandhund ( November 12, 1897 – October 12, 1974 ) was a Danish geneticist and bacteriologist. In particular, he is known for his studies of the roots of typhus in both humans and nonhuman animals. Harlandhund is regarded as the father of modern research in the study of typhus.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Harlandhund was born in Copenhagen in 1897. In 1903 he began his studies at the University of Copenhagen at a time when textbooks concerning bacteriology were scarce. At the age of 23, he became the leader of a group of scientists who made a number of discoveries that were incorporated into the emerging field of microbiology in Copenhagen.  
 His research included the establishment of a typhoid susceptibility test on a castrated patient, discovering the origin of syphilis in mice, and the production of a type of rifless virus for test-producing mosquitoes. Later, he worked on breeding typhus virus in a carrier form into a rickettsial ( or virulence-forming ) vector organism. He produced and showed that the paralytic form, typhus typhimurium, had a much shorter life span than the live form. He also wrote a paper on the development of typhoid vaccines in 1917 and many other papers and textbooks on bacteriology.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At the turn of the 20th century, typhus fever had become a leading cause of death in the British Isles, and an epidemic epidemic was rampant. Harlandhund's early work led him to the opinion that the malarial and sclerotinoid-tolerant mosquito probably produced its infection via the bite of an infected mosquito. Although he subsequently supported an association of the bite of a Malay Asian mosquito with typhus, his own research of disease transmission suggests the possibility that the disease arises from contact with a host's blood cells from another species. His research of the plasmodium parasites from what he called `` mothers '', proved important in elucidating the source of the disease, and found that women from Asia, predominantly China, brought the disease with them to Denmark.  
 He is most notable for his work in typhus that has been dedicated to the discovery of a vaccine that is less likely to cause disease to infected humans. His research was instrumental in the development of vaccine treatments for Typhus A, in which anti-siphon life-suppresses agents and antisera for typhus.  
 He has also worked to confirm the identity of the human form of Streptococcus mutans for a strain of streptococcal bacteria.  
 The medical name for this bacterium, Edemyscus mutans, in the genus Bubo, is named after him.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 Harlandhund was a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog ( BD ). He received many honors, including the Carl Emden medal, the Golden Jubilee Medal of the Royal Danish Society of Medicine, and the Order of the Dannebrog.

He is best known for his study of sexual differentiation, phallometry, and sexuality in insects.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Meinertzhagen was born in Kronstadt, where his father was a prominent priest. While still in school, he obtained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Medicine and his interest in anatomy was sparked by taking an anatomy exam with von Hamilcher. Meinertzhagen is best known for the work on female reproductive organs that he published in a series of letters and in three popular scientific papers during the early 1840s. Meinertzhagen made numerous contributions to the field, as well as revealing some biological principles that were ignored in the area of classification and physiology. He later went on to study medicine in the United States.  
 Meinertzhagen married the journalist Augusta Mutter, daughter of a hospital administrator, in Berlin in 1833. He died in the United States in 1862.

Ernst Ludwig Leitersberger ( May 5, 1854 – June 14, 1926 ) was a German physicist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Leitersberger studied mathematics at the University of Heidelberg and at the University of Vienna, where he obtained his doctorate in 1901. From 1901 to 1903 he worked as an assistant to Martin-Löscher. He became a professor at Heidelberg in 1905, and remained there until his retirement in 1921.  
 Leitersberger is credited with inventing a type of vacuum chamber for medical research. His method of artificially increasing the efficiency of chemical reaction chambers by generating a positive vacuum does not take into account the mass spectra of different components, thereby eliminating the effects of the radiation from outside the chamber. His vacuum chamber is still used by some schools in the United States and by some institutions in Europe.

Gottlob Johann Max Kaufmann ( July 22, 1863 in Dresden – December 11, 1943 in New York ) was a German chemist, physicist, palaeontologist, and mycologist. Kaufmann is known for his pioneering work on the origin of plants and fossils. His earliest work was in the field of biogeography, using his expertise in cave stratigraphy, in succession with his work on the evolution of the species, for example the Xenopsypha icierva. From 1884 to 1891 he was the first Head of the Section of Paleontology at the Deutsche Entomologischen Gesellschaft in Dresden, where he led research on the Cambrian sequences and articulated the fossils of the Cambrian plants. From 1902 to 1904 he was Head of the Section of Paleontology at the Vienna Academy of Sciences, and from 1906 to 1913 he was director of the new division of paleontology in Dresden ( now the Munich Academy of Sciences ). In addition to his work in the Sudetenland and in the area around Germania, he also played a role in rediscovery of the Rennenfels islands of the Baltic, which included Svalbard, and in the creation of the world's largest lake, Lünefel, a lake in the Barents Sea, located in his native Germany.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1907 Kaufmann received his PhD from the University of Berlin, with a thesis on the bones of modern antelopes. In 1911 he began a joint study with Adolf Heinrich Zürcher and Marietta Richter in Holstein, where he took a special interest in cave stratigraphy and this laid the basis for his interest in mycology, for which he had been closely mentored by Hans von Auernheimer. On returning to Dresden after graduation, Kaufmann returned to the Nazis to help promote the Hochschule für Paläontologie ( Geological Institute of the Sciences ) in coordination with Karl Wilhelm Kaas, who was leading a worldwide expedition to help create a new system of geomorphological data, giving it a new name in that name. In addition, he founded the Batavian Institute of Paleontology, a close associate of Kaufmann's own institute and vice-director of its geology section.

 = James Leske =  
James Leske ( September 30, 1885 – February 7, 1943 ) was a Norwegian paleontologist and professor at St. Petersburg University who took part in the first geological investigations of East Greenland.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Leske was born in Bergslagen. At the age of seven, he joined the Norwegian school of theology, and after going to Eesti ( `` Antarctica '' in German ), he took his vows of the Order of St. Olav on 1 September 1907.  
   
 After finishing his theological studies at Eesti, he obtained a job as a librarian for a post office in Norrköping.On 10 August 1914, Leske joined the Norwegian Expedition to Greenland, which made a general exploration of the interior. The expedition carried out digs in the Karst Plain and an archaeological excavations in Broken Bay. Leske would later describe the conclusions reached as being preliminary, i.e. that the important group of deposits which lie in Broken Bay were hitherto entirely unexplored, but that from some point of further exploration the bodies of prehistoric whales could be discovered. There was no good evidence in the field, and Leske did not suggest that any material should be found for comparison purposes.Upon the outbreak of World War I, Leske worked in a despatched detachment at Baffin Bay, where, along with two assistants, he undertook geological work, constructing a volume map of the coastline of Greenland.Leske was demobilised as a result of the conflict, and came back to Oslo in October 1919. He became a professor at the University of Oslo. He was on the Board of Governors of the Institute of Geology and chairman of the Norwegian Committee of Paleontology.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 While a professor at the University of Oslo, Leske joined the staff of the geological survey of the island of Hedeby. Between 1918 and 1922, he worked on an expedition to check the completeness of a map of East Greenland which the Royal Norwegian Academy of Sciences presented to the Government of Norway in February 1922.Leske served as the Expedition's first scientific representative in Greenland.On 19 January 1928, Leske was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of Denmark, and became a member in 1934.  
 His most notable scientific work was on fossil fishes. As he had received his Ph.D. in the University of Tübingen, he was able to study the fishes of the Gulf of Corse, which had then been a local area of scientific interest. According to Prof. F. Gundersen : `` We then began to go to Italy, and under Lemleana Parhake we began two expeditions to tell more generally the fishes of the Sandwich Islands. ``  
   
 Leske died in Oslo.

Benjamin Gompertz ( 5 March 1779 – 14 July 1865 ) was a British self-educated mathematician and actuary , who became a Fellow of the Royal Society . Gompertz is now best known for his Gompertz law of mortality , a demographic model published in 1825 .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Of the German Jewish family of Gompertz of Emmerich , he was born in London , where his father and grandfather had been successful diamond merchants . Debarred , as a Jew , from a university education , he studied on his own from an early age , in the writings of Isaac Newton , Colin Maclaurin , and William Emerson . From 1798 he was a prominent contributor to the Gentleman 's Mathematical Companion , and for a period won the annual prizes in the magazine for the solutions of problems.In line with his father 's wishes , he entered the London Stock Exchange . He became a member of the Mathematical Society of Spitalfields , and served as its president when it was merged with the Astronomical Society of London . In 1819 he was elected a F.R.S. , and in 1832 became a member of the council . The Astronomical Society was founded in 1820 , and he was elected a member of the council in 1821.On the death of his only son he retired from the Stock Exchange , and absorbed himself in mathematics . When the Guardian Insurance Office was established in 1821 , he was a candidate for the actuaryship , but the directors objected to him on the grounds that he was a Jew . His brother-in-law Sir Moses Montefiore with his relative Nathan Mayer Rothschild then founded the Alliance Assurance Company ( 1824 ) , and Gompertz was appointed actuary under the deed of settlement . His management of the Alliance Company was successful , he was consulted by government , and made computations for the Army medical board.In 1848 he retired from active work and returned to his scientific labours . He was a member of many learned societies , and was also one of the promoters of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge . Of the leading Jewish charities he was a prominent member , and he worked out a plan of poor relief ( Jewish Chronicle , 6 October 1845 ) , which was afterwards adopted by the Jewish board of guardians.Gompertz died from a paralytic seizure on 14 July 1865 .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
    
 MathematicsFrom 1806 he was a frequent contributor to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ; but his early tracts on complex numbers and porisms ( 1817–18 ) were self-published . Gompertz was an old-fashioned Newtonian who retained and defended the notation of fluxions .   
 AstronomyFor ten years he actively participated in the work of the Astronomical Society , contributing papers on the theory of astronomical instruments , the aberration of light , the differential sextant , and the convertible pendulum . With Francis Baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars ; the work was left uncompleted , because of the publication of the Fundamenta Astronomiæ of Friedrich Bessel . Their efforts , however , led to the complete catalogue of stars of the Royal Astronomical Society .   
 The Gompertz modelHe worked out a new series of tables of mortality for the Royal Society , and these suggested to him in 1825 his law of human mortality , which he first expounded in a letter to Francis Baily . The law rests on an a priori assumption that a person 's resistance to death decreases as his years increase . The model can be written in this way :

He was educated at the seminary and the theological faculty at the university of Erlangen and the theology faculty at the University of Königsberg. In 1832 he was appointed professor of Theology at the University of Göttingen, where he remained for some ten years. At Erlangen he engaged himself with the doctrinal and historical studies of Paul Tillich, teaching one-to-one as early as 1834. In 1841 he was made professor of theology at Königsberg and under the direction of Alexander Blaustein was appointed to teach theology at the University of Heidelberg, and soon afterwards, in 1845, professor of theology at the University of Freiburg. He was given the chair of theology by the Schule der Universität Heidelberg, was elected a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Berlin, and an honorary member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina. From 1867 he lived in Dresden. Among his works were The Righteousness of the Church : Its Character, Duty, and Benefits ( 1860 ) ; Die Biblische Theologie, ( 1867–1877 ) ; Das neue Frau zur Juden ( with Josef Marcak, 1873 ), a tractical in defense of the Catholic priesthood ; God's Guard Against Evil ( 1878 ) ; Aida : a prayer book in the tradition of the ancient Hermetic language ; and his book Praepositio.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 In the summer of 1835, he published Lehrbuch des theologischen Rundschriften ( `` The Law of the Real Presence of God in the Worshipful and Worshipful Elected Teachers, under the Rightful Ministry of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit '' ), the first of two sermons which he preached in the Christian Pentecostal assemblies of Dresden. He was married in 1846 and had two sons and one daughter. During his lifetime Freyke was also engaged in theological studies and investigation of the Old Testament ; his investigations were the result of a long search for documents and sources of the tradition of the Old Testament. His eight papers in the Preface to his volume contain the `` first comprehensive investigation '' into the spirit of Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy ; but he also later made use of material from the proverbs of the Hebrews and the book of Psalms.

 = Charles Lytton Spearman =  
Charles Lytton Spearman ( December 2, 1867 – May 7, 1953 ) was an American ornithologist and writer. He is best known for his work on the genetics of avian flight, which he described as `` even more clever than von Neumann, without the anarchist streak of either, '' and for coining the epithet `` coleopterous '' for the blind eagle.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Spearman was born on December 2, 1867, on Staten Island, New York. He was the son of Henry Hudson Spearman, a Washington State lawyer and commissioner in the Chinese War. His older brother, Charles James Spearman, who enlisted in the United States Army, later became a distinguished air force officer.  
 He was educated at the Columbia Military Academy, graduated from the University of Washington in 1881, and studied under V. P. Snow in the laboratory of Donald W. Weaver, at the University of California, Berkeley, and Owen D. Tillotson, at the University of Washington. After a year, he became a junior research assistant to James M. Gilkey. In 1886, he married Mary Jayne Thomson.  
   
   
 == General Biological Laboratory ==  
 Spearman began working for the Stanford Experimental Station, in the fall of 1892. He was promoted to a supervising member of the laboratory in 1894, and served as director of the Laboratory until 1907, when he was dismissed by the director as a failure, and replaced by Walter M. Meylan. In 1902, he returned to the University of Washington. From 1904 to 1906, he served as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Charles Darwin, one of the pioneers of evolutionary biology. He was granted a professorship in biology in 1910.In 1909, Spearman and Darwin began a long association, which was to last through to their deaths. Darwin referred to Spearman as his `` most scientific secretary. '' In a letter to his cousin Ernest Thompson, he wrote, `` If it were impossible for you to be the true source of all my ideas in biology, I should at once come to live with you as my `` closest friend. '' Darwin noted that Spearman made `` regular trips to our apartment on Franklin Avenue to attend lectures at Berkeley. ''  
   
   
 == Birdwatching and writing ==  
 Spearman had many interests. He devoted the final part of his professional life to research on the genetics of birds. In his bird-gland study, he described the `` first real avian flight '', `` Lateral dispersal '' and `` mitosis of a common wing feather... among the Turkey legate, a type of mule-pigeon ''. One of the eponymous species is also named in his honor.He published A review of birds of the Triassic ( Smithsonian Institution Series ) in 1909, and in 1913, `` Ransome's Birds of the Quaternary '', a popular work that included descriptions of 18 new species, 6 new subspecies, and some 36 new subspecies. He also wrote Birds of Paradise, including with W.H. Ritchie the letter `` E '' on the cover.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 Spearman's scientific work was at times wide-ranging, as exemplified by his biography of Otto von Bohlen, a well-known academic and German naturalist, that was published in 1937 in Sweden, the German-speaking world. He became a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1932.  
 Spearman died on May 7, 1953 in Seattle, Washington, from bronchial pneumonia.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Spearman was married twice, in 1884 to Ann Mabel Weems, and had three children : brother Charles Kirt, Edward Austin `` Bo '' Spearman ( d. 1944 ), and his wife, Ann Searcy Burris, née Duvernoy.

 = Wilhelm Fraenkel =  
Wilhelm Fraenkel ( 1881–1963 ) was a German engineer and president of the German General Electric Company.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wilhelm Fraenkel was born on August 28, 1881 at Pest in the Vosges Republic, to a wealthy family. His father H. C. Fraenkel, an engineer, and his mother Eva Bernhard von Bätgen were both educated at the University of Würzburg ( today : Kiel University, Germany ) and received university degrees at Freiburg im Breisgau and Göttingen. In 1912, he left Göttingen and obtained his PhD in physics from the Universities of Bonn, Frankfurt am Main, and Göttingen. In 1916, he married Eleanor Schultz von Trusler. They had three sons, Henrik, Max and Reinhard, as well as a daughter. Wilhelm married Ana Perthes on April 15, 1923.  
 After three years at Freiburg im Breisgau, Wilhelm Fraenkel became the head of engineering there in 1924, and in 1933 founded the Rheinische Rheinische Chemieverein at Heidelberg, its first customer with Rheinberger Peugeot. In 1934, he was appointed director of the Härtelsturmforschungsdienst ( Technical Research Institute ) and concurrently became head of the company's Engineering Research Institute.  
 In 1939, when World War II broke out, Wilhelm Fraenkel joined the Nazi Party. During the war, he worked for the German Royal Navy in the Rasenwerke, following which he joined the naval arm of the German Navy on October 12, 1941, and remained there until August 22, 1943.  
 Fraenkel was described as `` a person of instinct, unimpressed by orders, intolerant of the moral degradation of others, prepared to rule through force and willing to sacrifice everything. ''  
 When he went to Algeria in 1945, he sent a message to Erhard Stumpf, German Foreign Minister, that he was going to liberate Algeria from Islam, and the French were of the opinion that Germany should get involved in the region. Fraenkel wanted France to take over the energy trade with Algeria, with the power to set the terms for the extraction of oil. After negotiations with the French, Albert Speer, then-Vice-Chancellor of Germany, told Fraenkel to get out of Algeria. However, Fraenkel also warned Stumpf that if France was not compelled, the Soviet Union would succeed in liberating Algeria. Fraenkel instructed Stumpf that he was from Russia and that he could not negotiate with him.Fraenkel remained in Algeria after the war was over, and was asked to help in reforming the French economy. In 1952, Fraenkel went to Moscow, where he was invited to become a director of Siboga Communications, a Russian company. In this position he was concerned with establishing a national radio system with the cooperation of the local telephone and telegraph companies, while also working on the Soviet-controlled Communications Experiment Station ( CPSU ). Fraenkel resigned in 1954, and was replaced by Hermann Seligman. He returned to Germany in 1956 and remained in this post until he died in 1963.  
 Fraenkel is known for his service in the German Air Force, as well as in military and technical matters. Fraenkel specialized in navigation and aeronautical equipment, and was a major in the German V-2 development program during the war. He established the Air-Speed Research Laboratory at Bielefeld to develop airplanes and jets, and built the Do 26 jet, the world's first supersonic jet powered by a liquid-fuel engine, which flew during the final test flight in 1959, just before the end of the war. He used the British Vega, a supersonic bomber, to perform blind aeronautical tests, with the plan of combining the twin-engined Vega with a more efficient turboprop aircraft to provide the ultimate supersonic machine. In his spare time he was also interested in biological research. He wrote a work on `` The Air Element in Babies '', and held an interest in the defence industry.

 = `` George Christy '' =  
George Christy ( June 19, 1887 - June 10, 1942 ) was a British physicist, pioneer of dynamical fluid mechanics, and co-discoverer of ferromagnetism.  
 Christy first took a course in mathematics at Balliol College, Cambridge in 1895. By 1901, he had graduated with an M.Sc. in physical chemistry from the University of Edinburgh. In 1903, he joined the Royal College of Science as a Physics lecturer and later became its Head of the Chemistry Department. In 1907, he won the Royal Society's Turing Medal, awarded by Lord Kelvin, for demonstrating that materials flow in a closed loop.  
 By 1916, he was Dean of the Engineering Faculty at the University of London. In that year, he coined the term `` Monoclinic contraflow '' to describe how a moving fluid smoothly flows between two points on the surface of a globe, which is necessary to accurately describe what a fluid could have been. This same principle, that particles flow in straight lines, is usually known as `` monoclinic contraflow ''. Christy's and Kelvin's lines'shared the same intuitive quality ; as Moore states, `` It was his idea that conic section had to be displayed in triangles and planar triangles. '' It also would be an error, Moore clarifies, to think that these curves were `` certainly 'infinite'lines, and that 'flat'points'could not be anything but points ', whereas the flow of fluids within liquids, with the necessary 'order'( or, in other words, if the lines went in circles, they had to have precisely defined lines ). ''  
 In 1927, he designed the first self-contained dynamical fluid laboratory, which was based on the model of a vacuum tube that supplied an inner tube containing three lids for the magnets, a fourth tube filled with solvent, and a vacuum that the upper secondary for each metal flowed into. Using the Monoclinic contraflow principle, it was possible to determine the velocity at which the solvents flowed into the first tube and continue to the second, and the third, and so on, adding up the flow speed. The resulting flow data could then be used to model flow in the rest of the machine, or to probe the wavefunctions that distinguish slow-acting liquid from more rapid-acting.  
 Christy is also well known for another discovery : the mineral potassium ores. In 1925, Christy's son, Richard Christy, a professor of biochemistry, began studying chemical isotopes of potassium, of which he found an isotope whose ratio to beryllium was positive and positive-to-negative. He went on to obtain isotope ratios to two to three standard deviations higher than those expected from the age of the Earth. When his son's work was published in 1929, Christy noted that he had `` solved the problem without naming a new element, though he made some research in a few scientific papers which, it is said, are amusing nonsense ''. A century later, Barry Zinn claimed in the second edition of his book Metaphysics and Cosmology that  
   
... Stephen G. Christy, in his article on ten years ago ( published in `` Science '' ) wrote of chemistry that the lines of a liquid that has a density greater than the energy given by ‘ potassium fluoride ’ ( that is, higher than 250 MeV per gram of salt ) flow slower than the lines of a liquid whose surface area is only twice that. On this reading, his assertion that the lines of the sodium fluoride, which are thought to be too heavy to flow at all, are carried by conical streams could hardly be more disregarded ; there is an element of chemistry, however well-known, which is within reach of mankind, namely the hydraulic operation of cooling salt of various degrees of hardness in chambers, for cooling the atmospheres of coal, gold, and silver mines, where the boiling and cooling of superfluid gases are of great importance.  
 The first reference to `` pure metal '' was made by Christy in 1910, but it took about 40 years for other authors to provide these original proofs of his.

Etienne Journon de Dolors ( 2 November 1844 – 23 September 1903 ) was a French mathematician. He made contributions to foundations of topology and symmetry, a study of the uniqueness of certain groups, and to formal theory.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Paris on 2 November 1844. His family became strong in law, not law : his father, Roulet de Lage, was a banker who fought the French Revolution ; his mother, the more liberal Madame de Délours. In 1876, he completed his first professional education.  
 In 1882, at the age of 19, he began his studies at the Sorbonne, and won a professorship there at the age of 23. He studied under Ernest Guilmant, from 1883 to 1888, earning his doctorate in 1886. He lectured on mathematics at the Paris Institute of Technology from 1886 to 1888, and at the University of Paris between 1891 and 1897. In 1897, he was invited by Napoleon III to join the faculty of the Sorbonne in Paris, where he stayed until his retirement in 1936. He became director of the Laboratory of Topology ( 1890–1895 ), and under a pseudonym of Antoine-Léon Gaudin, was a founding member of the International Union for Topology and Euclidean Algebra.He was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Paris on 3 May 1896, his first term as such.He was deeply interested in mathematics from the age of twelve, and started working in mathematics at a young age. In 1879 he began working on the relations between the geometry of curved spaces and the geometry of torus. In 1888, he became also known for his work in the foundations of topology and symmetry. In 1891, he made contributions to foundations of topology and symmetry. In 1902, he established a formal theory of primes, a case study in Euclidean geometry in which each prime of any arithmetic set can be written as a minimal elliptic set.  
 In 1900, the French Academy of Sciences elected him a member of the Académie des Sciences.

St John Finn Oskar ( 22 December 1880 – 20 February 1955 ) was a Finnish-American physicist and one of the founders of radar research. He was a member of the Industrial and Socioeconomic Advisory Committee, the Delegation of Science and Technology for Southeast Asia, and of the Committee on Transportation, Railways, and Communications ( CTSC ) for the developing countries. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1934.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Finn Oskar was born in Aalin. His parents were Finnsten Aikar and Marie Magdalena Aikar ( 1885–1969 ). His younger brother was Gudrun Aikar ( 1906–1996 ). Finn Aikar Oskar went on to graduate in physics from the University of Helsinki. He then moved to the United States and began working with Ernest Lawrence at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. After working there, Oskar moved to the Marshall Scientific Research Institute in Chicago to work with Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory. From there, he worked with Boris Isserles ( 1905–1986 ), Hans von Ohm ( 1913–1998 ), and Harold Walker ( 1916–1983 ). Among his co-workers were Robert McCormick and Rudolf Sommerfeld.  
   
   
 == Work at Los Alamos ==  
 Oskar joined Los Alamos in 1917 as a project officer, and worked on the Princeton experiment known as the Larmor experiment. The K-hole experiment was established at Los Alamos in 1935 in order to measure gravitational wave effects caused by the collaboration between Ernest Lawrence and Guglielmo Marconi. A K-hole is the inside of a sphere surrounded by the gravitational field of a very large mass. The K-hole is a source of gravitational waves. Oskar designed a tube from an old vacuum tube that they thought would be suitable for the Larmor experiment. They were confident enough in this tube that it would be used and eventually become the first optical part of the Larmor detector. From there, he left Los Alamos in January 1934 and began working at the JPL.  
   
   
 == Later career ==  
 In 1937, Oskar was appointed head of the Physics Laboratory in the Government Experimental Station in Gobi. In 1947, he was appointed Director of the Physical Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. In 1963, he was appointed Director of the Materials Science Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In 1975, he was named General Manager of DST Industries. He served in that capacity until his retirement in 1993.

Walter Münch ( January 26, 1876 – February 19, 1948 ) was a German-American physicist and engineer who was a co-founder of the Manhattan Project, managing, and directing the Oak Ridge Laboratory. He pioneered the design of multiple-actor reactors.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Münch was born in Darmstadt to a Jewish family, a grandson of Robert Schuyler Muench and Zella in Celle. From 1902, when he began high school, Münch lived in Switzerland, where he became acquainted with Heinrich Hertzberg. He was an instructor at the Würzburg Gymnasium and received a PhD in physics in 1910, the thesis work of the German Kaiser Wilhelm I in Berlin.  
 In 1920, he returned to Germany, where he was a professor at the Berlin Technische Hochschule from 1926 to 1936, then became a professor of electrical engineering at the Free University of Berlin from 1936 to 1939. After World War II, he worked at Princeton University.  
 He retired as a professor in 1955 and died in New Jersey, on February 19, 1948, after a short illness.  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 According to the nuclear weapons program adopted by the United States government at the time of Operation Paperclip, he helped secure funding for its fusion program, and spent most of his years in France where he was the associate director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics ( now INFN ). After the war he returned to the United States, where he became a professor of experimental physics at University of Pennsylvania, receiving honorary degrees in 1965 from Northwestern University and from the University of Iowa in 1980.The first-ever use of a superconducting super-envelope ( S-type ) was made in August 1941, by the ENIAC. In 1945, Münch and Wolfgang Pauli built the precursor of the modern quadruple-inductive AC super-conductor using the compression of 80,000 pig iron filings into two concentric rings of n-1, n-2, and n-3 per pound of iron core. This device proved able to accelerate more than four million electron volts per kilogram.

 = Thomas Hodge (physicist) =  
Thomas Hodge FRS ( 17 February 1770 – 21 June 1837 ) was a British physicist.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Born at Cirencester, Sussex, he was educated at the local grammar school and then in the University of St. Andrews, with a particular interest in physics and mathematics. His father, Thomas Rawcliffe Hodge, was a doctor and came to England with Thomas Rawcliffe Wakefield ( 1715–1775 ) from London. Hodge earned a BSc in 1773 and a Doctorate in 1774. He studied under Andrew Fludd ( 1727–1807 ), James Thomson ( 1747–1832 ) and Christopher Wren ( 1744–1810 ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1784, Hodge became professor of physics at the Royal College of Surgeons in London. In 1797 he was made an examiner in physics, and had a small practical base there for a period of time, when a summer trip to Paris interrupted this. In 1799 he made the acquaintance of Henry Miley ( 1726–1815 ), whom he subsequently married in 1799. The two men had a very close relationship and this allowed Hodge to research briefly in chemistry and magnetism.  
   
 Hodge applied his theoretical chemistry to physics and set up a laboratory in St. John's Chapel, one of the first buildings of its kind in the country.He was, in connection with the preparation of The Principles of Chemistry, one of the editors of The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1817. His publication included an exhaustive analysis of the ordinary vibrations of acids, the electricity and magnetism in those chemicals, and of the properties of metals.This was followed in 1813 by A Treatise on Magnetism ( also known as The Magnetism of Carbonic Acid, Metals, and Transistors ), where he proposed the world's first magnetisation principle. In 1818, having also studied glass, he set up his own business, selling the production of glass to glass manufacturers. He married the daughter of the Rev. George Howard ( 1781–1840 ), the first non-royal to hold this post in the Church of England, on 3 April 1822. After his retirement from his clerical career, Hodge assumed the periodical duties of editor, in 1825 to 1829. On his death the magazine published a continuation of his work under the title of Materia Medica Magna ( 1828–1837 ), which succeeded in perpetuating his prestige in chemistry. He also co-edited with Wren, Physica Chemistry. In 1836, John Tennant, London, publisher of those papers, offered him an appointment as editor and declared him `` one of the greatest modern students and practitioners of the more general science of physics ''.In 1839 he became acting examiner for science and for three years was president of the Royal Institution of the Royal Society, the first non-royal to hold the post. He was one of the founders of the Royal Academy of Arts and Letters, holding the chair until 1846. In 1849 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1851 its president.

James Curtis No. 1 ( ; US : “ James Curtis ’ ) ( US : US : James C. Curtis ; 2 February 1661 – 10 December 1699 ) was an American ornithologist who was born in Lawrence, Kansas, the son of John Curtis and Rebecca Gifford, and studied at the Lawrence Academy and the University of Maryland School of Arts.  
 He was the grandfather of Thomas Gifford No. 1, whom was also a naturalist and farmer, and of Samuel Curtis No. 1, who was an illustrator. He is said to have been one of the founders of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Philadelphia, an activist for election laws and made the foreword to Muckleshoot ’ s History of Muckleshoot, and the correspondent of the Major Annals of America, an author on botany, economics, geography, and education.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He graduated from the Lyceum School of Arts and Letters in Boston in 1661, and was enrolled by the Lyceum as a student of history, geometry, and botany. He took an undergraduate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1669, graduating in 1672. He wrote a medical treatise on the eye and optic nerve and a monograph of Indian geography, as well as a history of the settlers of America. He was chaplain to the New England Colonies, and was also chaplain to the infantry of the army of Virginia at New York City. In 1675, he left Boston and travelled on horseback, in consequence of the Survey of the United States as it then stood, leading him across the Atlantic to North America, where he settled in New Haven, Connecticut. He is reported to have given an account of his extensive travels and of his efforts to promote humane regulations among the Indians.After a visit to Amsterdam in 1678, he emigrated to England, where he commenced agriculture and worked as an engraver and illustrator, becoming a manufacturer of bookplates and maps. He was elected one of the inaugural members of the Royal Society, a member of the College of Surgeons, and was a member of the Royal Engineers and the Royal Commissioners of the Admiralty. In 1680 he published The Planting of Butterflies, describing many of the plants now cultivated and being cultivated at that time. Curtis carried out this work in conjunction with W. A. Dewar of Kensington, England, who brought it into the hands of the flora of the New World, the style of which changed in accordance with the new discoveries made.  
   
 Curtis's medical knowledge is now well known through his contemporaries. He was an associate member of the British Association, and he was engaged by his employer as a `` guide, and physician to the young in America and Ireland ''. He is the father of all who were born on the continent.  
 As an assistant of Robert Hooke to the surgeon William Howard Hooker, the naturalist who prepared the first portion of a famous Indian treatise on the Indian philosophy and natural history of America, Curtis published what is today known as the `` Hooker's plant-graph '' in 1692, containing Curtis's own description of the Pineal Gland. Curtis became acquainted with the present day traditions of the indigenous peoples of America through contact with their herbarium. He wrote an article about Indian gardening in 1687.  
 In 1695, Curtis was sent to England to study methods of forming war drums and other weapons, on the instruction of fellow scientist Edwin Bodger. In 1698, he was one of the discoverers of a cholera epidemic in London. He provided the later seeds to form the Boston Stove, among the other distinguished Indian craftsmen who populated that new colony. The Pilgrim Fathers provided two distinctive streets named after them.Curtis was married to Elizabeth Gibbs, a young widow. His five children survived him.  
 He died in London on 10 December 1699.

 == Biography ==   
    
    
 === Early years ===   
 Karrer was born in Moscow , Russia to Paul Karrer and Julie Lerch , both Swiss nationals . In 1892 Karrer 's family returned to Switzerland where he was educated at Wildegg and at the grammar school in Lenzburg , Aarau , where he matriculated in 1908 . He studied chemistry at the University of Zurich under Alfred Werner and after gaining his Ph.D. in 1911 , he spent a further year as assistant in the Chemical Institute . He then took a post as chemist with Paul Ehrlich at the Georg Speyer Haus , Frankfurt-am-Main . In 1919 he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical Institute .   
    
    
 === Research ===   
 Karrer 's early research concerned complex metal compounds but his most important work has concerned plant pigments , particularly the yellow carotenoids . He elucidated their chemical structure and showed that some of these substances are transformed in the body into vitamin A . His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for beta-carotene , the chief precursor of vitamin A ; the first time that the structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established . George Wald worked briefly in Karrer 's lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the retina . Later , Karrer confirmed the structure of ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) and extended his researches into the vitamin B2 and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the flavins led to identification of lactoflavin as part of the complex originally thought to be vitamin B2 .   
 Karrer published many papers , and received many honours and awards , including the Nobel Prize in 1937 . His textbook Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie ( Textbook of Organic Chemistry ) was published in 1927 , went through thirteen editions , and was published in seven languages .

 = Wilhelm Olbers Focke =   
Wilhelm Olbers Focke ( 5 April 1834 , Bremen – 29 September 1922 , Bremen ) was a medical doctor and botanist who in 1881 published a significant work on plant breeding entitled Die Pflanzen-Mischlinge , Ein Beitrag zur Biologie der Gewächse ( The plant hybrids , a contribution to the biology of plants ) which briefly mentioned Gregor Mendel 's discoveries on hybridization . Although Charles Darwin had a copy of Focke 's book he passed it along to a colleague apparently without reading this particular section . The rediscovery of Mendel 's work is generally considered to have taken place in the first years of the 20th century , however in Die Pflanzen-Mischlinge , Mendel is mentioned about 18 times - although Focke did not apparently take Mendel 's work all that seriously . Along with hybridization , Focke analyzed the non-Mendelian phenomena of graft hybrids , pseudogamy , and xenia .   
 In 1889 Focke conducted an inquiry into the former occurrence of malaria in Northern Germany . He also did much of the work throughout his life on the taxonomy of Rubus ( Rosaceae ) and published several studies ( 1877-1914 ) . He wrote a number of section monographs for Adolf Engler and Karl Anton Eugen Prantl eds . Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien in the family Rosaceae , notably regarding fruit-bearing plants of that family .   
 Much of his other output was published in the Bremen periodical : Abhandlungen : Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein zu Bremen , a complete list of the published papers in this periodical is available . On examining the Focke entries on this list of articles , one can appreciate the wide range of subjects that he studied as well as the industry with which he applied himself to his work .

 = Henry West =  
Henry West FRS ( 10 October 1882 – 26 November 1942 ) was an English physician and plant pathologist who was famous for isolating the rare parasitic fenugreek disease Haemophilus pneumoniae. His publications in Nature influenced the discovery of the immune reaction to the organism.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 West was born in Southampton and educated at Southampton Grammar School, then the Earl's school in Gloucester. After earning his MD from St Mary's Hospital in 1899, he practised in a small practising school in Westgate for the rest of his life.  
 In 1903 he joined the Imperial College of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene where, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, he worked with the interwar plague experts. In October 1917 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a botanicalist, before moving to the Cavendish Laboratory where he worked on producing anthrax and for many years discovered many new pathogenic fungi. West gave up professional duties to concentrate on scientific research in 1918, undertaking the first scientific assessment of the nature of the plague in England. In 1927 he introduced the isolation of a dangerous black widow's disease pathogen, Haemophilus pneumoniae, in Wales, as a cure. His results suggested that the disease was spread through contact with the blood and muscle of a healthy infected victim, a conclusion later confirmed by both James Radcliffe, the British Army's chief of bacteriology, and Henry Draper, founder of the American bacteriological department. It was noted by those involved in the investigation that West had been particularly favourable to Radcliffe and Draper, and in particular to Draper for his help. Although the Legion of Merit award was granted to West for his services, the outbreak of the First World War proved the real reason for his retirement from the Royal Army Medical Corps. His insistence on imposing high standards on medical work and in particular on blood research was demonstrated by his influence on a number of top scientists in Britain, including Richard Lewis Thompson ( one of the first American microbiologists ), Gino Bailli, John Mackintosh, and W. Hewitt Stearns.  
 West died on 26 November 1942 from pneumonia following a brief illness. His research on the plague spread the same way he had promised : through leaflets placed in the homes of infected families. The women were urged to draw the blood of sick and convalescent persons in order to collect any blood in the family's home, leaving it with a host of parasites that could then be taken home to cause the disease. A common misconception in the eyes of some had been the theory that body contact with the blood of healthy people ensured a cure, but West was clear in his identification and diagnosis : it was the process of incubation and contact between the patient and blood that developed the fever and caused the clinical symptoms. West showed that a host of blood-borne protozoa could transfer pathogenic in the blood of an infertile person, and he immediately alerted World Health Organisation authorities.  
   
   
 == Scientific contributions ==  
 West conducted much of his research and clinical work in England with the Legionnaires'Disease Research Unit in Colchester, assisted by Albert Costas after he became director of the unit. West is known for the public relations campaign of laying hard and fast foundations and turning out campaigners such as William Horner and Terence Maugham for the outbreak in Rotherham ; this was almost entirely to provide support to children, both from the Rotherham Association ( the local school ) and adults in Rotherham, and the environment.

Carl-Ludwig Gerd ( February 12, 1903 – March 8, 1993 ) was a German-born American physicist, best known for his contributions to applied mathematics, numerical physics, fundamental mechanics, statistical mechanics, plasma physics, infrared radiation, and plasma optics. He became a citizen of the United States in 1951 and is buried at Auburn Hills Memorial Park.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Carl-Ludwig Gerd ( 1863–1934 ) was born in Stuttgart, Germany. He received his secondary education in Strasbourg and Berlin and in 1921 completed his first Ph.D. under Rudolf Lorentz in Munich. In 1925, he joined Friedrich-Wilhelm Niemann University ( today ’ s ETH Zurich ) as an assistant professor and held the professorship there until his death. From 1929 to 1930, he also worked at the Technical University of Berlin, where he conducted research into plasma physics, magnetic fields, and scattering problems. In 1933, he joined the faculty of the German Technical University of Munich ( German: DTHUM, also known as ETH München ). Later, Gerd was made associate professor and professor emeritus at the Institut für Physik in 1930 and professor emeritus at the University of Liège in 1933.  
 Gerd authored the widely used `` Quantum Mechanics '' textbook with Alfred Reichert ( 1900–1972 ) and the book with Felix Klein ( 1929–1985 ). Gerd is noted for coining the terms `` background '' ( baryon electron ) and `` zero point '' ( electron pair ) to denote the least probable electron states of particles in the positron and muon.He is considered the founder of quantum field theory, and was the first to apply Einstein's theory of general relativity to study particles in the high energy state.Gerd also played an important role in the development of the Theory of the Sheaf. While at DTHUM, he was also the first to give an explicit explanation of the differential integrals ( included in the Lorentz–Gerd formulation of a wave equation ) by which the magnetic field of a wave appears to change with the polarization ( orientation ) of its reflection ( warping ), giving an efficient formula for estimating its magnitude. He eventually developed the form of uncertainty principle for quantum field theories in his many papers.On April 29, 1939, he married Mabel Lang and they had two sons and two daughters.Gerd was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science.

Campegius Vitringa Sr. , or Kempe Vitringa ( born at Leeuwarden , May 16 , 1659 ; died at Franeker , March 31 , 1722 ) was a Dutch Protestant theologian and Hebraist . His youngest of four children was Campeius Vitringa ( 1693-1723 ) .   
 Vitringa , a follower of Johannes Cocceius , was a supporter of prophetic theology . He was educated at the universities of Franeker and Leiden , and became professor of Oriental languages at the former in 1681 . When locating prophetic outcomes , he would associate events to the near rather than the far-off future , placing a distinct focus on the period of the Maccabees ( 2nd Century BC ) . Like Joseph Mede ( 1586-1638 ) , Vitringa believed wholeheartedly that the Millennium was yet to come , but did not expect any immediate changes . He relegated the end of the time to a remote future and strongly emphasized the concept of New Jerusalem . His most important student is considered Herman Venema ( 1697-1787 ) , who was a theology professor at Franeker.Vitringa ’ s two chief works are his dissertation on the synagogue , De Synagoga Vetere Libri Tres ( Franeker , 1685 ; 2d ed . 1696 ) ; and his Commentary on Isaiah ( Leeuwarden , 1714–20 ) , which was frequently republished in the eighteenth century . The latter was up to the time of Gesenius the most considerable contribution to the exegesis of Isaiah . His other works include , Sacrarum Observationum Libri Sex ( Franeker , 1683-1708 ) and Anacrisis Apocalypseos Joannis Apostoli ( 1705 ) .   
    
    
 == Anacrisis Apocalypseos ==   
    
 Vitringa ’ s most notable work was Anacrisis Apocalypseos Joannis Apostoli ( 1705 ) , which was considered a major event , in the history of prophetic theology at the turn of the 18th century . He drew extensively on the Clavis Apocalyptica ( 1627 ) , by Joseph Mede ( 1586-1638 ) . Vitringa ’ s work was regarded the first major study to analyze the Book of Revelation as a structured chronological outline of the history of the Christian church . His interpretation of the Apocalypse was that of a coded description of the history of the New Testament Church . Though Vitringa had integrated the historical method of Hugo Grotius in past work , he rejected the view of Grotius and Bossuet that associated John ’ s visions exclusively to early Christendom .

At the age of five he received his studies in his father's factory in Boulogne, but when the factory closed in 1887, Grider entered the school of the Rabbi Bernhard Breuer and also studied at the Sorbonne. In 1890, after receiving his Ph.D. degree, he received a commission to work as the physiologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1896 he was appointed to the position of demonstrator at the Pasteur Institute, and in 1900, professor of pathology at the Pasteur Institute.In 1904, he became a professor in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute and he was also sent to several hospitals, especially at the Thionville Hospital in Antibes, the Caen hospital, and the Arles Hospital in the Grand Duchy of Toulouse. In 1904, he was also awarded the title of professor of hygiene.In 1908, Grider developed a fever of the respiratory tract, to which he attributed the presence of bacteria of the minor group gram-negative microflora, and subsequently, by 1905, he was able to diagnose various illnesses as bacterial pneumonias, first with the use of a modified blood culture which could detect either bacteria of the pneumonic or bronchoalveolar origin, or with iron phosphate staining.

Leonie-Marie-Marie-Tavard ( 4 March 1908 – 21 August 1993 ) was a French cellist and music educator who is considered one of the leading cellists of the 20th century.  
 Tavard had a huge family background. Her father Louis Tavard was a curate at a retreat for over a hundred patients at Saint-Yves, Paris and his mother was the daughter of Theodor Louis Tavard and Evelyn-André Fleury. In 1928, she was already a student in the conservatory of music in Paris ; this, despite being extremely talented and singing in opera and as a cellist. She also received lessons with Donné de Beaufey.  
 Tavard was one of the preeminent cellists in France, and was asked to conduct many concerts of duos under duress. The French composer César Franck named her after him.Tavard was one of the most respected cellists of the 19th century, where she made important recordings of works by composers such as Jacob Gluck, Jean-Baptiste-Auguste Massenet, Marcel Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edgard Varèse, André-François Meeus, Auguste Dufort, Harold Bloom, and Simon Furman. Her repertoires and teaching continue to be the envy of cellists of the 20th century.Among her students were Didier de Rivière, who later taught at the conservatory of music in New York. Mavro Borisov was a cellist for whom Tavard was equally devoted.While recording solo cello and violin works for the New York Philharmonic, she later did joint recordings with Baroness Cordier and other composers.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Tavard's work won praise from the leading composers of the time. Frédéric Chopin admired her recording skills. Adam Polyansky described her as `` the virtuoso cellist of the 20th century '' and said she was capable of `` bringing music to life like the finest pianist. `` She also played on many orchestras and numerous violin ensembles including these :  
   
 L'Écossaire, Bellagio, New York Philharmonic, John Williams Sonatas, Great Western Symphony Orchestra  
 Décade, Mer  
 La Marseillaise, New York Philharmonic, Maschera Organ Quartet

Louis Auguste Henri de Candolle ( 23 August 1777 – 4 September 1839 ) was a French naturalist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Rouen, Candolle graduated in medicine from the University of Paris in 1778, followed by botany in 1780. He was a faculty member in the French Academy in 1783 and 1784 and served as rector of his university from 1791. From 1796 until 1806, he was director of the Botanical Garden in Paris.

 Candolle was a personal friend of Pierre Fouché, and together they discovered many new species. Among their discoveries were Polypum. In 1804 they founded the Lepidoptera of France. In 1805, Candolle's collections were purchased by Louis Leclerc, and the collection was sent to the University of Paris. Candolle's collection was distributed to other museums and collections, including the Botanical Garden, and soon became the basis of numerous classes. He maintained the collection with a limited maintence, and during his time at the botanical garden, his collections in Rouen were often attended by European and American entomologists.In 1823, Candolle was elected a member of the Académie des sciences. In 1824 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.  
 In 1834 he founded the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, and from 1846 until his death he served as president of the Societe botanique de France.

 = Wilhelm Ludwig Norendorf =  
Wilhelm Ludwig Norendorf ( German : [ ˈweːl̡nɔ̯ fʁilɛ ] ; 10 November 1847 – 9 April 1931 ) was a German scientist and a researcher at the Technical University of Berlin.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He graduated from the Leipzig Gymnasium in 1876, received his doctorate there in 1882, and from 1884 to 1890 was professor of physical chemistry. From 1890 to 1901 he served as chair of physical chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin. In 1902, he founded the `` Linnéstleftey '', a laboratory for physical chemistry, in the laboratories of the university, before moving to the Technische Hochschule Berlin.  
 From 1902 to 1905 he was director of the Institute for Physical Chemistry and the Chemical Institute of the Technical University of Berlin. Norendorf worked under Leo Kornmesser, the eminent physicist who had gone on to become head of the German Academy of Sciences in 1924.  
 He was at first critical of Jewish students, and although his contributions in chemical research were generally received with great enthusiasm he ultimately found that the emigration of `` Jewish savages '' was leading to increasing ecological deterioration. Following a series of conferences and public lectures, Norendorf went into exile from Germany in 1904 and returned to the Technical University of Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1931.  
 He was the author of a collection of scientific papers on zoological subjects, Theological View of Botany and Animal Diseases ( 1910 ), which made him renowned among the scientific community. He was a member of the Societatis Scientiarum Dei Dei.  
 Norendorf made important contributions to chemical analysis, and he introduced NMR spectroscopy into experimental biology. In 1907, after more than thirty years in Berlin, Norendorf accepted a chair in the Rensch-Eberstelle deutschen Physiologie at the Technical University of Berlin, which he held until 1919.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Norendorf was responsible for the founding of the laboratory for physical chemistry at the Technische Hochschule, and with Hans Lohmann, he created the basis of NMR spectroscopy, which he subsequently published. He was also the co-author of the manuscript on teratology which appeared in the first edition of Volume 4 of the German scientific journal, the Journal of Experimental Biology.  
   
   
 === Norendorf ’ s principle of predictive death ===  
 Norendorf's idea on predictive death was that the disease experienced in a particular patient will sometimes be followed by a decrease in the subsequent prognosis.  
 Norendorf suggested the hypothesis that any change in prognosis indicates a sufficient progressive deterioration in the prognosis. In 1899, he reported that the `` Precisely ” tumor following lung cancer was more likely to have progressed to latent infection when patients were given a “ course of an antibiotic ”, and that to make a prognosis accurate, he required a patient to die before dying of some other cancer, or complications.For a considerable period of time after Norendorf ’ s death, in Germany, in the late twentieth century, there were efforts to establish a new nomenclature for diseases with predictable prognoses.  
 The cause of regression is the reason for a previous diagnosis.  
 Pain caused by arthritis has been called an `` asterisk ich nachthen ” ( asterisk principle ).

 = John Baines (humourist) =  
John Baines ( 2 June 1844 – 7 September 1908 ) was a British humourist and broadcaster. He worked as editor of one of the earliest early newspapers on German military and naval affairs. He then made an important contribution to the history of satire, from the 1850s to the late 19th century, writing some 200 essays and non-fiction books.  
 He was born in Burney, Surrey, the son of J.B. Baines ( 1818–1902 ) and Mary Pinchbeck ( 1840–1903 ). His older brother, the satirist James Baines, was also a novelist, having created a study of crime in the 1850s, and edited the popular memoirs of the 1857 Columbian Exposition.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Baines studied at Eton College in 1881, and was then awarded a scholarship to study at Christ Church, Oxford. This provided him with an extensive background in Germanic culture, and served him well in his career as a historian and comedy writer. As a native of the North of England, he had a long habit of preferring the more civilized education of the educated classes and was talented at the art of creating mockable characters and supplying them with material. With such ease, Baines at the age of twenty-two formed the primary plot-point of many of his earlier stories, and perhaps also adapted the gallant Protestant, Cornish-Scottish knight from The Two Towers, despite his Scottish heritage. However, after a period as an unpaid lecturer, when others were leaving the UK to take post-graduate positions in Germany, he ultimately abandoned study and moved on to active ministry.  
   
   
 === Glimpses of the Italian World ===  
 Baines followed this with a series of books published in 1901 and 1902, exploring a wide range of topics in the history of Italian war and naval affairs. In 1902, Baines was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1914 the Order of the British Empire. In a long letter to his friend, the poet Herbert Findlay ( 1850-1913 ), he expresses disgust with the treatment of Napoleon's position in Italy, as well as his strategic misdeeds. These both point towards the influence that glee in general and humour in particular can have on history, as well as his recommendation for Baines not to consider joining the British army.  
 In later years, Baines made occasional appearances as a guest commentator on history, even appearing on the radio, and wrote several autobiographical and memoirs. In 1902, he invited another old friend, the playwright C. R. Lodge, to sing the march of Gallipoli to a surviving recruits of the enemy. While he was singing, nine soldiers were blinded by a fireworks display. Baines later recalled the experience of watching three men blinded by a sapling blast to the head ; their shocked appearance was the result of hearing so much noise that they thought it was a rifle shot, and, witnessing the amputation of three fingers and the flash of exploding shells, regarded it as `` the greatest feat of human comedy '' he had witnessed.  
   
   
 === The Oldest Individualist Society and Gilbert Russell ===  
 Another of Baines'works of historical comedy was the creation of an extended satirical system of English county names, setting forth the seeds of the ideas in the early comedy of The Oldest Individualist Society. Published posthumously in 1915, this book has been criticised for containing predictable gags, although many of these were based on original material, and for avoiding in favour of greater historical accuracy.  
   
   
 == Later life and death ==  
 Baines died in St Peter's, Woolwich, London, and was buried in his ancestral Catterick home, at the Lambeth Cemetery in Borough Market.

After studies in the Theological Faculty of the University of Athens and parochial responsibilities in Munich , he served in various positions within the Patriarchate of Alexandria culminating in that of Metropolitan of Axum covering Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa . Fouiyas ' studies and encounters led to a favourable understanding of the Church of England which he saw in some respects as a continuator of the Saxon Church before the Norman Conquest , the Gregorian Reform and most importantly the East–West Schism of 1054 . He was thus seen as the ideal candidate for the post of archbishop in London . Several years experience however of deepening division within Anglicanism led him openly to suggest ( in an article in The Times ) that the road to unity for Anglicans lay in submission to the discipline of the Roman Catholic church . As his post involved close relations with Lambeth it was judged expedient that he should be recalled . Methodios assumed the title of Pisidia and continued his studies ( notably on Bessarion ) in Greece .

 = Anton de Vries =  
Anton De Vries, also spelled De Vries, ( 2 April 1731 – 8 August 1816 ) was a Dutch geographer.  
 His father, Jacob de Vries, was a writer of Encyclopaedia Britannica, and whose library was included in the hall of the Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam. His mother, Anna Caroline, a bookseller and antiquarian, was a well-known Dutch traveller in the Dutch East Indies, and probably a native of Amsterdam.  
 In 1794, during the Dutch Reformation, Anton de Vries became a Catholic ; the Reformation was coming to an end in Holland, and he became a Reformed Calvinist, and kept close to it throughout his life. De Vries'own opinion on the Reformation was positive : he expressed his belief that the Reformation was unnecessary, and the Protestants true members of the Church. Thus he believed that all the doctrines of Jesus Christ were truths which were to be found in Christianity. He defended the legitimacy of the Reformed Churches and their institutions. De Vries took special care that his view should never be misunderstood or misunderstood ; this is evident by his attitude to Protestant missions in Holland and in England. He also tried to establish peace between the Protestants and the Catholic Church ; when English travellers went to Dutch Holland to learn about the Reformation, he was, no doubt, very pleased to make arrangements for their stay in Dutch towns, so that they might return home later to hear the Protestant preacher preach and judge for themselves whether he was right. One of his best-known sermons was delivered at Amsterdam in 1777, upon the day of the plague. This speech was published in a pamphlet at his request in 1775. He also took part in the suppression of the Congregational Church at Amsterdam ; this took place at the instigation of Johan van der Lubbe.  
 De Vries was probably one of the three men who, in September 1651, surveyed the western coast of Canada, perhaps the most important of any geographical survey to make a thorough sketch of the country's terrain, geography and climate.  
 Among the works cited in De Vries's pamphlet The Geography of the World by His Enquiry into The Movements and Accomplishments of the Engravers and Weavers is `` Which Furthers To Further the Antiquities of Man, and their Revealing Ways, With Full Reference to the Orientals and modes of Relation. ''

 = Horace D. Drake =  
Horace Drake FRS ( September 21, 1922 – September 5, 2004 ) was a British–American geneticist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Horace Drake graduated with a degree in mathematics from Leeds University, earning his PhD on the `` Coenzyme-3 Enzyme and its mRNA '' from Harvard University in 1955. His PhD students included John A. Lawson, Dr. Robert Meltzer, Dr. Roland C. Hyatt, Dr. Brian David Levy, E. Robert Jackson, and George Albert Hauser.  
 In 1956 he obtained a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Texas at Austin. In 1959 he joined the Cornell University School of Medicine and earned his M.D. in 1960 with a thesis, The Role of Genes in the Significance of Differences in Drug Delivery to and Population Dynamics.  
 In the mid-1960s Drake went to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research on hereditary diseases and genetics in the birth defects and cancer research laboratories.  
 He made major contributions in the area of common diseases and genetic variants : from studying the linkage of congenital diabetes to presenilin-T and in detecting signatures of mutations associated with lethal syphilis in pregnancies, he learned about recessive types of sickle cell disease and from 1958, he became an early expert on altered patterns of chromosome imprinting in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Alveolar and Colic.  
 The major breakthrough, however, came in 1964 when he and Henry D. Cowan showed that mutations in a gene known as G protein-coupled receptor ( GPR41 ) functioned as a lifelong alternate control for a genetic disorder caused by the overexpression of the defective gene. More significantly, it was here that Drake proposed an explanation for genetic imprinting in inheritance ( disease ) and explained the essential role of regulation of the G protein-coupled receptor in regulatory systems ( pathological changes ), such as the control of protein secretion and protein kinetics ( how cells and tissues send and receive nutrients and nutrients'metabolic energy ). He and Cowan thus created the model of a genetic predisposition ( in their terminology, disease ) and discovered a way to genetically segregate variants of this particular gene. Together, they founded, in 1967, the Genetic Epidemiology Group ( GEG ) and made a foundational contribution to the use of gene-environment interaction models in genetic epidemiology.  
 Drake remained at Cornell University until retiring in 1982. In 1988 he and his wife, Margaret, bought a home in Duluth, Minnesota.  
 He remained on the faculty of the University of Minnesota.  
 Drake was honored with the Adolphe and Marion Guérin Family Foundation for his leadership in both advancing genetics and in fostering biomedical research.

 = Robert C. Nichols =  
Robert C. Nichols ( 14 January 1915 – 7 January 2006 ) was an American econometrician and chairman of the economics department at George Washington University, where he held the position of economics professor for 15 years.He was born in Bridgewater, New Jersey, to parents John John Nichols and Elmer Primm Nichols. He earned his BA from the University of Pennsylvania in 1938 and his PhD in 1946 from the University of Michigan with a thesis entitled `` Bipartisan Finance ''. His first paid academic appointment was as assistant chief of staff at the Department of Commerce in Washington DC, where he also served as the Director of the Regional Economic Research Center. While at the Commerce Department, he also became a founding member of the Economic Research Service ( ERS ), and served as its chief economist from 1964 to 1966. He then returned to the University of Michigan as its director of the Institute for Work Study from 1968 to 1969, and from 1970 to 1971, as its associate director.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 As part of his work on economic cycle theory, he advocated the economic imperative model, which would predict the best course of action for a host of economic actors when faced with a political choice that included certain policies, especially that of the Republican Presidential nominee Ronald Reagan. Nichols helped refine the doctrine of a cost function ( finding that if the constraints of current economic policy are not great enough, any policy that raises costs can have a marginal increase in output and employment ) and created a novel rule for comparing labor costs with current levels of unemployment in the absence of a growth in available labor markets, as well as an economic equilibrium model, based on the premise that only low wage workers are ever required to accept unemployment benefits.His most significant contributions to macroeconomics came during his tenure at the University of Michigan, starting in 1969. After completing his PhD work with colleague E. P. Putnam, Nichols began work at George Washington University as a full professor in 1970. With George Washington University's Industrial Development Policy Program, Nichols developed the economic component to the key achievement of the National Research Council, a New Economic Development ( NED ) program that set objectives for national economic growth in terms of development and the capacity to improve living standards. Nichols'work was the driving force behind the NED and is considered to be the foundation for many subsequent NED programs.  
 In 1971, Nichols retired as director of the Institute for Work Study, and began the creation of a second-year Department of Economics endowed chair at the University. Nichols'tenure at the University of Michigan was historically one of expansion rather than retrenchment, and continued the long-term renewal of the new Faculty of Economics. During his tenure at the university, Nichols championed research by Alex M. Reichelt and Jacques Roux, and wrote popular works on macroeconomics for students. In 1999, Nichols retired as a professor at George Washington University, and received a government retirement pension of $ 300,000 for 10 years.  
 In 2005, Nichols was named the 21st president of the International Association for the Advancement of Economic Studies.

Jean-Baptiste-Michel Bucquet ( French : [ bykɛ ] ; 18 February 1746 – 24 January 1780 ) was a French chemist , member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences , physician and public teacher .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Bucquet was born in Paris , in 1746 . He was first sent to study law but he then turned to science and attended classes at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris . There he encountered for the first time chemistry applied to medicine . Despite financial trouble , he graduated in 1770 and thus became Docteur-Régent , and married Marie Claude Leredde shortly after . He then started teaching a public course in chemistry in his own laboratory . Between 1771 and 1773 , Bucquet published a manual of chemistry , first on mineral then on vegetal chemistry , destined for the use of beginners in the science who need a coherent overview of the different processes and products in use . This manual was intended for people attending his course but also for those who could not . Bucquet 's public course carried out for several years , and was mentioned in the Journal de Médecine . In 1775 , Bucquet became professor of pharmacy at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris , and the next year , following the death of Augustin Roux , he took the chair of chemistry at the Faculty . He became part of the French Academy of Sciences as a chemist in 1777 . During his years at the Academy , he published a few works of chemical analysis , including one in collaboration with the duke of La Rochefoucauld . He eventually acquired the laboratory in rue Jacob which used to belong to the chemist Rouelle and carried out his public courses there . He continued giving public courses until 1779 , at which point he became to ill to continue . He was known to be a very good teacher and many attended his courses . He died of his disease in 1780 .   
 His most famous pupil was Antoine-François Fourcroy who later carried on Bucquet 's work on natural history .   
    
    
 == Collaboration with Lavoisier ==   
 In 1777 , Bucquet worked with Antoine Lavoisier at his residence of the Arsenal , performed many fundamental experiments of chemistry , with the aim of checking if there results which were widely used in chemistry , could still be considered reliable . Lavoisier had the financial means and necessary laboratory equipment to perform such a task and Bucquet brought his many years of experience in public demonstration and laboratory expertise . Together , they published 26 memoirs at the Academy of Sciences . which led to Bucquet 's nomination as Academician .

 = Andr C3 A8ln (motorcycle racer) =  
André Milén ( August 6, 1877, Villiers – October 31, 1962, La Jolla, California ) was a French American motorcyclist and stuntman who made major contributions to motorcycle racing and United States motoring. He was described as the `` father of modern motorcycle performance '' by him, George Kleynhans, in the preceding chapter of `` Thoroughbreds, American Racing and Speed '', noting his numerous stunt career victories.Milén also competed on The New York/Pennsylvania Showground ( first in the gun machines and then in the gun airplanes, for the purpose of shooting off high-speed sparks ) and in local motorcycle races in many places. His televised stunt-airs were filmed in many locations in his native France, Austria, Sweden, Australia, Switzerland and other European countries. He is also known for many amateur motorcycle races and spectacles in which he appeared alongside professional riders.Milén went to school at the Conservatoire des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and then started a line of motorcycles in 1947. By 1959, Milén had changed the colors from khaki to chambray, and he started his own line of motorcycles, as well, also in chambray. He made the short trip from Paris to Montpellier, France in 1957, through the United States, where he turned down a number of requests from American racing teams. He then drove to California, where he started his `` moto trail '', or `` motorcycle racing playground '', which was apparently named in honor of his father.From 1968 to 1972 he was an editor and broadcaster for `` The Early Show with Jim Hoffa ''.  
   
   
 == Early career ==  
   
 Milén began his professional racing career in 1911 as a professional standup in Paris's `` Grand Prix Galeries '' circuit. In 1928, in the final years of his university career, he entered `` La Jolla motorcycle racing, '' the first major American motorcycle racing series, to which he showed tremendous talent. He showed outstanding track speed in the 1960 U.S. Grand Prix series, for which he won the title and helped his team retain it. Milén was, however, officially retired in 1963, but that season he was just 29 years old. He won a championship in the 1969 U.S. Grand Prix series. He qualified for the grand prix championship of the Grand Prix Galeries of Europe ( in Spain ) that same year, although he never got there. Milén's star faded, however, in the 1970 U.S. Grand Prix series, when he retired. Milén's high-speed guns were so powerful that they were impossible to control, and he ran out of speed control options. Milén returned to the United States for the 1972 U.S. Grand Prix series, when he briefly returned to the famous race circuits of Montpellier and Antwerp, winning again. Milén was again presented with an opportunity to continue racing in the 1973 U.S. Grand Prix series, but this time he withdrew from competition for seven months due to complications with diabetes, becoming permanently disabled in 1977. In 1973 Milén was featured in the special `` All-American Vacation '' photo album for Terry Winwood, who was invited by his grandmother to present the United States Grand Prix classifications to Milén's grandfather in New York City.

 Daubrée was born at Metz , and educated at the École Polytechnique in Paris .   
 At the age of twenty he had qualified as a mining engineer , and in 1838 he was appointed to take charge of the mines in the Bas-Rhin ( Alsace ) , and subsequently to be professor of mineralogy and geology at the Faculty of Sciences , Strasbourg . In 1859 he became engineer in chief of mines , and in 1861 , upon the death of Louis Cordier , he was appointed professor of geology at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris and was also elected member of the French Academy of Sciences . In the following year he became professor of mineralogy at the École des Mines , and in 1872 director of that school . In 1878 Daubrée was elected vice-president and in 1879 president of the French Academy of Sciences . In 1880 the Geological Society of London awarded to him the Wollaston medal . In 1881 he was promoted to Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour.His published researches date from 1841 , when the origin of certain tin minerals attracted his attention ; he subsequently discussed the formation of bog-iron ore , and worked out in detail the geology of the Bas-Rhin ( 1852 ) . From 1857 to 1861 , while engaged in engineering works connected with the springs of Plombieres , he made a series of interesting observations on thermal waters and their influence on the Roman masonry through which they made their exit . He was , however , especially distinguished for his long-continued and often dangerous experiments on the artificial production of minerals and rocks . He likewise discussed the permeability of rocks by water , and the effects of such infiltration in producing volcanic phenomena ; he dealt with the subject of metamorphism , with the deformations of the Earth 's crust , with earthquakes , and with the composition and classification of meteorites.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1881 , a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892 , and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1895.He died in Paris on 29 May 1896 .

This effect describes the photodiodes, the crystalline materials that conduct light. It is the first known photodiodemic structure. His daughter Elena Corra was also a physicist.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Corra was born in Milan. He was a university student at the University of Bologna, where he studied mathematics and physics.  
 His interest in research began in 1897 when he attended lectures given by Professor Mio Correa. In the same year, Corra studied by contact with Elektor George Steinbeck in Königsberg. Corra came to the conclusion that early childhood education should be given to children who were involved with art, especially drawing.  
 In 1905 Corra became an assistant in Correa's Physics Department, and he was among the first students to introduce the use of biometrical measurements as a basis for teaching mathematics and physics. With Correa as head of the Department, he led research that resulted in the measurement of the amplitude of electric discharges, through over the colliding contacts on ferromagnetic quartz crystals. In 1906 Corra discovered the Corra force, a counter-intuitive effect that clearly accounts for the Corra effect and was the first to establish a direct relationship between the intensity of an electric current and the contact size of the crystal. Also, in 1906, Corra showed that this force does not depend on the diameter of the crystal, nor on the strength of the contact with a surface. In addition, Corra found the prototype image projector during this time, also called `` Corra sheet '', which remained in use for many years.  
 Corra also contributed to the development of the metric system.Corra worked in one of Correa's Ph.D. departmental laboratories at the University of Milan and as an assistant in Leopoldina's Physics department. His early work was dedicated to optical quantum mechanics, which led him to the discovery of the Corra effect and the Maxwell–Zirkel effect. In 1910 Corra became an assistant professor in Rome, Italy, where he continued to take important direct part in student work and in World War I. He then moved to America where he taught mathematics and physics to employees at the universities of Colorado and Yale.At the Institute for Optics in Bologna, Corra identified the reactance of electrical resistances that acted upon plates of superconducting material. In 1916 he showed that a voltage drop in a superconductor provided a significant component of the Corra effect. From 1918 until his death, Corra worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Bologna, where he was one of the founders of the new department of physics and quantum mechanics. He also received an honorary Doctorate in 1954 from the University of Padova. His scientific achievements are known in multiple media. Since 1937, he has been an editor of a number of scientific journals.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Corra's reputation is held with the name Corra iron, and his important contributions in the physics of superconductivity are still relatively few and fundamental today. Corra was well known in physics education and he was instrumental in recruiting and retaining young graduate students. His achievements are complemented by his legendary students. Among them were physicist Vittorio Sagme. The bronze statue of Corra in the University of Bologna's Institute for Optical Materials in Pisa and the academic streets of Rome are named after him.He was active in scientific societies, and he was elected as president of the Italian Association for Scientific Research and the Scientific Committee on Physics.

Valentin Berlinsky ( January 19 , 1925 – December 15 , 2008 ) was a Russian cellist . He was a member of the world-famous Borodin Quartet in 1945 and was a member until 2007 . He was the only Quartet member to have played in it from the beginning . Berlinsky played for the Borodin Quartet for 60 years , making him the longest-serving member of what The New York Times described as being `` by all accounts the longest continuously playing '' string quartet in the world.The group originally came together in 1945 as the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet with Mstislav Rostropovich on cello , Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai on first and second violins and Rudolf Barshai on viola , all members of a class taken by Mikhail Terian , the viola player of the Comitas Quartet . However , after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy and nominated Berlinsky in his place . They signed an oath of allegiance in their own blood which Berlinsky retained . He also maintained a complete log of their many performances.The quartet first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946 and became his interpreter . The group was known for its performances of all 15 quartets in the Shostakovich quartet cycle at concert halls around the world , including in 1994 at Alice Tully Hall in New York City.The quartet was one of the Soviet Union 's best known in the West during the Cold War era , through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings . As one of the most revered groups during the Communist era , the quartet performed at the funerals of both Joseph Stalin and Sergei Prokofiev , who both died on March 5 , 1953.After 20 years with the same line-up difficult times followed in the 1970s : Dubinsky emigrated to the West in 1976 and the second violinist , Jaroslav Alexandrov , retired through ill-health . Having recruited replacements , Berlinsky insisted that the ensemble spend two years out of sight until the Borodin sound had been fully recreated.Berlinsky was a very loyal Russian . In 2000 he said : `` I have never condemned those who left . It 's difficult to describe in words why I stayed , but for me it was nothing to do with cheap patriotism . It was just that Russia is my fatherland ; I could n't imagine living anywhere else . '' For much of his life he taught at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow , nurturing many talented young players.Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk , Siberia , on January 19 , 1925 . He took violin lessons from his father , who had been a pupil of Leopold Auer and who , with his three brothers , played as the Berlinsky Quartet in that part of the Soviet Union . He was soon sent to Moscow to study at the Moscow Conservatory . He had one daughter , Ludmila Valentinovna Berlinskaya .   
 Valentin Berlinsky retired from the Borodin Quartet in September 2007 , and was succeeded by his protégé , Vladimir Balshin , but he still remained the group 's mentor.Berlinsky died at age 83 on the night of December 15 , 2008 , in Moscow , after a long illness.The quartet 's oath and the complete list of their performances together with chronological events taken from his own diaries were compiled and edited by his granddaughter , Maria Matalaev , and his biography published in Valentin Berlinsky : A Quartet for Life ( 2018 ) .

He was the second child of two sons of Lev Dynytsky, who was a teacher and historian of science. One of his brothers, Nikolai Dynytsky, became a well-known Soviet leader and was later executed by the Red Army as a war criminal in 1945. A third son, Boris Dynytsky, was born in 1921.  
 His younger brother Boris Dynytsky was a young scientist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Dynytsky was born in Ushavnoye, Saint Petersburg, Russia, the only child of Lev Dynytsky and Maria Alexeyeva. His parents were neither divorced nor legally separated and were never married. He did not receive formal schooling, but spent his childhood at home working at his father's factory. He left school in his early twenties for college at the University of Saint Petersburg, graduating in 1942. After graduation, he worked at the Sverdlovsk Scientific Laboratory as a physicist. He obtained a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Moscow University in 1945. He then taught at the Moscow State University Medical Institute in 1951. In 1952 he began studying at Imperial College in London, working with Filippo Avramopoulos. He was appointed head of the medical laboratory of the city in 1956, then moved to Saint Petersburg to work with other PhDs in biochemistry. He had already begun to study human carcinogenicity by 1953, which led to his recommendation to Moscow State University, where he was a professor from 1970 to 1981. Dynytsky was a highly regarded researcher, known for his work with various aspects of cancer metabolism. He pioneered new methods of isotopic analyses of carcinogens, which allowed scientists to use them to study the effect of exposure to carcinogens on human physiology. He was named Director of the Laboratory of Biology at Imperial College in 1980. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1971. In 1975 he received the Stalin Prize, the highest honor in Soviet science. He was succeeded by his younger brother Vasily Pyatakov.

Adriaan Loosjes ( 1761 , in Texel – 1818 , in Haarlem ) , was a 19th-century botanist , poet , novelist and publisher born in Den Hoorn , North Holland , Netherlands .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He came from a family of Mennonite ministers and was an active member of the Doopsgezinde kerk , Haarlem , where he started his first literary society in 1777 , Honos alit artes . In 1779 he started another one called Vlijt moeder der Wetenschappen that began to annually announce contests with a prize similar to the Teylers Eerste Genootschap that was founded the year before . In 1782 these two societies were merged and also began to produce plays , which Loosjes wrote , acted , and published himself , becoming a Haarlem bookseller . In the same year Jan van Walré joined to become an actor , and under his influence , in 1785 the society was reinvented as the theater society Leerzaam vermaak with a strong Patriotic bias with Loosjes and Walré the leaders . When the House of Orange briefly enjoyed a contrarevolution , Leerzaam vermaak was banned , and Loosjes decided to avoid politics and relinquished his official roles in the group , spending his time on scientific and writing pursuits . In 1789 he started the Haarlem scientific society Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen . To continue with his comedies , he began the society Democriet in the same year with the remark Because Heraclitus had to cry , Democritus had to laugh . In 1790 Walré joined , who again added political color , despite Loosjes ' intentions to remain neutral . In 1795 when the French occupation began , the activities of Democriet reached their peak , and after that moment the society began to show similarities with freemasonry.Loosjes wrote several books and plays , and translated historical works from English into Dutch . He succeeded his father Petrus Loosjes as a member of Teylers Eerste Genootschap from 1813 until his own death in 1818 . His son Vincent Loosjes continued his publishing business .

Jesse Macy ( June 21 , 1842 – November 2 , 1919 ) was an American political scientist and historian of the late 19th and early 20th century , specializing in the history of American political parties , party systems , and the Civil War . He spent most of his professional career at his alma mater , Grinnell College .   
 Jesse Macy , the thirteenth of fourteen children , was born to Quaker parents in Indiana , but the family moved to central Iowa in 1856 and started farming outside Lynnville , near the newly founded town of Grinnell . At age 17 , he entered Iowa College , now Grinnell College . During the Civil War , he served in the Union army and he did not graduate until after the war , earning an A.B . in 1870.During the 1870s , Macy started what would become a long-term correspondence with James Bryce , a noted British jurist and politician . In 1884 , he completed his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University . The next year , he returned to the Midwest to take a professorship at Iowa College . For the next forty-two years , Macy taught history and political science at the college.In the 1890s , Macy defended radical aspects of the burgeoning social gospel taught at Iowa College by professor of Applied Christianity George Herron and college president George A . Gates . Macy supported liberal education in a newspaper article , saying :   
    
 Suppose some emissary of darkness had spied out our liberty and had arraigned Iowa College before the public as a place where young people were taught the dangerous doctrine of evolution . It may be that at so early a date the young professors would have been sent adrift and the public would have been assured that Iowa College was a place where only safe opinions were allowed ! That is a place where only imbeciles and hypocrites are educated .   
 He was also a leading author of political science textbooks . Macy 's 1896 manual on American civil government , Our Government . How It Grew , What It Does , And How it Does It , was an influential primer for university students and his 1897 The English Constitution : A Commentary on its Nature and Growth was acclaimed for providing the necessary foundation in English law to correctly understand American law.In his 1904 work Party Organization and Machinery Macy wrote , `` While our party system is without Old World models , it is strikingly in harmony with our other forms of political activity ... . '' and `` Various references to party and faction found in The Federalist illustrate the type of American ideas which prevailed before the American party system appeared '' ( pp . xiv-xvi ) . The work also included a whole chapter entitled `` Effect of the City upon the Party System '' .   
 In 1911 , Grinnell awarded Macy an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.After retiring in 1912 , Macy traveled widely and continued writing until his death in 1919.In February 2008 , Grinnell 's board of trustees voted to name one of the college office buildings `` Jesse Macy House '' in memory of the long-serving professor . The building , at 1205 Park St. , houses a number of interdisciplinary centers , including the Center for Peace Studies and the Rosenfield Program.Macy 's descendants include SLAC physicist H. Pierre Noyes .

 He was born in Halle-Wittenberg, and studied mathematics, natural sciences, and natural history at the University of Königsberg.  
 He then worked at the Herder-Schule at Stettin. In 1848 he went to London to be a teacher and assistant in entomology, and from 1851 to 1854 he worked for the Linnaean Society of London. Braun was the first entomologist to describe two species of Sphenochima, which are now not to be confused with the Diptera of today. Braun wrote a popular book, the Feldbuch der Schmetterländern ( Complete Guide to Insects, 1861 ), with P. Imhof and H. Cressens in 1859. Braun's works about the animals and molluscs of the United Kingdom helped facilitate the founding of the Entomological Society of London in 1863. In 1866 Braun was invited to take charge of the newly formed Museum Entomologisch-Bund in Geneva.  
 Braun started a career as a taxonomist in his native land, also helping to establish the Entomological Society of Graz, Austria. In 1873, Braun became the first director of the new Siboga Museum in Graz. Braun also continued to teach at the University of Berlin.

 = Carl von Brun =  
Carl von Brun ( December 7, 1840 in Bienkirchen – August 4, 1928 in Stuttgart ) was a German composer and teacher.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born into a musical family in the small hamlet of Schaumburg-Stuttgart, Brun was already considered an active composer when he entered the Hochschule für Musik und Orchester Nuremberg. His early contributions to violin playing were counterpoint and the choral pieces.  
 In 1850, he succeeded August Walther ( d. 1879 ) as professor of chamber music at the University of Stuttgart and in 1852 became assistant at the newly founded Conservatorium in Bremen, which he moved to after Walther's death. During this period, Brun was a member of the Berlin group of the Paris Conférence of Music and had become an active member of the Society of Jesus, the educational society founded by Saint James the Less. In 1858 Brun founded the State Music Center in Leipzig, where he was an enthusiastic proponent of Dixieland.  
 In 1859, he established the Kirche Konzertlerverein ( Kreisstudium ) in Heidelberg where, under the leadership of Friedrich Weber, he founded a literary music school. This initiative was a classic example of the fusion between classical music and the literary medium of music.  
 For his acclaimed organ concerto Les Prix-Roches de Cadet and his editions of Dvořák's Overture to Beethoven's Variations on a Plain for Piano, 1880 and 1881, Brun was awarded the Košice award of the Royal Philharmonic Society.  
 In 1884 Brun was elected member of the Academy of Music in Berlin, and for a short time until his death in 1928 was a member of the board of directors of the German Archaeological Society.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
   
 In addition to his important organ concertos, Brun composed numerous choral works. He was a strong advocate of harmonic idiom, a move which he elaborated in his Leitmotif. In 1869 he published, for the first time, a version of the piano concerto Scarlatti's 8 d'Eclair, presented in F major.  
 Brun's Symphony in A Minor, op. 21, is an influential French suite dedicated to a friend of his at the Kirche Konzertlerverein, Johann Johann Friedrich Gartenberg, whose father, Hans Gartenberg, also performed the Russian Revolution Overture to Requiem.  
 Among Brun's other important piano choral works are :  
   
 Fortuna, in 3 movements, op. 25 ( issued 1891 as Leipzig Suite )  
 Concerto amore, op. 31, for piano

Sir Jack Hibbert ( 14 February 1932 – 23 August 2005 ) was a British statistician and director of the Central Statistical Office ( CSO ) of the United Kingdom , 1985–1992 . He was made a KCB in 1990 .   
    
    
 == Background ==   
 Sir Jack Hibbert was born in Huddersfield , Yorkshire , on 14 February 1932 . He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and the London School of Economics and was married with two sons and one daughter . He died on 23 August 2005 in Weybridge , Surrey .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Hibbert joined the Exchequer and Audit Department in 1952 and then moved to the Central Statistical Office in 1960 , where he worked on economics statistics . He was promoted to chief statistician in 1970 and to assistant director in 1977 . In 1981 , he spent a period on loan to the OECD and to Eurostat as a consultant and then joined the Department of Trade and Industry as a director of statistics . On 1 August 1985 , he was appointed director of the Central Statistical Office in succession to Sir John Boreham . He retired in 1992 .   
    
    
 == Central Statistical Office ==   
 When Jack Hibbert took over the CSO , it had suffered four years of cutbacks following the 'Rayner Review ' of official statistics . Shortly after this , the then Chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson , and other Conservative politicians claimed that misleading statistics were largely responsible for the Government 's poor handling of the economy . The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee recommended ' a thorough review into the operation of various Departments involved in the collection of national accounts statistics ' . The review , by Stephen Pickford , recommended that there should be just one organisation responsible for the collection and compilation of statistics for national accounts .   
 This meant moving the Business Statistics Office and responsibility for data on imports and exports from the Department of Trade and Industry , and responsibility for the Retail Prices Index from the Department of Employment . The changes , in July 1989 , increased the CSO from just under 170 staff to about 1,000 . This was probably the biggest shake-up of official statistics since the creation of the CSO in 1941 . Jack Hibbert had the difficult job of creating this new organisation .

 == Biography ==  
 He was the son of a physician, Isaac Rollen, by his first wife, the younger Anna Osborne ( née Hamilton ). He was born in 9 August 1691, and came of a noble family of Wiltshire and Scotland. As a boy, he moved around between his father's estates, mostly in the provinces, taking occasional walks and walks in the country. He went to the Lyceum in London. On 27 January 1696, he married Lorna Atkins, daughter of Robert Goodby Atkins, and left London on 16 May. While the family were there he was apprenticed to Dr. Norman Goodby, the Professor of Anatomy in the University College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, to whom he became very intimate, for the sake of his education, in health, and for lectures and journeys, and who made a great exertion to take him on board the `` Parrott '' at the beginning of the year 1703. He was immediately appointed to a state visit to Japan in 1709.  
 He was appointed a lecturer of anatomical anatomy in the University College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1708, and was the first, in 1711, to lecture on `` Characteristics of the Liver '' and `` Medulla oblongata ''.  
 On 31 May 1716, he was admitted to the practice of physiology at Edinburgh University. He was the author of a treatise, Memoir on the Symptoms of the Nervous System ( Edinburgh, 1720 ), which in a brief tract includes such details as the physiology of our heart, as a farmer might well expect, his observations on the geology of Strathmore, and a discussion on the life-giving powers of wine and ale.  
 In 1719 he received the Royal Medal from the Institution of Physicians. In 1721, he was elected president of the newly created Society of Physicians of the United Kingdom. On 4 September 1724, he was invited to become a doctor in the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the only professorial post open in the English Universities at that time.

 Zeisel was born in Kadaň , Bohemia in 1905 , and soon afterward moved with his family to Vienna , Austria , where he grew up . He received his doctorates in law and political science from the University of Vienna in 1927 .   
    
    
 == Early career ==   
 After receiving his doctorates , Zeisel worked with Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda on the 1933 study Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal , which David Kaye has called `` a celebrated study of the impact of the Depression and unemployment on a small Austrian town . '' Similarly , University of Chicago professor Friedrich Katz said of Marienthal that `` The book had a profound effect , not only in Austria , but everywhere '' . Also after graduating from the University of Vienna , he practiced law and engaged in pro-socialism activism until 1938 , when he emigrated to New York City in response to the Anschluss Österreichs . In New York , he became influential in the fields of media market research , and his research in these areas led to the 1947 statistics book Say It with Figures .

 Zeisel joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1953 to study the American jury system with Harry Kalven . The research Zeisel and Kalven conducted on the jury system produced two books : Delay in the Court ( 1959 ) and The American Jury . After retiring from the University of Chicago , he continued conducting research , especially on capital punishment ( of which he was a firm opponent ) and trademark infringement . In 1977 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association . One of the last works he wrote discussed the limits of using statistical methods to study the legal system . This book was posthumously published in 1997 as Prove It with Figures .

Konstantin Petrovich Feoktistov ( Russian : Константин Петрович Феоктистов ; 7 February 1926 – 21 November 2009 ) was a Soviet cosmonaut and an eminent space engineer . Feoktistov also wrote several books on space technology and exploration . The Feoktistov crater on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 During the Nazi occupation of Voronezh , at the age of just 16 , Feoktistov fought with the Soviet Army against the German troops , carrying out reconnaissance missions for the Voronezh Front . After being captured by a Waffen-SS Army patrol , Feoktistov was shot by a German officer . However , the bullet went right through his chin and neck and did not kill him . Feoktistov was able to crawl out later and then make his way to the Soviet lines .   
 After the war was over , Feoktistov enrolled in the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as an engineering student and he graduated in 1949 . Feoktistov also later earned a doctorate in physics . He joined Mikhail Tikhonravov 's OKB ( design bureau ) , and in 1955 , Feoktistov formed part of the team that went on to design the Sputnik satellites , the Vostok space capsule , the Voskhod space capsule , and the Soyuz space capsule under the leadership of the Soviet Chief Designer Sergey Korolev . During this time , Feoktistov also worked on a design for an ion-propelled spacecraft to be capable of taking humans to Mars .   
 In 1964 , Feoktistov was selected as part of a group of engineers for cosmonaut training , and in October of that very same year , he was hastily assigned to the multi-disciplinary Voskhod 1 crew . He was the first civilian to make a space flight , and the only cosmonaut in the Soviet Union who was not a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . During his space flight , he spent just over 24 hours and 17 minutes in space.After the flight of Voskhod 1 , Feoktistov 's training for any further space mission was discontinued for medical reasons . However , Feoktistov continued his outer space engineering work , and he later became the head of the Soviet space design bureau that designed the Salyut and Mir space stations .   
 In October 1969 , Konstantin Feoktistov and Georgi Beregovoi traveled as guests of NASA throughout the US , visiting any city they chose and Disneyland in California – they were joined on the trip by US astronauts as hosts , including Eugene Cernan , Neil Armstrong and others . Kirk Douglas and others hosted receptions for them in Hollywood – they were protected by special agents of the US State Department on request of NASA . Almost every place they went when accompanied by Eugene Cernan , if a band was present the song `` Fly Me to the Moon '' was played – when they visited Disneyland they enjoyed the ride Trip To The Moon , then joked with the US astronauts that they went to Disneyland and not the moon . It was a trip that all enjoyed and international friendships were made .   
 Feoktistov resigned from his engineering position with Energia and then returned to Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as a professor in 1990 .

 = D. C. Moorhead =  
Derek Curtis Moorhead, DSC ( 1920-2001 ) was an Australian philosopher, known for developing the techniques of his later doctoral studies. His topics include black-chamber ethics, the 'open question'hypothesis, and neuroscience.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Moorhead was born in Heidelberg, the son of a college graduate. After leaving school at the age of 16, Moorhead began study of mathematics and physics at the University of Cambridge and won a first class PhD under Martin Heidegger, who was a student there. At the age of 27, Moorhead was hired to write the book Prolegomena to Husserl's Analyse der Phenomenologie ( 1948 ), a first-hand account of phenomenology. To earn extra money for this work, Moorhead began lecturing and also lecturing on phenomenology, for which he received a degree in Philosophy from Cambridge. In 1955, Moorhead married Cleo Bennett, and together they lived in Melbourne. Moorhead's interest in phenomenology began later that year when he read Husserl's Grundrisse under Karl Barth's supervision, for which he received his Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D. ) in 1956, his first doctorate of philosophy. Moorhead lived at 30 Mary Street on 20 July 1957. At this time, Moorhead also began to write on phenomenology, specifically the 'open question'hypothesis. Moorhead's own research, for example, resulted in the development of the method he developed to study this hypothesis, or `` grey-Chamber ethics '', which he developed and explained in his papers and doctoral thesis, entitled Analysis der phenomenologie. As a consequence of this work, he was, at the time, also in the top ten academicians in the world according to the US Encyclopedia of Philosophy. When he was 40 years old, Moorhead published a collection of essays titled Ataraxia Philosophiae : Calumny, Relevance and Exegesis, which details his interest in the philosophy of concepts, especially in discussing ontology and quantum mechanics. With his daughter Cleo he later developed two radio programs for the ABC, “ Ataraxia Philosophy and “ Ataraxia Radio ”.Derek Moorhead was an honorary fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.  
   
   
 == Trial and death ==  
 Moorhead was brought to the stand by the defense team for his murder trial. A book about Moorhead was produced by A.C. Dutton and was printed in the Australian newspaper The Age. The book was published after a short period of legal wrangling, with the evident intention that it would allow him to have a successful trial. Following the tragic murder of his wife Cleo Moorhead, who had also been murdered and whose body was found in his house, Dutton persuaded the jury to spare the former law student. The publisher informed the prosecutor of the decision and, on the advice of John Drew and a legal adviser, Moorhead committed suicide by taking a bullet in the head.

 = Silvia Capone =  
Silvia Capone ( October 1, 1842 – June 4, 1927 ) was an Italian-American psychologist and professor who studied evolutionary psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Silvia Capone was born in Bologna, Italy. She received an elementary education in Florence, where she became a pupil of Giuseppe Maria Rusti. She married John Cresson Parnell, an Irish-American, on July 28, 1878. She was at her father's side in Illinois and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1889-1891. She then received a Ph.D. in Psychology and Education from the University of Chicago in 1897. She taught at the University of Chicago, for four years, from 1899 to 1902, before moving to the Department of Psychology at Illinois in 1903. She taught there until 1927, when she died.  
 Capone studied phenomenology of mind, facial expressions, and the anatomy of the eye as well as the study of emotions and perceptions. She also studied various disciplines of mind and behavior, and received research funding from the National Institutes of Health. She used the term evolution as a synonym for `` perceptual expansion ''.  
 She was the only female professor at the University of Illinois, and the only one to lead a department of her own.  
 In 1925, Capone published a small book, Studies in Evolutionary Psychology. It is one of the few books on evolutionary psychology published in the United States before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, and the first to discuss `` scientific material '' from evolutionary perspectives. Other works of Capone included : The Mystery of Pleasure ( 1894 ) ; The Language of Desire ( 1898 ) ; Reflections on Beauty, No. 2 ( 1905 ) ; Outline of the Concepts of Desire ( 1907 ) ; Why Did Nature Make Chicks? ( 1913 ) ; and Variation of Sex. In those writings, Capone distinguishes between `` evolved '' and `` antecedent '' notions of sex, as well as describing her career as a teacher and researcher and the psychological theory of social evolution.

 = Franklin Lois Jensen =  
Franklin Lois Jensen ( March 29, 1898 – May 9, 1978 ) was a pioneer researcher in biology. He pioneered studies on the transmission of viruses from one generation to another.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jensen was born in Portland, Oregon. His father owned a small soap factory and early schooling was poorly attended. He got into homeopathic medicine, graduating in 1922. In 1927, he left homeopathic medicine to go to Columbia University. A research assistant there, Bernice La Salle, introduced him to genetics and vaccination. In 1924, Jensen joined the Somerville Institute in New York City, working with Joan Greer, in collaboration with scientist Albert Hoffman.  
 In 1935, Jensen and Greer developed the peptide virus A. From 1947 to 1953, he was the Distinguished Professor of Genetics at Columbia University.  
 After retirement, Jensen continued to collaborate with other researchers and the Bundestag in their efforts to develop polio vaccines, and was an early advocate for the laboratory-based treatment of children with polio. In 1955, the institute he founded, which he called Genetics Laboratory of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was renamed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.In the late 1940s, after receiving a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, he went to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research ( now the Rockefeller University ) in New York City on the study of bacteria, viruses and other emerging infectious agents. Jensen was the head of the laboratory, which he left with the institute in 1946 to focus on radiation-induced mutations of genes that appeared in bacteria. In 1948, he received the Diamant Chabard Chair in Viral Biology at the Rockefeller Institute.  
 In 1951, Jensen's research group performed the first direct sequencing of the influenza virus. This `` FASEB-X '' program was the first time that a large database of microorganisms, viruses and genes was used to build the human immunodeficiency virus vaccine. Also in 1951, in collaboration with Charles Trumbull, he proposed an integrated design of the ABC virus assay to allow for the detection of as yet untested inactivated antibodies. The vaccination trial known as the Vaccine Trial of 1955 demonstrated that the vaccine had virus effectiveness over the time period of about 4 years. Jensen began working at the Rockefeller Institute as a visiting scholar, and later the director, in 1957. During this period, he also published a paper titled, `` The Replication of the H5N1 B virus '' ( `` Daily Life of an Aerobic Hemagglutinin-Steroid '' ). In 1954, he published on how infectious bacteria ( H5N1 ) polysaccharide glycoprotein ( GS ) can infect nerve cells. Jensen's findings led to the discovery that CSF droplets could contain pathogens that elicit a rabies bite in the mouse, and this research helped inform the isolation of the virus from blood and saliva of some experimental experimental rabies virus carriers. He had pioneered efforts to find genes involved in generating and directing H5N1 infection and helped pioneer the vaccine.In 1955, Jensen went to work at Massachusetts General Hospital where he was president of the National Advisory Committee for Immunization and Infectious Disease. In 1961, he became a full-time associate professor at the Rockefeller Institute and held the same position until his retirement in 1985.

 = Thomas Obicini =   
Thomas Obicini of Novara ( Italian : Tomasso Obicini da Novara ; 1585 – 7 November 1632 ) was a Franciscan friar , originally from Novara , Italy . As an early orientalist , Arabist and linguist , he translated Arabic texts into Latin and took possession of the Grotto of Nazareth for the Franciscan order in 1620 .   
    
    
 == Journey to Nazareth ==   
 In 1620 Fra Obicini 's travelled to Jerusalem to the Emir of Beirut , Fakhr ad-Din II .   
 The background to this mission began seven years earlier , in 1613 , when Fakhr ad-Din II had taken refuge in Tuscany , Italy . The emir formed an alliance with the Medici ruler , Cosimo II , and spent two years under his protection . He spent three more in Sicily and Naples seeking , and failing , to rally a Crusade against Ottoman rule . By 1618 the changed political situation permitted his return to Lebanon .   
 Two years later Friar Obicini journeyed to Jerusalem in an embassy with Lord Battista Tarquet , the Consul of all Palestine , sent by the consul of Sidon , the Christian King , Lord Albert Gardana and the Prosecutor of the Holy Land , Lord Francis Lebar .   
 In Beirut , Obicini was , according to his account , warmly and lavishly received by the emir ad-Din , who had readily granted the two Christian holy sites , the Grotto of the Annunciation , i.e . the Grotto of Nazareth , and Mount Tabor to his Franciscan order .   
 In his description of the acquisition of the holy sites he recounts how he travelling to Nazareth , as a small group of a priest , friar John of Vendôme , and a Sicilian friar , Francesco Salice , had brought letters from the Princes , various testimonials , and a decree from the Qadi of Safed . On Saturday 29 November 1620 , the group took possession of the sanctuary built on the foundations of the House of Loreto and known as the Holy Grotto - the site venerated by Christians as the place where the Angel Gabriel announced the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary.While Obicini was abbot in the convent of Aleppo , Syria he had mastered Syriac , Arabic , Hebrew , Aramaic , and Coptic languages . In 1621 , he was the first lector in Arabic in the San Pietro in Montorio convent and was a precursor of Athanasius Kircher .   
 In 1631 Obicini published Grammatica Arabica ; a Latin translation of the 13th-14th century Arabic grammar Matn Al Ajrumiyyah , ( إلاجرُومِية ) , by Abū Abdullaahi Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Dāwūd aṣ-Ṣanhaajī , known as Ibn Adjurrum .   
 In 1636 Obicini published Thesaurus Arabico-Syro-Latinus , his opus magnum ; a Latin expanded translation of Elijah of Nisibis 's 11th-century glossary intended to assist Latin-speaking prelates in converting Syrians and other Arabic speakers .

 = Abraham C. Gubel =  
Abraham Abba Gubel ( German : [ ˈahbubʁi ] ; 12 October 1916 – 9 July 2005 ) was a 19th-century German mathematician. Gubel is considered one of the greatest of all pure functional algebraists.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Gubel's parents were parents of two Jewish immigrants from eastern Galicia, Russian-Jewish Albert and Carrie Gubel. His maternal grandmother, Louisa Orten, was born in Austria. Her father was born in the Russian Empire. Albert was born in Germany and his mother in Heidelberg.  
   
 Gubel studied at the University of Halle and received his PhD in 1927 at the age of twenty-four. In 1930, Gubel accepted a position as a lecturer at the University of Heidelberg. This included a position on Bayes–Klein problems with Jacques Bayes.  
 Gubel became an assistant professor in 1937 at Heidelberg. During this time he married Marie Henriette ( Klindt ) Gubel, who was also a mathematician. The couple had four children : two daughters and two sons. After teaching at the University of Heidelberg for thirty years, Gubel retired in 1983. He died in Switzerland in 2005.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Gubel is considered to be the greatest of all pure functional algebras. He was the first to suggest the existence of `` non-atomeals '', i.e., non-decidable topological extensions to sets with spaces of nonzero numbers, as well as the existence of prime sub-sets of the product of modulo and associativity in odd-dimensional spaces.  
 In 1961, he co-authored with Theodore Boak with K. Vassiliev with `` Functions of a Different Algebraic Type '', a series of nine papers on an enumeration language ( the H-1 theorem ) that introduced the concept of permutations and permutation classes. He also contributed papers on algebraic topology, set theory, topological unification, determinants and independence, p-adic numbers, discontinuities, generalized abelian numbers, geometry, the theory of cohomology, and the geometry of sums.  
 Gubel was the founder and first editor of Algebraic Statistics ( eBASE ), and was the father of mathematician-geometricians Elena Efimov and Hans Gubel.

He was famous for emphasizing that the physical demands of most violin techniques can be taught ( `` in embryonic form '' ) in the first two years of violin education . He advocated that teachers learn and teach freedom of movement and use clear , specific and concise instructions when teaching . His approach to pedagogy was extremely analytical , and his teaching approach was highly systematic and logical . His wife said of his work `` Every possible movement in string playing was analyzed ... . Different methods do indeed exist , but none more fundamental ... . Paul never harmed anyone 's playing . He helped a person through certain body movements and the knowledge of what those body movements meant physically , in the scientific way of playing the violin . `` [ Cite ]

She graduated from Manchester University with a B.Sc . in 1938 , M.Sc . in 1939 and a Ph.D. in Physics in 1946 . She was a research student in Cambridge from 1945 and a Tucker-Price Research Fellow of Girton College , Cambridge from 1946 to 1949 . She married Malcolm Nicolson , also a physicist , in 1942 and had two sons . The family moved to Leeds where Malcolm Nicolson was appointed to a lectureship in Physics at Leeds University . Malcolm Nicolson died accidentally in 1951 , and Phyllis was appointed to take over his lectureship . In 1955 , she married physicist Malcolm McCaig by whom she had another son . She died from breast cancer in 1968 in Sheffield .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 During her time in Manchester , Nicolson worked with Douglas Hartree and became a proficient numerical analyst and an expert user of Hartree 's differential analyser . Nicolson initially worked on cosmic ray problems , but after the outbreak of war Hartree 's differential analyser group pursued defence-related problems . Two of the problems in her thesis are derived from work done for the Ministry of Supply . One of these problems was on solutions of the heat equation , and with her colleague John Crank she investigated the numerical stability of several solution techniques . The algorithm now known as the Crank–Nicolson method emerged from this work and was published in 1947 .

Wilbur Rutherford ( 1854–1921 ) was an American crystallographer and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Rutherford was born in Salem, New Hampshire. In 1888, he attended The New York Academy of Sciences in New York City and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree there in 1894. He was a student of Professor Samuel Bell ( 1825–1888 ), who was working on his education at the Academy when he became interested in crystallography. Rutherford decided to study law, but he returned to his undergraduate studies at the Academy to complete the degree requirements. After graduating with a BA degree in 1897, Rutherford worked for thirty years as an assistant to Professor Edmond Lee Kinch, a crystallographer and illustrator for the NY Academy. In 1917, he became an instructor and one of the founding faculty members of the Department of Crystallography at Columbia University.After retiring in 1936, Rutherford continued to give lectures and was a member of the Division of Crystal Genetics at Harvard University until his death in 1921. He received the Agnes E. Hasse Memorial Medal from the American Society of Crystallography.  
   
   
 == Theology ==  
 Rutherford's chief interest was in the Christian God and Old Testament revelation. Although he considered himself primarily a Biblical scholar and a personal friend of S. F. Rinehart, who was Rutherford's classmate in Columbia, Rutherford's theology was shaped by a lifelong study of deism and was influenced by Aristotelian philosophy. He explored and produced the theosophical groupings and monistic dimensions in his contributions to the deistic group. His first book was Deism in America. He became a member of the Carl E. Schmitt Academy of Religion in Boston in 1915, and a member of the New York Academy in 1924. Rutherford married Sarah Jane Donlan in 1893.

 == Early life ==   
 Charles was the son of Charles Burney , Paymaster Chief Royal Navy , and his wife Eleanor Norton , daughter of the Rev . W. A. Norton , rector of Alderton and Eye , Suffolk . He was educated at Merchant Taylors ' School , and St John 's College , Oxford .

 Burney published several works on biblical history . In Israel 's settlement in Canaan , he brought much new or newly applied material , especially from Babylonian sources , to explain Israel 's early residence in Canaan . A major contribution was the theory that Yahweh ( Jehovah ) was at an early period an Amorite deity . In The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel he attempted to prove that St John 's Gospel was a literal Greek translation of a Gospel written in Aramaic by a Jewish disciple , and this at least led to an accepted view that the author thought in Aramaic , and strengthened the probability that it was the work of an eyewitness .

 In 1913 at the age of 45 he married Ethel Wordsworth Madan ( 1891–1984 ) , the elder daughter of Falconer Madan and his wife Frances Hayter .

Together Moss and Burney continued the work that had been started by Bertha Porter ( with Moss as her assistant ) in the early 1920s on the Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts , Reliefs , and Paintings . 'The Two Ladies ' as they were known travelled throughout the Middle East and the rest of the world until the late 1960s visiting digs , museums and collections , and gathering data for the many volumes of the Topographical Bibliography that they produced together with a small team of collaborators.Charles and Ethel 's daughter , Venetia Phair , is famed for proposing the name Pluto for the erstwhile planet , at the age of 11 .

 He was Director of the Vienna Natural History Museum .   
 Holdhaus worked on the Coleoptera of glacial refugia , postglacial range expansions and “ Massifs de Refugium ” . He recognised that the distribution of blind euedaphic and troglobitic beetles is restricted to a well definable area in Europe , south of a line connecting Bordeaux , Lyon , the southern Alps , the Carpathians and the Black Sea . This is the “ Holdhaus line ” - the northern distribution limit of beetles with very poor powers of dispersal , especially blind cave beetles . Only two small areas with blind beetles are known north of this line the Jura and the Northeastern Alps ) .Also South of this line there are many endemic animal and These areas are the “ Massifs de Refugium ” of Chodat & Pampanini ( 1902 ) .

 In 1977, he became Professor of the Anatomy of Biological Systems at the University of Haifa, succeeding Omar Aydi. He was the chairman of the department of physics and was also a member of various Israeli academic societies.  
 In the 1980s, as a critic of policies of the then Israeli government, in his famous article `` The destruction of the Palestinian Left '', published in the Talmud, Hermani declared that his goal was to reduce the autonomy and cultural and ideological inferiority of Palestinians, in order to reform the Palestinian nation. In Israel, he formed the faction, People's Power, which had strong anti-Zionist and pro-Palestinian appeals. In 2004, the group received an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa. A second international award, first given in 1985, was in 2007 to honor Oded Hermani, who was at the time a member of the International Society of Nuclear Medicine and with a PhD in theoretical physics, and was awarded the Dr. Harvester Medal of the Nuclear Medicine Association in recognition of his work in the field of molecular physics.  
 In April 2009, his daughter, Ze'ev Hermani-Dan, began working at the University of Tel Aviv as an instructor of the campus's theoretical physics department and a founding member of the PPS, now known as Tel Aviv Polytechnic Institute of Technology.

 = Howard Dyer =  
Howard Dyer ( 13 January 1899 – 6 July 1989 ) was an English-born Australian missionary, social worker and botanist. He was known for his advocacy of the liberation of women and children from slavery and sexual slavery.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Howard Dyer was born in Dudley, Greater Manchester on 13 January 1899 to Sarah Jane Dyer ( died 28 September 1986 ) and William Arthur David Dyer, a surgeon. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School. In 1928, he began working as an assistant to John Theosophical, a leader of the Americanos, the Methodist movement. In 1937, at the age of 22, he became the first man to complete the English Ministry of Liberia, but he was soon released by the British on the grounds that he had failed the Land Rehabilitation Act of 1938.As a missionary, Dyer worked on sex slave patrols in South Africa and Liberia. He also provided medical aid to Pieter Marie Lundby. In 1937, Dyer became co-author of A Sentence on the Emancipation of Slaves in Liberia ( Freedoms Press, 1948 ), which gained widespread acclaim and exposure, and was translated into 19 other languages. He served as Secretary for Uganda from 1939 to 1946. He first visited Liberia in 1935, when a British consular official arrived on the island to collect evidence of slave owners, but after this he spent almost five years working on the conversion of slaves in the country. He was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1945 and the Order of Malta in 1948.Dyer and William Smith acted as translators for the book's subsequent English edition. He was also the editor of a booklet in 1949 on Lusaka, a city in northern Uganda. It was based on a paper written by Mary McKeague Yeats.Dyer died in a searing car crash in 1989 in a medical facility in Sydney, Australia.  
   
   
 == Views on child marriage ==  
   
 Dyer wrote A Sentence on the Emancipation of Slaves in Liberia ( Freedoms Press, 1948 ). Dyer acknowledged that, because of the Great Depression, widespread child marriage was in fact common, but argued that among the population at large child marriage was unusual. He believed that the best way to end child marriage was through the government-funded Birth Control Funds.Dyer advocated the `` liberation of women from slavery and sexual slavery '', as well as `` free education and free health care for all '', using child marriage as a means to achieve these goals.He opposed the compulsory sterilization of children, and argued that the unethical practice was morally damaging. In 1948 Dyer was quoted as saying : `` … there was never any doubt that women were slaves to men, that they were tools whose use it was their own. 'Equal pay for equal work '... can never apply to women and children. I want to raise the old age of consent for the U.S. to eight. I want to raise the age of consent for the 50 states to at least sixteen. '' Dyer believed that child marriage violated human rights and `` is, by definition, unnatural and not to be tolerated.

 = Vilfredo Pareto =  
Vilfredo Pareto ( April 21, 1875 in Piacenza – February 15, 1960 ) was an Italian biologist. He is best known for his comparative studies of the process of evolution. His work in biology developed from his own collection of material, to the works of these men,. In particular, he showed that mutations in the algal species of lambda-antorals, permethrin, neutrophil, pectin and striata, which he had previously described in his own right,, were also responsible for their respective innovations in the algal kingdom. These substitutions resulted in the formation of new groups and phyla. An example of this was the heterotrophic genera Liolaemus and Liolaemorpha. Subsequent species of stellate alga were also called by Pareto : Sparta or Spatholite, Colegio, Canaria and Spati.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Pareto was born in Piacenza, Italy, the son of a member of the Piacenza Chamber of Commerce. He then studied at the Ecole de France and University of Padua, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1885. During the first years of his professional career he devoted much time to the publication of scientific articles in the field of his specialty, evolution, for which he became professor at Padua University in 1887. In addition to his scientific contributions to this specialty, Pareto served as an administrator at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rome, as well as being rector of that institution. He was also responsible for the prefect of the Pontifical Athenaeum, of which he served as president until his death.  
 His works in biology were wide-ranging : he published a vast series of works on the herpetology of Italy, and on the taxonomy of the bryozoans, in 1887–1890, and in 1897–1902 published a book on coral evolution. In addition to his work on evolution, Pareto made several contributions to the field of paleobiology and described a number of new genera and species of insect, such as the bryozoans Proseta and Sesi, and the stellate Hyphlaena. Pareto's contribution to the genus Helix was no less important than his study of the relative numbers and forms of the several species in that genus.  
 Pareto died in Piacenza, Italy.

 Gaede was born in Lehe , Bremerhaven , the son of Prussian Colonel Karl Gaede and Amalia , nee Renf . In 1897 he began studying medicine at the University of Freiburg , but he soon switched to the field of physics . In 1901 he wrote his doctoral thesis on the change of the specific heat of metals with temperature . Subsequent research on the Volta effect in a vacuum was unsuccessful , as the pump technology of the time could not create sufficient vacuum for the investigations . This prompted Gaede to deal more closely with vacuum technology . He invented the rotating mercury pump for high vacuum , which he presented to his scientific colleagues in 1905 at a congress in Merano . Also in Freiburg im Breisgau , Gaede wrote his habilitation thesis on The external friction of gases in 1909 .   
 In 1913 he received a professorship at the University of Freiburg . In the following six years , he invented the momentum transfer pump ( molecular pump ) and a mercury diffusion pump . In 1919 , Gaede joined the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology as a professor of experimental physics , where he worked in the following research areas :   
    
 Vacuum technology   
 Radio and communications technology   
 Process for obtaining pure hydrogen and mercury   
 Exploration of lightning protection equipment   
 Movement of liquids in a rotating hollow ringIn 1930 , Gaede was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina . In 1933/34 two employees denounced Gaede to the Gestapo , as having called the National Socialists `` childish '' . He then had to retire , although all allegations proved to be false . Despite this incident , the Werner von Siemens Ring for 1933 was given to him in 1934 . He also received various awards at international level in the following years .   
 A lifelong consultancy contract from 1906 with Leybold GmbH of Cologne made it possible for him to continue his research in his private laboratory in Karlsruhe and later in Munich . Among other things , he invented the gas ballast principle . Gaede was the owner of almost 40 patents in Germany , and many others abroad . A call to return to the university in Karlsruhe after the end of the war did not reach Gaede .

 Guilfoyle worked on the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis, which was an equally important problem of disease control. He was also interested in tuberculosis and was elected a member of the All-Party Commission on Tuberculosis. He was particularly interested in the differentiation of pathogenic myc organisms, which was essential for assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of tuberculosis.His best-known contribution was the theory of lysis, which defined the technique of quantifying the extent of cytological damage to the cytoskeleton and performed the distinction between dermal ( vesicular ) and epidermis mycoplasma ( nerve cells ). In his theory he used the criteria of rhodopsin and the reaction time of mycoplasmas to distinguish particular stages of elimination.  
 Guilfoyle showed that infection of mycoplasma was normal. The treatment of BAPHID ( pneumococcal eye infection ) with hydrogen peroxide is so effective in the treatment of the disease.

He was survived by his wife , the concert pianist Estelle Wine , and their three children . His father was a rabbi from Lithuania , while scientist Samuel Devons was his brother .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 As a child Devons ’ family moved throughout Britain and he was schooled at Hanley High School , Portsmouth Grammar School , and North Manchester Grammar School . From 1931 to 1934 , Devons attended the Victoria University of Manchester where he read Economics , Politics and Modern History and would graduate with first class honours . After graduating he received a research fellowship to undertake an MA specialising in Economics and produced a well-received thesis on productivity that was published in The Economic Journal.He worked as an economic assistant in Manchester at the Joint Committee of Cotton Trades Organisations over the period 1935–1939 and was brought into the Ministry of Supply , as a statistician working on Cotton Control , soon after the outbreak of the Second World War . Within a year he was encouraged to join the War Cabinet ’ s Central Economic Intelligence Service ( the precursor to the Economic Section and Central Statistics Office ) by John Jewkes and Harry Campion , two former colleagues from Manchester . Devons began work in Whitehall in March 1940 and joined a tight group of former academics and economists – a group that also included Lionel Robbins , Norman Chester , Alec Cairncross , Evan Durbin , D.G . Champernowne , and Harold Wilson – drafted into the British war effort . Between 1940 and 1945 he became the first Chief Statistician for the Central Statistics Office , then Director of Statistics , and finally the Director General of Planning , Programmes and Statistics with the Ministry of Aircraft Production.After the war , he returned to Manchester as a Reader in Applied Economics and , in 1947 , was appointed the Robert Ottley Professor of Applied Economics ( the first such chair in a British University ) . Despite initial reservations , he remained at Manchester until 1959 and helped to build a dynamic Faculty of Economic and Social Studies working alongside Arthur Lewis , Harry Johnson , Michael Polyani , Max Glukman and Bill Mackenzie . Devons ’ career ended at the London School of Economics ( where he had replaced James Meade as Professor of Commerce ) when illness forced his early retirement in 1965 ; the Ely Devons Prize , for outstanding performance in the MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics programme , is awarded in his honour . Away from Higher Education , he served on the council of the Royal Economic Society ( 1956–1964 ) , the Local Government Commission ( 1959 to 1965 ) and as a sometime Government advisor to the aircraft industry and Monopolies Commission .   
    
    
 == Influence ==   
 Despite being known for his obstinacy , Devons was well liked by his colleagues and well respected by his peers . Though often a critic , he was an able and constructive administrator who held a wide range of research interests . These were disseminated across a range of academic papers , newspaper articles and broadcast talks as well as in a notable survey of his wartime experience . This work has since been overlooked by economists and historians alike , but has recently been rediscovered as both as ‘ a useful source of practical operations management `` know how '' ’ and as an important source to use when considering the complex relationship between economics and politics in Britain during the 1940s and 1950s .

 = Jacob Altberg =  
Jacob Altberg ( November 9, 1884, New York – September 12, 1966, Basingstoke, England ) was a Swiss economist, politician, and public figure.  
 Altberg is best known for his contributions to U.S. politics, notably from 1910 to 1920 as a leader of a Republican policy alliance that was defeated by Herbert Hoover in the presidential election of 1920, but served as a catalyst for a rejection of the New Deal's economic liberalism.  
 Born into a Jewish family, he grew up in Europe. Having failed in undergraduate school and passed an entrance exam to Leipzig University, he studied law in Berlin. He became a lawyer before marrying, at the age of 26, Regina Zahn and emigrating to America.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1904 he was hired by New York Times reporter Tom Engelhardt to work for the central bank, serving on the New York State Committee on Agriculture. He started in the legal department at the City & County of New York. From 1909 to 1919 he was the private secretary of U.S. senator Benjamin Zinn and a clerk in the New York Supreme Court. On the eve of the American Civil War, he joined the Union Volunteer Reserve ( U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ). He was employed by the Department of Agriculture, later the Bureau of Redevelopment, during the Reconstruction Administration. In 1921 he became associate editor of The New York Herald-Tribune.  
 In 1923, he married Jane Irene Blaschke, later widow of the distinguished American carpenter and artist Frank Blaschke, with whom he had a daughter and three sons.  
 In 1927 he founded the Institute for Economic Studies at the University of Rochester.  
 In the 1930s, Altberg became a Republican by joining the Republican Policy Committee, serving until 1945. When Hoover was appointed to the presidency of the U.S. in 1930, the leading Republican intellectuals, including Samuel Gompers, began a campaign to dismiss Altberg. He was elected a Republican in 1946 and then did much of his own research for a piece in National Review.  
 In 1947, he was named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the highest distinction granted by the Academy. He served as a senior advisor to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1951 and chairman of the Council on Economic Policy from 1952 to 1953.  
 As such, he was the most important leader of the Republican coalition in the U.S. House of Representatives during his career. Altberg represented the New York City district from 1911 to 1920 until his retirement in 1966. He is credited with important steps in expanding the number of tax cuts in the U.S. in the early post-World War I years, by reducing the top marginal income-tax rate from 100 percent to 28 percent, and with establishing the U.S. bank credit to help companies around the world. He was also one of the major Republican leaders in combating the subject of Argentina's socialist government. He finally left politics in 1957 and died in Basingstoke, England.

Oswald Samuel Landry ( April 17, 1915 – July 31, 1988 ) was an American neuroanatomist. He worked at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and participated in the development of the first brain models, the Landry motor.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Landry graduated from Columbia University in 1941, then joined Harvard Medical School in 1943. He worked on animals as a neuroanatomist before being hired to the California Institute of Technology in 1953. He spent much of the next three decades at the Center for Brain and Behavior, a private facility in Glendale, California, specializing in experimental neuroanatomy. He died in 1988, one year after being appointed chairman of the department of neuroanatomy at the university.One of his earlier accomplishments was discovering and observing the birth defect Diabetes in humans. He also documented thousands of cases of adult blindness and brain damage to rats from Glioblastoma.  
   
   
 == Brain modeling ==  
 In 1971, Landry published the landmark Landry research in human activity. He and colleagues used brain lesions to show that people can rapidly and predictably move their brains into new locations. The first detailed images of the brain showed how different parts of the brain reacted when they were touched in specific locations.  
 The Landry model was described and named for a brain region, called the neocortex, that develops in response to the human body. Neuroscientists Robert Landry, Bruce R. Walter, and Donald J. Landry described Landry's Model in Human Behavior ( first published in 1987 ). The Landry model is a programmable computational model that promotes prediction of behaviors. The goal of the model is to capture every type of behavior by locating the position and amplitude of neuronal events that can induce the behavior in advance.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Landry is recognized for his pioneering work in the experimental neuroanatomy. With the assistance of Joseph L. Schwartz, he wrote and published on the function of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.He contributed to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease.

 = Ferdinand David (musician) =   
Ferdinand Ernst Victor Carl David ( German : [ ˈdaːvɪt ] ; 19 June 1810 – 18 July 1873 ) was a German virtuoso violinist and composer .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in the same house in Hamburg where Felix Mendelssohn had been born the previous year , David was raised Jewish but later converted to Protestant Christianity . David was a pupil of Louis Spohr and Moritz Hauptmann from 1823 to 1824 and in 1826 became a violinist at Königstädtischen Theater in Berlin . In 1829 he was the first violinist of Baron Carl Gotthard von Liphardt 's ( father of Karl Eduard von Liphart ) string quartet in Dorpat and he undertook concert tours in Riga , Saint Petersburg and Moscow . In 1835 he became concertmaster ( Konzertmeister ) at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig working with Mendelssohn . David returned to Dorpat to marry Liphart 's daughter Sophie . In 1843 David became the first professor of violin ( Violinlehrer ) at the newly founded Leipziger Konservatorium für Musik .   
 David worked closely with Mendelssohn , providing technical advice during the preparation of the latter 's Violin Concerto in E minor . He was also the soloist in the premiere of the work in 1845 , and , with Clara Schumann , played the official premiere of Schumann 's first violin sonata in Leipzig in March 1852 .   
 He died suddenly in 1873 , aged 63 , while on a mountain excursion with his children , near Klosters in the Graubünden ( Grisons ) area of Switzerland .   
    
    
 == Compositions ==   
 David 's own compositions number about 50 opuses . They include 12 `` theme and variations '' pieces for violin and Orchestra , five violin concertos , a string sextet , `` Concertinos '' for Violin , Bassoon , Clarinet & Trombone and Orchestra , and a number of Lieder . Supposedly he also wrote two symphonies and an opera ( Hans Wacht , 1852 ) . Unfortunately , these have not been verified to have been preserved .   
 David 's most played piece today is without a doubt his Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra ( Op.4 ) . This piece is very often used as the obligatory piece for trombonists auditioning for symphony orchestras around the world .   
    
    
 == Editions and arrangements ==   
 David had close connections with Breitkopf & Härtel and other publishers in Leipzig , and also worked as editor of violin works including those of Francesco Maria Veracini , Pietro Locatelli and Johann Gottlieb Goldberg . He was editor of the complete Beethoven piano trios for C.F . Peters Edition . He was also editor of the set of J.S . Bach 's Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin in 1843 .   
 He made an arrangement for violin and piano of Niccolò Paganini 's 24 Caprices for Solo Violin , which was the version used for the world premiere integral recording of the Caprices , by Ossy Renardy and Walter Robert in 1940 , the centenary of Paganini 's death ; this was seven years before Ruggiero Ricci made the first recording of the original solo violin version.The Chaconne in G minor attributed to Tomaso Antonio Vitali was published for the first time from a manuscript in the Sächsische Landesbibliothek in Dresden in David 's well renowned violin-method Die Hohe Schule des Violinspiels ( 1867 ) .   
 He also wrote an often used version of the cadenza for Beethoven 's violin-concerto , used by 12-year old Joseph Joachim at the revival-concert of this piece in 1844 , under Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy .   
    
    
 == Trivia ==   
 David played on a 1742 Guarneri violin , which later became the main performance violin for Jascha Heifetz . The David Guarneri violin is now in the collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco ; it is on permanent loan to Alexander Barantschik who has showcased it with the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Academy Orchestra.On the recommendation of William Sterndale Bennett , with whom he had worked in Leipzig , David 's son Paul David became the first Director of Music at Uppingham School from 1864–1908 .

 = Alexander Dubsky =  
Alexander Dubsky ( 18 April 1753 – 11 March 1832 ) was a Russian Russian statesman, mathematician, physicist, writer and scientist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Dubsky was born at Kolmenka. In his youth he studied mathematics and astronomy at Moscow University and at Saint Petersburg Military Academy, obtaining his doctorate at Saint Petersburg in 1774. He was not employed during the Revolution, but afterwards became a lecturer at Saint Petersburg Military Academy. In 1793 he became the first vice-rector of the Institute of the Propagation of Learning. In 1796 he became a member of the International Mathematical Society.  
 During the Revolution, Dubsky was among those who advocated free trade, but lost his seat at the Institute of the Propagation of Learning and was banned for three years from going to Paris and other European capitals. He then returned to Russia, where he became the chairman of the Russian Library in Paris. His work brought him recognition throughout Russia, and during the Russian Revolution he became its deputy to the Imperial Government, which is thought to have favored him and others with the patronage of the Prussian government.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 Dubsky is considered the father of mathematical physics. His main research interest was the relations between two potentials of infinite curvature, V and F, and their vector product with the same degree, M. It has been argued that he wrote the first mathematical treatise on linear equations, a work that is known as Leopold ( 1795 ), which has influenced many modern mathematicians. The solution to the Leopold equation has three solutions : M=2/M, F=1/2, and V=1/4. The author did not assume a uniform distribution of the variables but he allowed for their properties.  
 Dubsky introduced the idea of simultaneous dualities that can be expressed as elementary numbers, analogous to the Dirac integral. The book of Syllogism began this work. Later, Dubsky solved the elliptic curves from 5:2:3 and from 3:2 :2 :4 by starting from 4 and ending from 3. He was not a prolific inventor and did not publish many works.

 He was born in London, the son of Dr William Hooker, Royal College of Surgeons of the South East. His father was also the founder and senior director of the Royal Institution. He attended King's College, Oxford and graduated in 1823. There he worked on chemistry and physiology. He became a resident at King's College, graduating in 1826. While at King's College, Hooker discovered iodine to be useful as an antiseptic in both physical and psychological conditions. In 1827 he moved to the University of Cambridge to work on tuberculin fever. In that year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, a peerage he held for eight years, during which time he also published several important papers on acids and minerals.  
 In 1829, he succeeded John Thomson as librarian at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. A student of James Garnier, he held the post until his death on 16 March 1853.  
 He had lived in Amsterdam from 1775, and became a close friend and associate of Edward Jenner in 1832. He married Thomas Frederica Thomson ( 1797–1853 ), one of his students, on 23 September 1834. They had two children, Margaret and David.

 = Humphrey Spruce =  
Humphrey Spruce ( May 23, 1887 – March 1, 1958 ) was a British physician and geneticist who became the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg. He demonstrated that recombination between two chromosomes was possible, thus establishing a link between cross-sex chromosomes and normal biology.Spruce was born in Bournemouth, England, and educated at Birkbeck College, London. He obtained his PhD in 1909 from the University of Cambridge, where he lectured on plant physiology. He was awarded the Arnold Owen Prize in 1930, the Edgar B. Evans Prize in 1936, and the Arnold C. Spruce Medal in 1932. The Edward Avery Memorial Medal of the American Society of Plant Pathologists is named in his honor.  
 Spruce later worked in the institute of medical genetics at the British Medical Research Council. He was elected president of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1937. His papers on Japanese measles were published in American journals. He published over 120 scientific papers and received many honors, including the Robert F. Reed Foundation prize.  
 His research mainly focused on the genetics of viruses. He suggested that certain variants of the influenza virus were inherited from several women, but his research of venereal diseases did not establish this. Nevertheless, he was the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg, while others have since verified the basis of this finding.  
 Spruce described 11 different herpesviruses, and it is estimated that he identified 46 million different forms of these viruses. He is remembered as a scientific pioneer because he showed that two of the four `` biological girls '' of the Zaire epidemic of 1918, Sars or West Nile ( two subspecies of the Sars ) were genetically distinct ; however, it was only by isolating the E4 segment of that virus that he was able to establish the exact sequence of its RNA content.

Walter Greiling ( 5 September 1900 – 1986 , Neu-Isenburg ) was a German chemist and futurologist . He sometimes used the pseudonym Walt Grey .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Greiling studied social and natural sciences in Frankfurt and Marburg ( Dr. phil . 1921 ) . He partially earned his living as a worker in coal and sulfide mining .   
 Greiling did research in the field of agricultural microbiology . He worked at the Technische Hochschule in Hannover , as an assistant , as well as for the Hamburgisches Welt-Wirtschafts-Archiv ( Hamburg archive of world economy ) . He participated in designing the Brussels Atomium for Expo 58 , was an editor of the social and economic magazine Wirtschaftsdienst , editor-in-chief of Chemische Industrie ( chemical industry ) , and a collaborator of the London and Cambridge Economic Service . He led the information service of the main association of the chemical industry of Germany and wrote several books on developments in sciences and technique .   
    
    
 == Greiling 's predictions till 2100 ==   
 Greiling , in his work Wie werden wir leben ? Ein Buch von den Aufgaben unserer Zeit ( How are we going to live ? A book of the tasks of our time ; 1954 ) , foresaw the rest of the 20th century as a time in which there would , for the present , further be overexploited natural resources . He foretold that from 1990 to 1995 , there would begin systematic international efforts to mitigate climate change and that , shortly after the turn of the millennium , there would for the first time come about a sudden and crisis-laden shortage of the international supply of petroleum . World population would balance out at about nine billion , rather earlier than later in the 21st century . During the 21st century , mankind would succeed to cooperate internationally in shifting to biological raw materials . This and big undertakings to humidify the Sahara , Turkestan and further regions of the Earth would make it possible to feed ten billion people with comparative ease . Greiling warns of attempts to use nuclear energy . He starts the question how one would handle the newly gained wealth , once the pressing difficulties would be overcome so that people would be urged to pause for inspiration .

The cartoons included geisha and hokum from various parts of Japan and the Amazonian coast as well as pantaloons from classic engravings. A large number of Japanese and Asian animal and human figures were drawn, and an image of a peacock in a raincoat attracted the attention of some Japanese women who commented that it matched the style and tone of Tsunami. The series was popular and became so popular that Yoder was required to obtain permission from the Japanese Ministry of Education to include it on their leaflets.Yoder also produced pictures for many German magazines and organisations, including Bibliotheque Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Belgian-Canadian firm of Bader and Emile ( a hunting lodge company ), and served as President of the International Society of Japanese Paintings. A collection of Yoder's paintings was held by the American Fund for the Arts in Milwaukee.

It was at Christ Church that her love for archaeology and archaeology education was brought to a head.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 As a student, McFarland had two readings of Augustus Caesar, both Roman histories and both translated into English. She became enthusiastic about the subject and could not stop reading the classics and was astonished to find that Roman classics were more akin to contemporary American history than to classical Greek. However, the interest she showed for archaeology remained in the back of her mind for a very long time.McFarland began excavating and the rest of her life her interest and talents were focused on the Roman ruins and monumental monuments in northern Britain and on a systematic study of the Roman language, Roman society, writing, and architecture. This allowed her to see the significance of the ruins and made her the first archaeologist in Britain to do extensive excavation at Old Cardiff, a place that she believed had important political and religious significance.

In the absence of any reliable record, Brúníkr Dolíks is supposed to have been a businessman in some sort, or to have settled in Nord-Peléš near St. Moritz.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Brúníkr Dolíks was born in Kazan. He graduated in law in 1901 and was a lawyer until 1931.  
 In 1930, Brúníkr Dolíks participated in the 1947 Lavra crisis. He was investigated by an investigation team led by Prof. Jiráš Kotzebue as the perpetrator. He was arrested under a European arrest warrant, since Prague was not part of the Annex to the UN Convention against Torture ( 1977 ) and the author of the statement was not at home on the night of the arrest. Brúníkr Dolíks was tried by the Soviet Special Tribunal of Soviet Judicature and sentenced to 12 years in a Special Security Clinic. The case was sent to the International Court of Justice in The Hague on June 29, 1980, where the appeals were abandoned. This decision came after a six-year legal battle. On June 27, 1995, the presiding Judge, Ann Arbor Owen, issued an order and the case was tried again, but it was rescheduled for December 14, 1997.  
 In March 2003, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Czechoslovakia officially stated that the arrest warrant and conviction were either valid or not valid. According to a country spokesman, now 25 years, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Czech Republic `` has no direct proof '' that Brúníkr Dolíks committed any crimes during the Lavra crisis, `` but we are pleased that he finally faced justice ''. It is still possible that the case is still open.In December 2009, the International Supreme Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the most severe punishment was not sufficiently justified, with the exact details stating that he had failed to disclose enough information to the investigator to classify as a traitor. Since Brúníkr Dolibor's death, several further prosecution and trial cases are still pending.

 = Alexander Kraig =  
Alexander Kraig ( Russian : Алекса́ндр Мари́й Ива́н ; August 7, 1906 – July 28, 1998 ) was a Soviet metallurgist and cosmologist born in Saint Petersburg. He invented the so-called K-matrix or fast magnetron for the Tevatron, which later became the neutron spectrometer of the USSR. He has also been known for the invention of the K-nuclei, a group of nuclei in the proton with its helical three-dimensional structure.Kraig was a professor at the Physical Physics Department of Moscow State University, his nephew, which became the Institute for Near-Infrared Studies, where he worked under Valentin Chernofeev.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Kraig was the son of Alexander and Ella ( mother Gizinevna ) Kraig and first got his education in the 1920s in Nizhny Novgorod. Afterwards, he completed several teaching positions in Nizhny Novgorod and Saint Petersburg State University. After finishing his educational course at the Nizhny Novgorod State University, in 1927 Kraig began to take advanced classes at the University of Moscow ( two Ph.D. and one doc. diss. students ). In 1929 he began teaching physics at the Moscow State University, under Stalin. In 1939 he was promoted to full professor, becoming the director of the department of applied physics. In 1947 he became the chairman of the Mathematics Department of the Moscow State University.  
 In the early 1950s Kraig also began to research in axial torsion, applied matrices, elastic scattering and even the lattice field theory of crystals. His research led to the development of the ultrashort-width laser matrix and also enhanced the production of thin films by means of an extended nuclear crystal ( a so-called vortex blockade ). The model formed in 1952 is the blueprint used for the K-nuclei used in many today's modern spectroscopes and the so-called energy hysteresis rhopalo.Kraig was a member of the Institute of Near-Infrared Studies ( IRIOS ) of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labor in 1955. He received the Physicist Medal in 1958 and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1960.  
 In the 1960s and 1970s, Kraig did research at the Institute for Near-Infrared Studies in the Leningrad meteorological facility. From 1984 to 1987, Kraig was the head of the Department of Applied Physics of Moscow State University, which produced the renowned K-nuclei and became the leading institute in the country in physics and metallurgy.Kraig joined the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1963 as a scientific officer and in 1973 was named a member of the Peasant's Party of the USSR. On the recommendation of Yuri Andreev, he was elected to the Soviet Academy of Sciences in the 1980s.Kraig was one of the first to apply superconductivity to thermal treatment of matter. He was a founder and the head of the research group for superconductivity and an early contributor to the development of the WPC ( wire thin-film method ).  
 He died on July 28, 1998, in Saint Petersburg from heart failure at the age of 57.

He studied at the Royal College of Science in London and was a Professor of Chemistry at Corpus Christi College, Oxford ( 1861–1907 ). He became an eminent Anglican priest. In the post of Curate of Eccles Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, he became well known as a botanist. He authored several popular books on botany.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Arthur Turrell was born in Wentworth, Manchester on 28 October 1859. The family moved to Milton Keynes in 1865, and he and his brother Andrew spent most of the remainder of their lives there. As a young man he was a keen amateur photographer, and he bought, and painted, a series of portraits of himself as a young boy, which became famous, and became a best-seller. In 1887, Turrell edited and published an edition of a 12th-century botanical work on Polderrads by Richard Bradley, sometimes called The Bradley Catalogue of Plants, from Cambria to Gibraltar.He was the son of physician Samuel Turrell, and father of the Anglican clergyman and botanist Arthur Turrell. Turrell was the grandfather of the English atheist David Turrell.  
 He lived in Reading from his middle age to his death.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Arthur Turrell was a strict Calvinist with views on abortion and abortion practices, but his views changed to support church dogma in all areas of life. Turrell was a specialist in this branch of Christianity, and he was by far the most extensive of the theologians advocating their policy. He believed that the Bible contains all the laws of nature, and that the church was able to conclusively uphold those laws with absolute certitude. Therefore, he supported the party which tended to establish the strongest doctrines in the modern sense ( Puritanism ).  
 As such, he said that scripture contains no opinion on women, only on men, and all men are created equal. He stressed the scientific aspects of Scripture in his writings, insisting on the general validity of the Bible, even of the canonical ones, with the exception of Abraham and Isaac. He felt that Christianity needed to accept many revisions, which are usually necessary to update doctrine as new evidence comes to light. He strongly objected to marriage, especially for unmarried men. He was very disappointed with secular culture of the time, and believed that it was largely the world around him and the world around him in general that failed him, instead of his own views.

In 1882 he founded the Centre for Experimental Investigation of the Brain at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. He then led experiments to determine whether pigment and other proteins can cause tissues to degenerate by affecting their specific states.  
 He was the first to show the contribution of proteins to the theory of glycogen-peroxidation in contrast to calcium-dependent oxygen metabolism and the storage of energy in the liver, where in contrast to cyanogen it is located.

He was later a senior lecturer at the Karolinska Institutet and in 1900–1903 head of its Department of Pathology. From 1899 until 1905 he held the chair of Zoology at the University of Stockholm. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1918. He died in 1934 in Stockholm.  
 Fischler developed several new diseases, in particular cerebral amyloidosis. His research on insulin resistance led him to hypothesize that vitamin B12 is a problem. In 1910 he demonstrated that the splenocyte mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for insulin-resistant skeletal muscle, which is an early discovery that also contributed to subsequent advances in kidney function.

 = Clifford Charles Butler =   
Sir Clifford Charles Butler FRS ( 20 May 1922 – 30 June 1999 ) was an English physicist , best known for the discovery of the hyperon and meson types of particles . In later life , Butler was involved in educational policy , serving as director of the Nuffield Foundation and vice-chancellor of Loughborough University .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Butler was born in Reading on 20 May 1922 , the son of Charles Hannington James Butler , a clerk and buyer to a local wholesale grocer , and his wife Olive Pembroke . He attended both Reading School and the University of Reading , becoming both a Bachelor of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy there . He was appointed assistant lecturer in physics at the University of Manchester in 1945 , and lecturer in 1947 . In the same year he married Kathleen Betty Collins . They had two daughters . He died in Leicester on 30 June 1999 .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 At Manchester , Butler worked with G. D. Rochester , studying cosmic rays using a cloud chamber . During this research , they found two unexpected events , one in October 1946 and one in May 1947 , showing previously unknown particles . These V particles were a thousand times heavier than the electron and long-lived on nuclear timescales . In order to increase the rate of detection with a higher flux of cosmic rays , the equipment was moved to the Pic du Midi de Bigorre observatory in the Pyrenees . The existence of the particles was confirmed by a group from the California Institute of Technology led by Carl Anderson , and the Butler group continued to study them and found that there were two types , hyperons and mesons . Butler 's and Rochester 's discovery may be seen as the first step towards understanding of the quark structure of matter.In 1953 , Butler left Manchester to lead a high-energy nuclear physics group at Imperial College in London . He was promoted to professor in 1957 , and head of the physics department in 1963 . While at Imperial College London , Butler chaired the consortium established to design the British National Hydrogen Bubble Chamber , which was operated at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and CERN . From 1964 , he chaired the CERN Track Chamber Committee.. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1961 , and served as dean of the Royal College of Science between 1966 and 1969 . Over this period he became increasingly interested in educational policy , joining the academic planning board of the University of Kent in 1963 , the Schools Council in 1965 , and the University Grants Committee in 1966 . He eventually served on the Schools Council for 19 years.In 1970 , Butler resigned from Imperial College and his active involvement in physical research ceased . He accepted the role of director of the Nuffield Foundation , a charitable foundation influential in education . During his time there he set up a group for research and innovation in higher education , a programme for law and society , and the centre for agricultural strategy at the University of Reading . His role in the establishment of the Open University was also important , since the Nuffield Foundation funded a course on genetics as a test bed for other courses . He was appointed to the council of the Open University in 1971 and stayed as a member until 1995 , serving as vice-chairman from 1986 to 1995 . In 1975 , Butler was appointed vice-chancellor of Loughborough University , retaining that post until he retired in 1985 .

 = Thomas Franklin (naturalist) =  
Thomas Franklin ( 14 September 1818 – 28 November 1888 ) was an English chemist and mycologist.  
 Franklin was educated at nearby Shoreham School. His father James Franklin ( 1765–1835 ) was Superintendent of St. Thomas'School for Boys and Director of the British Museum. Thomas also grew up and attended Shoreham School. At age 15 he was made an apprentice by John Griffiths, professor of chemistry at Teddington College and the chemist at sea.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Thomas was born on 14 September 1818, son of Timothy and Mary Ann Franklin. He attended Shoreham School, later being known as Isleworth. He took a keen interest in chemistry and was elected as an alternate at the local polytechnic, which in turn encouraged his interests.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1836, after studying for a year at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, he accepted a job as part of a prominent family business, that of consulting firm `` Edward Burton '', run by his father, which was later amalgamated to create the Fisher & Warner Company. The firm made improvements to local service throughout the East Riding of Yorkshire, which then came under federal government. William Morgan Fisher, another employee of Edward Burton, became the company's general manager in 1851 and created the Fisher & Warner estate to house his firm's operations in the local area. At the time, Edward's wealth and influence secured him wide access to government.  
   
   
 == Teaching career ==  
 In 1847, Franklin began teaching chemistry at Bury St Edmunds and graduated in 1850. He was promoted to head chemistry teacher at the School, initially to Balliol College but later to St Thomas'School, in Hackney, which had become an early model for the University of Cambridge. He was also appointed head of his old school, North Staffordshire School of Pharmacy, which he continued to teach until his retirement in 1880. Franklin kept a keen interest in science from an early age and encouraged the use of apparatus that improved the efficiency and safety of both chemical and mechanical research. He wrote many reports on various subjects, including chemistry and a chemical microscope.Beginning in 1863, Franklin had his new school open to the public and encouraged new pupils and visitors to join the school for social purposes. In 1868, students and staff were building the first building to house the main laboratory of the Geological Survey, in Hyde Park, which is now the Edward Franklin Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. That year, he married Mary Steyn, a schoolmistress. Their children included :  
 Mary Grainger Franklin ( 1864–1887 ) and Douglas Franklin ( 1866–1929 ).Douglas was a friend of Professor William Watson in the University of Bristol, and the two had a successful partnership when Franklin left in 1882. They had two children, Alice and Robert :  
   
   
 == Medical career ==  
 The publication of Dr. Agar's Conjugate of nitrate, which he first published in 1874, improved the technique of mycological and microbiological research and provided a new route for mycologists to investigate the nature of mycological species and how they differed from one another. The discovery of cyanomyces yeast ( Agar's coal ) provided support for a broad-spectrum treatment of carbapenems and other fungi, which was illustrated by the discovery of cryptogamic fungi, such as Rhododendron cryptogamicum and Vesicularia junius.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Dr. Franklin wrote and published more than 250 papers and reviews, including investigations into the bacterial lipases, microflora and cytology of coal mines, the occurrence of Cyanomyces fungal spores in oil wells, and several types of fungi. He was a primary author of several leading monographs, as well as numerous co-authored journal articles, and he contributed to the United States National Library of Medicine and the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His report on the hard science of yeast cells is widely considered a classic in this field. His earlier papers on fungus discovered by the miner Alfred Rose under the United States system of mineral deposits were for more than half a century the definitive source for the broad scientific discussion of the fungi that inhabit underground rock basins.The mineral and botanical names of crystals found in several valleys in British India include :

David Eagleman ( February 7, 1943 – August 24, 2007 ) was an American physicist, mathematics and computer scientist and the Director of the Interdisciplinary Cyber Lab at the Harvard University.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 David Eagleman was born in Manhattan, New York. He attended Howard University, then enrolled in graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After completing his undergraduate degree he moved to the US to work as a computer scientist for a defense contractor. While at MIT, he and his then-girlfriend Dacher Keltner developed a personal computer using the Tianar–Jehovah keyboard, and at MIT the world's first simulated cell. David was interested in machine learning, and for this he was awarded the M.Sc. degree. During the early years of his PhD, while his wife was writing the thesis, he had several interactions with R. Ron Cutler, a researcher at the U.S. Navy's Defense Research and Development Agency. Cutler allowed David to develop Riemannian models for many statistical and physical problems. They soon collaborated on the analysis of key decision problems. His work on the dissertation with Cutler led to his permanent employment at Harvard in 1972. Eagleman also served as a Research Associate at the Department of Defense's Technical Research Program.  
 In the late 1980s he founded Eagleman, a new branch of mathematics and computational physics. His main work, the Dynamic Dynamical Control Section, produced the first fully verifiable experimental code for a computer. The entire work was a collaboration between Eagleman and Othmar Schall of the Telecommunications Research Center, in North Park, Illinois. The result is the Eagleman Test Suite, now fully operational.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After founding his department at Harvard in 1988, he spent the next 16 years in an increasing role, both within the department as well as as in the international community. He was president of the Association for Computational Mathematics and, from 2001 to 2005, was President of the Asper Institute. He also served as the chairman of the National Academy of Sciences'Joint Computer Science Symposiums from 2005 to 2008. He was awarded the R. Robertson Fund's Paul M. Hunter Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to the development of distributed computing systems in 2009.

 = Julius Abhand =  
Julius Abhand ( ; January 12, 1858 in Dresden – February 14, 1948 in Liège ) was a German pioneer of optical design of telescopes, having built a substantial number of spectroscopic instruments. He has been described as the `` father of optics ''.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Abhand studied geology and optics at the University of Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1861. From 1865 to 1866 he was professor of physics at Leipzig. In 1872 he became professor of optics in the physics department at the University of Liège, a position which he held until his death. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy in 1878.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 As a teacher and advocate of optics, Abhand developed many experiments. A good deal of his work is in the journal Optik. At Leipzig, he edited a leading textbook on optics, `` Die Ordnung der Optik '' ( 1865–1882 ). Abhand's laboratory at Liège was home to many of his most important students, including Claude-Alexis Moritat, Oscar Ruggiero, Otto Wiglesworth, Hennig Weinstock, Harald Blasdorf, Rudolf Mohr, Christian Jacobu, André Gantt, Wilhelm Herminhoff, and Frederic von Blücher.  
 Abhand published numerous papers and papers about optics. His chief contribution to optical research was his classification and description of the spectral lines which in general form the optics axis of a telescope. These lines are now termed the abtheil lines.  
 Abhand is commemorated in the name Abhand's triangle, which is named after him.

Friedrich Leopold Goltz ( 14 August 1834 in Posen ( Poznań ) , Grand Duchy of Posen – 5 May 1902 in Straßburg ( Strasbourg ) ) was a German physiologist and nephew of the writer Bogumil Goltz .   
 He studied medicine at the University of Königsberg , and following two years of surgical training , served as a prosector of anatomy in Königsberg . In 1870 he succeeded A.W . Volkmann as professor of physiology at the University of Halle , followed by a professorship at the University of Straßburg ( from 1872 ) . He is known for his experiments in neurophysiology , and is credited as being the first scientist to perform a hemispherectomy on a dog .   
 In 1870 he introduced the `` hydrostatic concept '' involving the semicircular canals of the inner ear and their ability to transmit sensations of position , and therefore providing assistance in equilibrioception . Goltz proposed that the canals dealt mainly with the equilibrium of the head , and that the movements of the body were regulated by the more or less conscious awareness an individual has of the position of his head in space.Goltz held a unitary view of brain function , which he demonstrated in London at the International Medical Congress of 1881 . Here he showed that a dog with sections of its cerebral cortex removed , could still remain functional . Conversely , Scottish neurologist David Ferrier held the belief of localization of cerebral functions , which he demonstrated at the same conference . Ferrier presented macaque monkeys with particular paralysis following specific surgeries of the motor cortex . Ferrier 's demonstration of localized functionality impressed the medical community , and was seen as a major impetus in the development of neurological surgery .   
    
    
 == Published works ==   
 He published several articles on the function of the heart and on the venous tone in Virchows Archiv of Pathological Anatomy as well as in Pflügers Archiv of Physiology . Among his principal writings are the following :

Thomas Attwood ( 6 October 1783 – 6 March 1856 ) was a British banker , economist , political campaigner and Member of Parliament . He was the leading figure of the underconsumptionist Birmingham School of economists , and , as the founder of the Birmingham Political Union , the leading figure in the public campaign for the Great Reform Act of 1832 .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Thomas Attwood was born in Halesowen , then a detached part of Shropshire , and attended Halesowen Grammar School ( now Earls High School ) before being moved to Wolverhampton Grammar School . On 12 May 1806 , Attwood married Elizabeth Carless from Lower Ravenhurst Farm , an area which is now part of the Moor Pool estate . They had two sons , George de Bosco Attwood ( 15 March 1808 ) and Thomas Aurelius Attwood ( 4 March 1810 ) . Their daughter Angela married Daniel Wakefield with whom she emigrated to New Zealand.He founded the Birmingham Political Union in 1830 . This was a political organization campaigning for cities , and large towns such as Birmingham , to be directly represented in Parliament . The Birmingham Political Union was foremost among groups lobbying the government for the passage of a Reform Bill to achieve this aim . The Days of May in 1832 brought the people 's struggle for wider enfranchisement to a head , and the Great Reform Act was passed on 15 May 1832 . After this success he became one of the first two Members of Parliament ( MPs ) for Birmingham ( along with Joshua Scholefield ) on 12 December 1832 , a position he held until 1839 .   
 Attwood lived at The Grove , a Georgian house in Harborne , Birmingham , between 1823 and 1846 . He died in Malvern , Worcestershire in 1856 .

 = Jurij Japelj =   
Jurij Japelj , also known in German as Georg Japel , ( 11 April 1744 – 11 October 1807 ) was a Slovene Jesuit priest , translator , and philologist . He was part of the Zois circle , a group of Carniolan scholars and intellectuals that were instrumental in the spread of Enlightenment ideas in the Slovene Lands . His translations of the Bible , based on the 16th-century translation of the Lutheran author Jurij Dalmatin , set the basis for the development of modern standard Slovene .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Born in the Upper Carniolan town of Kamnik , then part of the Habsburg Monarchy ( now in Slovenia ) , he studied in Jesuit schools in Ljubljana , Gorizia , and Graz . He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1769 in Trieste , where he served until the Suppression of the Jesuits in 1773 . He then became the personal secretary of Bishop of Ljubljana Karl Herberstein . Under Herberstein 's influence , Japelj became sympathetic to Jansenist ideas .   
 With the support of Bishop Herberstein , Japelj started translating religious texts into Slovene . He rejected the innovations of the Franciscan friar Marko Pohlin , and returned to the language of 16th-century Slovene Protestants , especially Jurij Dalmatin and Adam Bohorič . Together with Blaž Kumerdej , he began a new translation of the Bible in Slovene , based on Jurij Dalmatin 's translation from the 1580s .   
 In 1807 , he started compiling a grammar of Slovene , which , however , remained unfinished . He also translated several poems by Metastasio , Kleist , Racine , Hagedorn , and Pope into Slovene . He also wrote some original poems in a mixture of Classicism , Roccoco , and Sentimentalism .   
 In 1799 , Japelj became the director of the seminary in Klagenfurt , where he also covered other positions in the ecclesiastical and civil administration . He died in Klagenfurt in 1807 , shortly after being appointed bishop of Trieste .

Lucas lived at John and King's Wharf, London.Currie was educated at Oxford, under Benjamin Johnson and Thomas Loudon, studying with David Perkins and Alexander Pinsent.His mathematics degree, which he won at the age of fifteen, he obtained by study of geometry and algebraic equation theory. He enrolled in the Royal College of Science, and was second only to his master Charles Martinin in his ordination.While at Cambridge, he had become friends with his master James Davy, an amateur geologist, and also with the English naturalist Thomas Brookes. A year after leaving Cambridge, Davy made him a fellow of the Royal Society.  
 After returning from India to London in 1677, Currie entered the University of Oxford, where he studied under David Hume, Thomas Hooke, and Edward Baudelaire. In 1689, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.  
 In 1691, Currie succeeded James Davy as lecturer of mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of Oxford ; a year later he also held this post at Oxford College. He was a firm friend of the experimentalist Richard Tait, who was one of his students at Oxford.  
 On 17 September 1701, Currie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. On 24 April 1702, he became the 3rd Earl of Torquay ( from 1702 to 1732 ).Currie's collections are in the Library of King's College London, where his circle included his old tutor Thomas Beddoes, his professor in mathematics ( Baudelaire was also a student of Currie ), his son, the mathematician Sir Isaac Newton, and the engineer and writer Henry Wotton, and the artist John Standish. He is buried in the east choir churchyard in Holloway, and is buried next to his companion David Ripon in Loxley Cemetery.

 = Frederick Valentine Melsheimer =   
The Reverend Frederick Valentine Melsheimer ( September 25 , 1749 , Negenborn , Brunswick – June 30 , 1814 , Hanover , Pennsylvania ) was a Lutheran clergyman and early American entomologist , called the `` Father of American Entomology '' by successor Thomas Say . He was the author of the first major entomological work in the United States : A Catalogue of Insects of Pennsylvania ( 1806 ) , a sixty-page work that describes 1,363 species of beetles .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Melsheimer studied at the university in Helmstedt from 1772 to 1776 before becoming chaplain to the Duke of Brunswick 's Dragoons Regiment . With this regiment he arrived in Canada in 1776 to fight alongside British troops in the American Revolutionary War . He was taken prisoner by the American army on August 16 , 1777 following their victory at the Battle of Bennington and remained in prison for fourteen months . After being released on parole , he resigned from his office of chaplain and began to preach in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania .   
 In May 1779 , he accepted a call as pastor of five Lutheran congregations in Dauphin County . He married Maria Agnes Man on June 3 , 1779 . In 1784 , he moved to Manheim , where he was ordained to the ministry by the Lutheran ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1785 , and was pastor at New Holland from 1786 until 1789 . He was pastor at Hanover from 1790 until 1814 . His service exerted a strong influence on the German colonists of Pennsylvania , and his entomological interests were said to `` furnish some of his parishioners with mild amusement '' .   
 His insect collection , inherited and increased by his second son Frederick Ernst Melsheimer and his son 's friend Daniel Ziegler , was eventually purchased by Harvard University and formed the basis for what is now the largest university-owned collection of insects in the United States . His Catalogue was intended to be a three volume work , but illness prevented publication of more than the first volume , in 1806 .   
 Melsheimer was also interested in mineralogy and astronomy , and served as Professor of Languages at the recently founded Franklin College in 1787 . He died in 1814 of lung disease . Two of his eleven children also devoted themselves to natural history : John Frederick Melsheimer ( 1780-1829 ) and Frederick Ernst Melsheimer ( 1782-1873 ) .

 = Emma Lehmer =   
Emma Markovna Lehmer ( née Trotskaia ) ( November 6 , 1906 – May 7 , 2007 ) was a mathematician known for her work on reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory . She preferred to deal with complex number fields and integers , rather than the more abstract aspects of the theory .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 She was born in Samara , Russian Empire , but her father 's job as a representative with a Russian sugar company moved the family to Harbin , China in 1910 . Emma was tutored at home until the age of 14 , when a school was opened locally . She managed to make her way to the USA for her higher education .   
 At UC Berkeley , she started out in engineering in 1924 , but found her niche in mathematics . One of her professors was Derrick N. Lehmer , the number theorist well known for his work on prime number tables and factorizations . While working for him at Berkeley finding pseudosquares , she met his son , her future husband Derrick H. Lehmer . Upon her graduation summa cum laude with a B.A . in Mathematics ( 1928 ) , Emma married the younger Lehmer . They moved to Brown University , where Emma received her M.Sc. , and Derrick his Ph.D. , both in 1930 . Emma did not obtain a Ph.D. herself . Most universities had nepotism rules which prevented husband and wife from both holding teaching positions , although Emma claimed there were many advantages to not holding a Ph.D .   
 The Lehmers had two children , Laura ( 1932 ) and Donald ( 1934 ) .   
    
    
 == Contributions ==   
 Lehmer did independent mathematical work , including a translation from Russian to English of Pontryagin 's book Topological Groups . She worked closely with her husband on many projects ; 21 of her 56 publications were joint work with him . Her publications were mainly in number theory and computation , with emphasis on reciprocity laws , special primes , and congruences .   
 Paul Halmos , in his book I want to be a mathematician : An automathography , wrote about Lehmer 's translation of Pontryagin 's Topological Groups : `` I read the English translation by Mrs. Lehmer ( usually referred to as Emma Lemma ) ... '' . Several later publications repeated Halmos ' reference to reinforce the significance of Lehmer 's translation .

 = George Herman Bellinghausen =  
George Herman Bellinghausen ( 7 April 1861 – 9 February 1935 ) was a Dutch chemist and malacologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bellinghausen was born in Amsterdam. After a thorough study of science, he completed his medical degree from the Free University of Brussels, and began his career as an experimental pathologist, developing an interest in the effects of alcohols and pesticides. He conducted research at the University of Liège under the supervision of Hermann von Helmholtz. Bellinghausen received the British Royal Medal in 1879 and the Royal Medal of the Netherlands in 1884.  
 His most notable discovery was the first demonstration of chemical mobility, also known as liquid-non-metallic microspheres, as well as a field-effect microsphere, which was a device which demonstrated high strength and speed at very low temperatures.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Bellinghausen obtained his habilitation in chemistry from the University of Liège in 1888 and spent most of his later life at Liège, where he conducted clinical work and was appointed a professor of chemistry and physics at the Faculty of Medicine in 1899. At Liège he led the Swedish textile institute in their first years of existence, and in 1912 succeeded Carl Stiegler as director of the institute and dean of the chemistry department. Bellinghausen worked on the stationary gel theory, developed in the 1880s, which was the basis for the mineral hypothesis of J. J. Thomson. He also developed an instrument for measuring the half-life of solvent ( later used for the record keeping of chemical reactions ). In 1889 Bellinghausen published the `` tetrahedral disulfide ring '' ( TEDS ), a discovery which put him at the forefront of the ether theory. The tetrahedral disulfide ring was the first such theoretical unit to be provided with stereophase, the polymerization process involved in the manufacturing of silicon dioxide, a compound widely used in today's electronics, and was particularly important in the dye process. He also discovered the euthenic liquid state of amino acids ( 1894 ).  
 In 1893 Bellinghausen co-founded the Allgemeine Physikae des Chemie-Neueren Vereins ( APNV ), a research group which investigated the role of formaldehyde as an absorbent and dispersant for microspheres. He spent the rest of his career at the AMNH, where he oversaw the development of many outstanding chemical instruments such as the microspheres and electromagnetic oscillators, creating one of the best laboratories in the world.  
 Bellinghausen died in Liège, aged 65, on 9 February 1935. He is buried at the Abbeville cemetery.  
   
   
 == Awards and honours ==  
 Bellinghausen was a recipient of the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1918 and the George Weyl Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1931.

Ludwig Theodor Bach ( April 29, 1798 – January 8, 1871 ) was a German pianist, pedagogue and composer. He was a professor and a canon of the Catholic Theological Academy in Breslau, and a member of the Congregation of the Holy Office.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Bach was born in Braunschweig, one of four children of Siegfried Bach, who was the commander of the Hessian Army and Kaiser Wilhelm I's physician in northern Germany. One of his brothers, Franz, was also a composer and educator. He graduated from the local grammar school in 1784. As a schoolteacher in the local town of Eppendorf-Dienst, Bach was deeply influenced by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He is said to have taught Goethe's son Ludwig so that he could become a composer, though details remain unclear. During his time in Eppendorf-Dienst he was known as `` Nr. Bach, or the Father of German Music '', an homage to Goethe's influence on the composer and musician. As a composer Bach primarily wrote piano pieces for piano, for string quartets and chamber music, and German Romantic music. In addition, Bach also wrote and composed for chamber music, and lieder. He published several works of theoretical piano pedagogy, including Wald- und zum Zusammenhöhe, römische Untersuchungen aus ihren einige Amtzehnten in ihrem letzten Zusammenhang.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1796 he became a schoolteacher in the village of Breslau ( then part of Upper Palatinate, now Breslau, Bavaria ), where he continued to practice piano until his death in 1871. While in Eppendorf-Dienst he was encouraged by local Jesuits and deans. In 1803, after successfully completing the `` Die Mannesbürgerdienst '' ( course of piano study ), he was appointed professor of pedagogy in the academy, a position he held until 1804.He also directed a school in Erfurt, and taught piano and musical composition there, and in Breslau and Mönchenbüttel. Bach was a member of the Bavarian Cultural Association and one of the founders of the Stellliche Musikverein, and co-founded the Encyklopädie für Musik von Lower Palatinate. From 1805 he lectured at the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Freiburg and Freiburg-am-Main.In 1823 Bach authored his most popular, and longest-lasting, book, Der Leben Blut- und Bücher. It first appeared in 1824 under the title Das Originalisten und Testimonyen, and was, in 1824, translated into German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Polish. The book itself contained many impassioned essays on both music theory and the expressive works of music, although he also avoided several difficult ideas such as melodic dichotomy and tonal pitch. The book was well received by its composer, Richard Wagner, who later invited Bach to write music for him for use in his operas. Bach also wrote some simple chamber works for piano. In 1835 he was appointed chaplain at the Benedictine monastery of Cracow, after having served there for only a year.Bach's Beiträge zur Altertumsphilosophie ( 1825 ) is considered to be a classic in the German musical literature. Bach studied with Heinrich Schelling, and explored new musical approaches. His travels in the years 1827–28 and 1830–32 at Franz Liszt's court, Venice and the Pontifical Athenaeum during the latter's lifetime, encouraged him to create his own more progressive compositional ideas. Bach was also influenced by Franz Schubert, whose music he was familiar with, such as the Piano Sonata in C major.

 = Edwin P. Cleet =  
Edwin P. Cleet ( June 12, 1924 – February 13, 2000 ) was an American physicist and mathematician.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Cleet was born in Southam, Texas, on June 12, 1924, the son of the biologist August Cleet and his wife, Beverly Delacourt. Cleet's father was `` young, sweet, and courteous '', but his life was not quite the happiest. His mother died when Edwin was a baby. He was raised by his father, an electrical engineer from Bainbridge, Virginia, in a patriarchal family in the hamlet of Southam. He attended DeMatha College in Bethesda, Maryland, in the fall of 1951, and earned a B.S. degree in mathematics in 1956.  
 Cleet completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia University in New York City in 1957 with a thesis on additive dynamics, developed by Edward Harrison Sherman, known at Columbia as `` the father of space and elasticity ''.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After graduation, Cleet began work at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  
 He worked on exotic elasticity problems and `` thermodynamics ''. He was also an experimental physicist with the RAND Corporation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, specializing in theoretical problems and conducting investigations of spectral line integrals, the subharmonics of light, and photoelectricity.  
 In 1958 he developed a method for the detection of photon emissions from a particle accelerator under Columbia's Leonard Peebles Laboratory.Cleet's research work was interrupted by the Vietnam War. As a diplomat, Cleet enjoyed having his fingernails brushed by President Harry S. Truman and by fellow officers and astronauts. He earned his PhD at Columbia from 1955 to 1957 under the supervision of Alexander C. Hertzmann, a distinguished physicist at the Radcliffe Laboratory of Columbia University's Kennedy School of Government. In 1959, Cleet and Hertzmann returned to Brookhaven National Laboratory to join their students in the group `` Eliminating Impurities '', working on short-lived electromagnetic radiation from ionization. The study involved timing the emission of radio waves from a xenon source in a high-energy particle accelerator using no energy of the radioactive element uranium, but multiple sources, such as uranium-239, had previously been detected using similar methods. They presented their findings to the US Atomic Energy Commission at their request. The radiation observed by experimenters in 1965 is known as the Cleet–Hertzmann effect.  
   
 In 1966, Cleet became director of the Physical Measurement and Solid State Electronics Laboratory of Brookhaven National Laboratory, now known as the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1970 he became chairman of the Physical Measurement and Solid State Electronics Division at the National Bureau of Standards. In 1973, Cleet retired, but continued at Brookhaven for the next 14 years. He died in Miami, Florida, on February 13, 2000.Cleet received an honorary D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1974. He was awarded the Henry Draper Walker Distinguished Service Award in Science in 1986, the Bradbury Medal of the American Physical Society in 1997, and the Alpha Ceramidor Award of the American Physical Society in 1999.  
   
   
 == Honors ==  
 Awarded numerous international awards and honors, including the Award of the Linnean Society of London ( 1959 ), the Masson Medal of the International Organization of Radio Engineers ( 1982 ), the IFRAM Medal ( 1984 ), the World Physics Prize ( 1986 ), and the William Tyrrell Bell Award ( 1989 ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Cleet married his wife, Theresa De La Reineffle Cleet, in 1963. Together they were divorced in 1980. Cleet died at his home in Miami, Florida, on February 13, 2000. He is buried in Miami Gardens Cemetery.

 = Philip William Beard =  
Philip William Beard ( 11 September 1860 – 4 October 1947 ) was an English physicist and administrator, who spent most of his life at the University of Nottingham and was appointed vice-chancellor in 1949.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Beard was born on 11 September 1860 in Camberwell, Gloucestershire, the son of Rev George William Beard of Hotham Hall, Oxford. The eldest of four sons, he was the great-grandson of Dr. William the Silent, who was `` noted as a selfless philanthropist, prepared to sacrifice himself for the welfare of others ''. A blacksmith and taylor, he was educated at Holy Trinity School, Oxford, and graduated in 1874, going on to earn the degree of LL.B. in 1875.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1878, Beard became a lecturer in mechanical science at Manchester College ( then a public school in Manchester, England, which bears his name ). He held this post until 1884, when he was appointed deputy dean of engineering in Titchfield, England, where he continued until 1886. He was also professor of physical chemistry in Oxford.  
 Beard was well known for his work in the study of interplanetary motion, the determination of velocity and direction of sub-atomic particles, and his discovery of the vascular toad : a term he coined, arthropod.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Beard was born in Camberwell on 11 September 1860, the son of John John Beard, a linen merchant, and his wife, Sarah Kate. His mother, who was of Indian descent, had raised two daughters, Margaret ( now Margaret Beard ), a painter, and Adelia, a chorister and the first secretary of Oxford University's Lady's College, where Beard was educated. Beard's paternal grandparents were the industrialist John John Beard and his wife Caroline Grange Grey, daughter of James Grey, 1st Earl Grey. At his father's death in 1883, Philip Jr. was sent to spend his youth in the care of his aunt, the publisher Margaret Grainger, followed by a brief period at the Rancourt Senior Infirmary in Chertsey. In 1887, his aunt died, leaving him free to pursue his studies at Oxford. In 1890, he studied mathematics and physics, graduating B.A. in 1890. In 1892, he became a postgraduate, a post he held for a number of years. In 1895, he was appointed lecturer in mechanical science at Manchester College, which was then a public school. In 1895, he became vice-chancellor of the university and from 1897 until his retirement in 1953, he was Dean of Engineering. His son was Reginald John Beard ( 1885–1965 ), who was a senior in the Cambridge cricket team.After the First World War, Beard left the university for another six years to work as a civil engineer and engineer-in-residence at Bolton ( Norfolk ), before returning to Manchester in 1922. In 1924, he became the first vice-chancellor of Nottingham College, which, from then until 1950, was part of the University of Nottingham.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Beard's most important scientific contributions included the use of semipermeable mirrors to measure specific gravity. This led him to the discovery of the corpuscles of organisms. He was the author of extensively cited papers in the physical literature in which he calculated the possible migration of small particles at sub-microscopic velocities. This was then replicated, and was independently confirmed in 1928 by Mott, Mortimer and Shephard, and independently confirmed again in 1929 by Frank Buchan. In 1931, Beard also achieved international prominence when he suggested that James Clerk Maxwell's best estimate for the speed of light was actually 0.15 nanometres per second. He demonstrated in detail that Maxwell's estimate for the speed of light was an exact mathematical approximation.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 On 4 October 1947, Beard, 65, retired as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham. During his last few years at Nottingham, he was assisting the excavation of Newton's Great Tower. He was survived by his wife, sister, two sons and two daughters. His son Reginald Beard, also born at Nottingham, died of pneumonia in 1966, aged 31, at Nottingham General Hospital.

 = Jay Parikh =  
Jay Parikh ( 10 June 1913 – 30 December 1997 ) was a Canadian civil servant and president of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. He led a committee to review the industry-wide broadcasting regulations.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jay Parikh was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Parikh married Pat ( née Muellen ), who worked for the Winnipeg Sons of Sweden, and Förster. He served in the navy for 16 years and was stationed in Japan during World War II, and then Canada's Ministry of Communications ( now Ministry of Foreign Affairs ), during which time he received a Master of Arts from the University of Manitoba. He returned to Winnipeg to attend university, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in psychology in 1941. He completed his Master of Science in 1942 and became a private in the reserves. In the summer of 1944 he joined the navy as a ship's draftsman.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === First trade union chief ===  
 Parikh joined the Winnipeg Federation of Labour in 1948 as the director of the training section for the city's military draft board. In 1956 he became its national executive council, and eventually became its chief executive in the spring of 1960. He was superintendent of the press office from 1961 to 1968 and president of the Winnipeg Public Libraries from 1968 to 1972. Parikh led the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission from 1976 to 1977, and in 1981 he became the commissioner for competition. The annual Cribfest was renamed by him as `` Jay Parikh Cribfest '' in his honour.  
   
   
 === Law Department ===  
 At age 50, Parikh joined the law faculty at the University of Winnipeg to broaden his knowledge of Canadian law. Parikh retired as professor in 1983 and was succeeded by his son Peter Parikh. He was a recipient of the Knight, Order of Canada, twice, in 1962 and 1965.In his later life, Parikh is said to have been `` a perfectly placid and articulate person. ''  
   
   
 === Public Service ===  
   
 Parikh was appointed director of the Ministry of Labour's Industry Section in 1959 and elected as a trustee of the Bank of Canada ( Bocorp ) in 1966. He was Canada's first president of the Communications Workers of America ( CWA ), a government agency whose purpose was to encourage unionization in the construction of wireless systems. The company laid off some 4,000 workers during the 1963 strike, and sent them to the Republican Auditorium in Toronto to prepare a bill that would repeal the 1963 legislation which had done so much to weaken the collective bargaining rights of workers. When Parikh learned about the outcome of the strike, he invited members of the AWA who had been drafted by the strikers to his home in Toronto and stated that they would not be receiving any retribution if they stayed in Canada. In 1978 Parikh advised the government of Quebec not to renew its contract with the industry section, which was due to expire after a decade of operation. Parikh advised the government that the province had the power to terminate the contract on its own. Parikh supported the repeal of the Radio Act in 1977, and he again urged the provincial government not to do so. In 1977 the entire board of directors of CWA, including Parikh, resigned to save CWA $ 19 million.In 1982 Parikh was named president of the CBC Broadcasting Commission. He became a member of the Commission's board in 1984 and of its executive committee in 1985.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Parikh died at home in Winnipeg in 1997. He is best known for `` Jay Parikh's '' criticism of the Canadian Broadcasting Act which he helped to codify and was a key voice in removing from its Canadian text, amendments to which he helped orchestrate. The CBC later cited him as being part of the design team responsible for overhauling the Act.

She bred iris herself and is credited with helping to introduce a new class , the miniature tall bearded iris . She is one of only a dozen people to have received the AIS Gold Medal , the society 's highest honor , and she was also awarded the Gold Medal of the British Iris Society for her paintings of iris .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Ethel Anson Steel was born in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , on November 30 , 1879 , to William White Garrigues Steel and Juliet ( Rauch ) Steel . She was educated at private schools in England.In 1906 , she married Wheeler Hazard Peckham , with whom she had two children , Content and Anson . They lived in New Rochelle , New York.In 1920 Peckham helped to establish both the American Iris Society and its first trial garden , which was located at the New York Botanical Garden ( NYBG ) . She continued to be involved with both organizations throughout her life . At NYBG , she was named honorary curator of both the iris and narcissus collections in 1927 . She was a contributor to the NYBG 's Journal and also to another of its publications , Addisonia.At the AIS , she held the post of director for a decade ( 1925–35 ) , during which period she also had charge of the AIS test gardens . She took over management of the AIS 's preliminary checklists and compiled and edited the monumental 1929 and 1939 lists , comprising 12,000 and 19,000 species , cultivars , and their synonyms , respectively . This was an important undertaking at the time , when irises were growing in popularity as American garden plants but their nomenclature was in disarray.Peckham also served to different times as the society 's registrar and its recorder , and she developed the AIS 's first set of rules for judging iris , thus making it possible for iris competitions to be held using nationally agreed standards.Peckham was one of the first breeders to carefully study dwarf irises and brought a thousand dwarf iris into the New York Botanical Garden . She is credited with helping to develop a new class , the miniature tall bearded irises , which she appreciated for their potential as cut flowers . She termed them 'table irises ' and provided the first description of the class . She introduced at least five new cultivars of intermediate bearded irises and at least 60 of tall bearded irises.She served for a time as the director of the Horticultural Society of New York.She also lectured around the country on horticultural topics and contributed to gardening magazines.She died February 23 , 1965 .

Paul Joseph ( Piotr ) Russell, ( also known as Maksim Șiăn ) ( July 27, 1919 – August 6, 2003 ) was a Romanian physicist. He was an eminent teacher, administrator and social and cultural influence. He was also a key researcher in the field of cosmology.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Education ===  
   
 Paul Russell was born in Pişmen, the son of Cyril and Mathilde Russell. He studied physics at Bucharest University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1931. He then enrolled in the newly founded University of Bucharest in 1934, and completed his Ph.D. in physics in 1936 with the thesis `` The effect of the hydrogen-air mixture in a magnetosphere ''. He continued teaching, attending seminars on magnetic and aeronautics as a guest lecturer. As a graduate student in the same year, he also became a full professor.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 After graduating, he accepted an appointment as an associate professor in the physics department at the Faculty of Science in Bucharest. He soon became a professor, and in 1957, a full professor. The school's successor, the Faculty of Technology, in 1960 became his alma mater. He was also appointed as the Acting Head of the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science. He held this position until 1973, and as an honorary professor until 1979. He died in Bucharest in 2003.  
   
   
 === Research ===  
   
 He is best known for his research in the application of nuclear magnetic resonance in optical and radio astronomy, where he applied theories from quantum mechanics to the analysis of motion in galaxies. The problem was posed by the implication of static electricity-magnetic fields on the observed motion of binary stars. In its most basic form, he concluded that these fields, caused by interactions of strong and weak magnetic fields on nearby stars, produce electromagnetic structures not observed in observed stellar systems.Russell's work on the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) inspired two subsequent cosmological textbooks, one written by Georges Rolland-Barthaume at the University of Grenoble in 1946 and another by Mihail Feugelé in 1952. In the latter he presented a better analysis of the cosmic microwave background, and he was awarded the chair at the Romanian Academy of Sciences in 1967. He also had an influential academic contribution in terms of the aesthetics of cosmology, resulting in his The Mainframe Geometrical Architecture ( 1958 ) and Interaction of Atomic Fields ( 1965 ).The discovery of neutrinos in 1977 challenged the model of Russell and Feugelé that neutrinos are particles bound together by a metal nucleus ( or antiferromagnet ), as was thought previously. However, neutrinos can also be seen as `` invisible '' particles, often appearing in low amounts, and have been dubbed dark matter. The discovery was the culmination of 28 years of work by B.S.E. Russell and M.S.M. Feugelé, which he was initially unaware of, and which led him to form an entirely new paradigm regarding neutrinos.  
 He also created a magnetic time-averaging station in Pescăişnă, which used external measuring instruments for its measurements, and was considered to be the first such time-averaging station in the world.  
   
   
 == Awards ==  
 In 1968, he received the Dr. Petro-Sangaran Prize ( an award from the Romanian Academy of Sciences ), of the Division of Educational Research. In the same year he received the G. Lucescu-Sinc or William E. Creighton Award ( awarded by the Linnean Society of Edinburgh ), the world's most prestigious international recognition for discovering a new science. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the Royal Society in 1992, and elected a Foreign Member of the American Physical Society in 1999. In 1983, he received the Costa Medal, awarded to outstanding Romanian scientists. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, Royal Academy of Sciences of Bucharest ( Romanian : ( Nămenhora Bucharest ) Romanieții ) ( Zagăbul ) ( or Aristeza Bucharest ), and his name is inscribed on the Pantheon of Rome, with the title of Paul Christian Russell.

Sir Neil Chamberlain ( 23 April 1919 – 22 September 2007 ) was a British engineer, naturalist and mountaineer. A member of the Society of the Explorers of the Sky, Chamberlain was an observer of meteorites, and a friend and mentor of John Mackenzie. His scientific interest in these objects led him to commission photographs of the local stars at all hours of the day to be able to provide him with an annual grant of £100, which he used to travel to Antarctica. In 1972 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Chamberlain was born in Alderley, Devon. After winning a scholarship to Aberystwyth High School in 1947, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1952, graduating with First Class honours in that subject in 1958. During the Second World War he was discharged as a second lieutenant in the British Army for good behaviour but continued studying meteorites from 1950 to 1966.  
 During the 1960s, he worked as a young engineer on projects for the British Geological Survey ( GGS ), spending most of the time travelling in Africa, where he contributed to the technical information produced by the USGS Meteorite Mapping Project in Zimbabwe. He then returned to Cambridge where he served as a research associate with the GGS from 1965 to 1970, before returning to a family connection with local biology, and travelling with his father on holiday from 1966 to 1968 to observe the effects of ageing on Tasmanian rock beetles. While still at Cambridge, he joined the University of Witwatersrand and did post-doctoral work at the University of Cape Town as an assistant in mathematics and the history of science.  
   
   
 == Work and personal life ==  
 Chamberlain became friends with John McGarry Mackenzie, and continued to correspond with him over the next couple of decades, focusing on the research projects which Mackenzie had embarked upon with high precision. In 1978, he was awarded the International Society of Mineralogy award.In 1978, Chamberlain was admitted to the Saint Luke's Hospital in Manchester for treatment of the brain tumour he had contracted during a climactic expedition in the winter of 1984–85. In 1986, he left Cambridge for a two-week respite at the base camp in French Polynesia, at the invitation of the Ministry of Culture. Two months later, the brain tumour had recurred and Chamberlain developed septicaemia. In 1987, he was given a nursing home stay at Norwood Lodge, Crewe. In 1991, he was admitted to King's College London for treatment of kidney stones. In 1993, he was admitted to the Tufts Medical Center at the MedStar hospital in Boston and died on 22 September 2007.  
   
   
 == Awards and recognition ==  
 From the Diftschrift he received in 1977, he received the Owen Houlihan Memorial Award ( 1977 ) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Awards ( 1982 ). In 1990, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ). He was knighted in 2000. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1983. He received the Dalsley Copley Medal of the Astronomical Society of London in 1990 and the George Mathews Award of the Geological Society of London in 1994. He received a Copley Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Great Britain in 1989. In 2004, he was elected an international member of the ICM.  
 In November 2004, the Meteorite Building in the David Attenborough Centre at Svalbard was dedicated to Neil Chamberlain by Sir Patrick Stewart, Director of the newly created British Antarctic Survey. The monument is `` dedicated to the memory of Sir Neil Chamberlain who made significant contributions to the search for and the discovery of new exo-vegetations of Earth, the crystallisation of distant meteors and the identification of so-called 'bottleneck stars'- those only dim asteroids to be found far from the Sun '' and is named after a Copley Medal awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society.In December 2009, the Department of the Interior and International Development published an editorial on Chamberlain's life, work and achievements in Mountaineering and Meteorites under the title `` Neil Chamberlain, X-ray crystallographer ''.

 = Angelo Mosso =   
Angelo Mosso ( 30 May 1846 – 24 November 1910 ) is the 19th century Italian physiologist who invented the first neuroimaging technique ever , known as 'human circulation balance'.Mosso began by recording the pulsation of the human cortex in patients with skull defects following neurosurgical procedures . From his findings that these pulsations change during mental activity , he inferred that during mental activities blood flow increases to the brain . Remarkably , Mosso invented the 'human circulation balance ' , only recently rediscovered , to non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity also in healthy subjects : this is therefore regarded as the first neuroimaging technique ever , forerunner of the more refined techniques of FMRI , and PET.He was born in Turin , studied medicine there and in Florence , Leipzig , and Paris , and was appointed professor of pharmacology ( 1876 ) and professor of physiology ( 1879 ) at Turin . He invented various instruments to measure the pulse and experimented and wrote upon the variation in the volume of the pulse during sleep , mental activity , or emotion . In 1900–01 he visited the United States and embodied the results of his observations in Democrazia nella religione e nella scienza : studi sull ' America ( 1901 ) . In 1882 he founded with Emery the Archives Italiennes de Biologie , in which journal most of his essays appeared . Among his other works are :

 = Hermann Inzlicht =  
Hermann Inzlicht ( 7 January 1877 – 6 July 1953 ) was a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist. Inzlicht was a physician and medical author. Inzlicht is best known for his expertise in antisemitic literature and art therapy, with particular emphasis on the experience of a Jew.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Inzlicht was born in Leipzig, the son of a Dr. Albrecht Inzlicht ( 1841-1899 ) and his wife Eva Gertrude Thomas. His paternal grandfather was an anti-Nazi war criminal. He was involved in the University of Leipzig from 1897 to 1907. As a student, he spent some time in Düsseldorf ( 1912 ), with his friend Franz Haumbach ( 1884-1955 ). While in Düsseldorf, Inzlicht decided to study philosophy, entering the faculty of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt-am-Main ( where he spent the following two years ). He then moved on to the Berlin Medical School ( 1910-1913 ), where he was one of the founders of the Department of Psychology. In his doctoral thesis, he had failed to notice a clear difference in the personalities of adults with great negative experiences who received light therapy from Kurt Eisner and others, and those with negative experiences who received heavy therapy from Wolfgang Tillich. He also referred to psychotherapy as a mode of intervention. He taught at the University of Basel, the State University of Munich and the Albert Einstein University of Frankfurt-am-Main.  
 Inzlicht was the founder of the biopharmacological research group of Prof. Achille Turchenberg, who helped establish the family practice `` Inzlicht '' for neuropsychiatric patients, with whom he made the distinction between psychotic disorders and non-psychiatric hypomanic disorders. He also contributed articles to Rudolf Neruda's Phantasie, concerning the cerebral basis of mental disorders ( Trans. World. Biol. Mag. 75, 53-60, 1911 ). Inzlicht also published L ’ année privée des nightmares ( 1925 ) and Matériel sur les lettres psychoses ( 1934 ).In the latter of these two publications he established a `` second 'path of light''' for schizophrenia patients, and that of hypomania.  
 His last name is the Biblical Christoph Inzlicht from Jerusalem, which is the name of his beloved daughter and many of his famous works.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Inzlicht was the author of the preface to Kurt Eisner's Psychotherapy : The History of a Radical Therapy ( 1920 ). The English translation was published posthumously in 1934 as A Psychoanalytic Guide to Psychoanalysis, with the American Psychoanalytic Association, and Inzlicht ’ s latter name was bestowed upon the English title of Professor L ’ année privée des nightmares. His new English translation published posthumously in 1944 is The Book of Jewish Satires and the Language of Chrestomania.

He made first ascents of many peaks and routes in the Rocky Mountains , particularly in Colorado , including Lizard Head in the San Juan Mountains , Ellingwood Ridge on La Plata Peak in the Sawatch Range , and Crestone Needle in the Sangre de Cristo Range . Many mountain features are named for him , on peaks such as Middle Teton , on which Ellingwood made the first ascent , the Ellingwood Ridge of La Plata Peak , and the Ellingwood Arete ascent of Crestone Needle ; the fourteener Ellingwood Point , near Blanca Peak in southern Colorado , is named for him as well.The brave pioneer of previously unattempted climbs died prematurely at the age of 46 . At that time he was assistant dean at Northwestern University . Ellingwood was a Rhodes Scholar and was a professor of political science at Colorado College . At the time of his death during a medical procedure , he was Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Northwestern University . Contrasting with the brevity of his life is the longevity of his climbing companion Eleanor Ehrman née Davis ( 1885-1993 ) . Their `` firsts '' in climbs included the aforementioned Crestone Needle 1916 and again by the arete in 1925 . In 1923 they made the first ascent of the South Teton as well the 3rd or 4th ascent of the Grand Teton .

He was primarily interested in stratigraphy , but was also responsible in large part for mapping the geology of the USSR.The son of a mining engineer , Nalivkin was born in St. Petersburg in 1889 , and followed his father 's footsteps by entering the local Mining Academy in 1907 . During his training he began teaching there , and also became involved in fieldwork expeditions in the Caucasus and Central Asia . Early work dealt with Devonian brachiopods in the Kyrgyzstan portion of the Fergana Valley , and he retained an interest in this geological period throughout his career .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 He received the A. P. Karpinsky Distinguished Award in 1913 for one of his papers on faunal composition , and this provided him with the means to go to the Russian Biological Station in Villefranche ( France ) to study mollusks . By 1915 Nalivkin was considered an expert in central Asian geology . He was asked by the Russian Geographical Society to lead an expedition to study ancient glaciations in the Pamir . Their results of their study confirmed traces of two ancient glaciations , as well as producing a stratigraphic succession and the completion of a tectonic map . Nalivkin was awarded the Small Silver Medal of the Geographical Society in recognition of his leadership of the expedition . He was called to military service in 1917 , and following demobilisation in late 1917 , returned to his studies of Devonian fauna.In 1917 he was elected to the Geological Commission of Russia , and remained with it for more sixty years . During his tenure with the Commission he was responsible for directing research into palaeontology , sedimentology and stratigraphy , work which led to the development and extraction of resources such as coal , ores and petroleum .   
 He completed his doctorate in 1924 and was appointed a Professor at the Saint Petersburg Mining University . During World War II , his research extended to a search for bauxite as a means of assisting the war effort 's need for aircraft metals.His most significant contribution came with the creation of the index geological maps of the USSR ( and adjacent regions ) , which attracted considerable international attention . With the completion of his Geological Map of the USSR ( 1:2,500,000 scale ) he was awarded the prestigious Lenin Prize in 1957 .

In 1860 he participated in the Erfurt conference that would lead to Julie von Massow 's Ut Omnes Unum movement , which sought the reunification of Catholicism with Protestantism.In his writings , Michelis attempted to reconcile the teachings of Plato and those of modern science with the doctrines of Roman Catholicism . In 1866/7 , he was prominent in the Prussian Diet as an opponent of Otto von Bismarck 's ecclesiastical policy . But he also opposed the influence of the Jesuits and the dogma of papal infallibility in several pamphlets ( 1869–70 ) , which led to his excommunication.Michelis was a major figure in the `` Old Catholic '' movement in Germany , and from 1874 was associated with Old Catholic parish at Freiburg . As a philosopher he was an opponent of materialism , and an outspoken critic of Darwinism and Güntherianism . For a period of time , he was editor of the journal Natur und Offenbarung ( Nature and Epiphany ) . He also edited Der Katholik , an organ especially directed against the Jesuits .

Robert David Girey ( 9 January 1916 – 22 February 2009 ) was an English cartographer, author, and historian.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Girey was born at Lewes, Surrey. He was educated at Peterhouse Grammar School and the Royal School of Mines and graduated in 1938. In 1941 he married Anne Frances Colquhoun, a psychologist and geography lecturer. After an extended period working as an RAF officer, he began as a lecturer in 1948 and taught geography at Dalkeith College, University of Cambridge. From 1952 to 1954 he was an assistant lecturer in art history at the University of Kent, and from 1954 to 1959 he was a lecturer in political science at the University of St Andrews. During this period he also lectured at Girton College, where he was named curator in 1959.  
 He began work on Girey's Atlas of The World in the late 1950s. A drawing of the Soviet Union was published the same year as his first printed book. That publication became the basis for his `` Perspectives of Geography '', in 1961. This second book brought into focus the long-standing `` sequence of world events '' concept, which still informs Girey's writings on world events, with all the elements of history occurring in successive sequential times. Girey also develops a dynamic metaphor, which applies to specific periods within a country, the paradigm for which he is the first to explain in his book.  
   
   
 == Historical Girey ==  
 In 1961 he was appointed Chief Historian at the Land Office, and a year later became the Curator of World Geography. His official title was then `` Chief Examiner of Records '', although as curator he was also `` Chairman of the National Planning Board ''. He was invited to the editorial boards of 16 national and international professional journals : the British Geographical Association, the Land and Oceanography and Geographic Survey Journal, the Royal Statistical Society, the London Geographic Association and the Royal Aeronautical Society. He also worked for the British Council and other institutions. From 1969 he was appointed Visiting Professor at the University of East Anglia. Girey wrote the book Notes on Wartime Latitudes, during which time he also provided detailed calculations for the geocentric expansion of the United Kingdom.  
 As chairman of the steering committee for the East Anglia Regional Council he was one of the founders of the East Anglia Geographical and Planning Council, and was tasked with `` managing the planning of East Anglia's extensive internal reserves. '' While at East Anglia Girey set up and headed a series of centres for Asia Studies at the University of London, which he oversaw from 1967 to 1974. The plan, called `` five'sites''', included Ananda University, with a research department focused on development, the Indian Institute of Geography, the Indian Institute of Science, the Geographical Research Institute ( GRI ), and the East Anglia Urban and Regional Research Institute ( EARRI ). The EARRI was the centre for regional development research, where Girey mentored the future historian Oliver Sacks. Girey's `` six sites '' were linked to the Chinese civil war, and covered Angkor Wat, Minchung, Pyongyang, Timurid North, Changsha and Beijing. While in Hong Kong he held a professorship in the history of China, specialising in the history of Chinese antiquity.  
 The artist John Barth designed Girey's research institute of East Anglia, and contributed artworks to his Atlas of The World. He was nominated for the National Geographical and Environmental-Natural History Museum ( NGEM ), after being one of the only six European thinkers to receive a Fellowship.

 = Bernardino Drovetti =   
Bernardino Michele Maria Drovetti ( January 7 , 1776 – March 5 , 1852 ) was an Italian antiquities collector , diplomat , and politician . He is best remembered for having acquired the Turin Royal Canon and for his questionable behavior in collecting ancient Egyptian antiquities .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in Barbania , a comune near Turin in the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia , Drovetti later obtained the French nationality and joined the Grande Armée . As an official , during the French campaign in Egypt ( 1798–99 ) he distinguished himself by saving the life of Joachim Murat , and later he became the French Consul-General of Egypt during both the Empire ( until 1814 ) and the Bourbon Restoration , between 1820 and 1829 . He also earned Wāli Muhammad Ali 's trust and had a role in some of the latter 's administrative reforms . In 1820 he was awarded the title of Chevalier dans l'Ordre de la Legion d'Honneur.During his stay in Egypt , Drovetti became a passionate and avid collector of Egyptian antiquities . He engaged several agents and was particularly active in Luxor ; shortly he gathered huge amounts of findings which he managed to sell in Europe . His first collection was refused by France , but was acquired by King Charles Felix of Sardinia in 1824 and carried to Turin , where it became the first core of the future Museo Egizio . Another collection was purchased by King Charles X of France and is now stored at the Louvre . A third one was acquired by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1836 and carried in Prussia in order of being accommodated in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin . Among the antiquities sold to the King of Sardinia there was the invaluable Turin Royal Canon , a papyrus bearing a list of several pharaohs which is datable to the reign of Ramesses II and which was found by Drovetti at Luxor in 1820 .   
 Later in his life , Drovetti lost his mind and was confined in a lunatic asylum at Turin . He died there in March 5 , 1852 .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 While he contributed significantly to the creation of three of the largest Egyptological collections in Europe and substantially increased the European interest in ancient Egypt , Drovetti is also remembered for his ruthlessness towards other collectors and excavators . He was particularly hostile against Henry Salt , Giovanni Battista Belzoni and Jean-François Champollion : for example , during his excavations at Luxor around 1818 and later , Belzoni reported to have been harassed by two of Drovetti 's agents , Antonio Lebolo and a certain Rosignani ; Drovetti also tried several times to hinder Champollion 's expedition in Egypt ( 1827–28 ) , likely to prevent a competitor in his affairs . Drovetti and his agents were also deemed careless and unscrupulous in their conduct towards their discoveries , and it is believed that the fragmentary state of the Turin Royal Canon is at least partially due to this behavior .

 Drovetti was portrayed by Joseph Long in the 2005 BBC docudrama Egypt .

Moritz von Rohr ( 4 April 1868 – 20 June 1940 ) was an optical scientist at Carl Zeiss in Jena , Germany .   
 A street in Jena is named after him : Moritz-von-Rohr-Straße , near Carl-Zeiss-Promenade and Otto-Schott-Straße .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Moritz von Rohr was born in Lonzyn near Hohensalza , then part of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen , but now in Poland and known as Łążyn , near Inowrocław . He obtained a doctorate of philosophy at the University of Berlin in 1892 .   
    
    
 == Inventions ==   
 Von Rohr is usually credited with the design of the first aspheric lenses for eyeglasses . He invented the eyeglass lens designs that became the Zeiss Punktal lenses .   
 He also developed a method of computing depth of field from a camera 's entrance pupil location and diameter , without reference to focal length and f-number ( see his 1904 and 1906 books ) . He says , `` At this point it will be sufficient to note that all these formulae involve quantities relating exclusively to the entrance-pupil and its position with respect to the object-point , whereas the focal length of the transforming system does not enter into them . '' T. R. Dallmeyer refers to Von Rohr ’ s `` interpretation '' of depth of field in his 1899 book Telephotography .   
    
    
 == Publications ==   
 According to the Focal Encyclopedia of Photography ( 1965 ) , `` A bibliography of his 571 books and articles was published in Forschungen zur Geschichte der Optik , 1943 . ''   
 Von Rohr wrote several books on optics , optical instruments , and photographic lenses , in German .

 In 1836 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna , where in 1864 he became a full professor .   
 He is remembered for his pioneer investigations of the central nervous system , particularly his studies involving nerve fiber localization , direction and degeneration . His name is lent to the `` bundle of Türck '' , which are uncrossed fibers forming a small bundle in the pyramidal tract . Today this bundle of fibers is usually called by its clinical name : the anterior corticospinal tract . In medical literature , the terms `` Türck 's bundle '' , `` Türck 's column '' and `` Türck 's tract '' are also used for the anterior corticospinal tract.During the latter part of the 1850s , Türck , along with physiologist Johann Nepomuk Czermak ( 1828-1873 ) were responsible for introducing the laryngoscope into medicine . Among Türck 's assistants and students in Vienna were laryngologists Karl Stoerk ( 1832-1899 ) , Leopold von Schrötter ( 1837-1908 ) and Johann Schnitzler ( 1835-1893 ) .

William Langhorne ( 1796–1855 ) was a British writer and naturalist. His books, including the first ( 1848 ) and third ( 1855 ) editions of The Naturalist's Companion, comprise a treasure trove of information on natural history and botany. Most of the works are illustrated with illustrations and numerous illustrations and footnotes.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Langhorne was born on 17 June 1796 in Oldham, Berkshire. His father was William Langhorne, member of the Jury and Coroner of Yorkshire, where his uncle, the Reverend Henry Whitestone, was deputy chaplain. Langhorne's uncle was professor of Natural History to King George VI at Whitehall. Langhorne's mother was Nelly, widow of Joshua I. They had four children.  
 His father, who was with him during the First and Second English Civil Wars, died in 1811, while William was seven years old. William was adopted by his maternal grandmother Margaret - who had no interest in children or relatives. They continued to live in the old Ludlow Avenue mansion, four miles ( 6.6 km ) east of the town of Oldham, next door to Oldham Castle.  
 Langhorne graduated from Woolwich High School in January 1811, and his education was interrupted by two years in the service of the 'South West Cantonment School'before he was a pupil at Bolton School in 1812. He then joined the Cadets'Company, under the command of George Preston. Langhorne went on to serve in Company A, 9th Cambridge Regiment, which fought in the First Anglo-Norman War of 1812. He then attended Maida Vale School, and entered the University of London as a student, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1815. He soon left for Dartmouth College, and remained there for the rest of his life.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Langhorne was a member of the 6th Company, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, was appointed secretary to the Colonial Council, and was President of Dartmouth College from 1817 to 1819. He also assisted by forming the first botanical club there, in 1818. In the 1830s, he began publishing monthly magazine Natural Journal, before becoming a notable writer, notably the Naturalist's Companion, which he continued until 1851. It comprises a collection of Charles Darwin's essays, collected from his books. The first 1848 edition contains all of his books, while the 3rd edition contains his own work on plants. Langhorne wrote editorials on science, such as the one published in The Naturalist's Companion, and also contributed books for children.  
 He had a heart attack at his home in Oldham in 1856. The author of the article he published entitled The Entire Life of William Henry Owen by Hever Francis Lee in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia published by the University of Pennsylvania, briefly described him as `` the most active man in East Anglia at the present time '', saying that his thoroughness as a writer may surpass that of any man, `` likely to occupy more space than any book written in the English language '', and that he is also noted for the `` powerful readership '' and `` rich variety '' of essays and notes he amassed in his editorship of Natural Journal.

 = Dorothy Kaurek =  
Dorothy Marie Kaurek ( December 23, 1872 – November 14, 1961 ) was an American entomologist known for her studies of centipedes and lice, her contributions to the observation and description of the term `` crabs '' in the natural sciences and for her research in the field of parasitology. She was the first woman and the first woman physician in Pennsylvania and the first to become a professor of parasitology in the United States at the University of Pennsylvania in 1913.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Dorothy Kaurek was born to Christine Catherine Lowrey on December 23, 1872, and was the oldest child of her parents, the poet and teacher Mary Taylor Kaurek ( 1819–1900 ), and her older sister Ida Mae Taylor Lowrey ( 1844–1913 ). Dorothy married Henry Allen Kaurek on September 18, 1881. They had three sons : Lawrence ( 1882-1961 ), Donald ( 1890-1935 ) and Darlene ( 1898-1953 ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Dorothy was a regular student of botany at Pennsylvania College, and then pursued a position teaching biology at Oberlin College in Ohio before returning to PA College in 1895, where she joined the teaching faculty and opened a full-time course in insect ecology. In 1898, she was awarded a master's degree in zoology from Oberlin College, and became a doctor of botany with the degree in 1901. She taught classes in biology and zoology for four years at Oberlin College. In the summer of 1911, Dorothy Kaurek graduated as first woman of color to receive a doctorate in biology at Oberlin. She was promoted to associate professor, and taught two additional years at Oberlin. Between the years 1902 and 1909, Dorothy Kaurek served as a university lecturer and as a member of the department of biological sciences. She chaired the biological investigations committee of the Pennsylvania State Entomological Society and was one of the five women to serve as president of the Society for Experimental Biology, the international scientific organization for comparative anatomy. After the dissolution of the Society in 1911, she became president of the Pennsylvania Entomological Society. She was an annual recipient of the Frederic A. Stotz Award for her professional achievements in biology.During World War I, Kaurek was a conscientious objector. When she returned to the United States in 1922, she moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and resumed teaching biology there, but she later returned to PA and opened a practice in Philadelphia. In 1925, Dorothy Kaurek was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in scientific studies of beetles, and founded a course in parasitology for students and professionals in that subject.  
   
   
 == Life as a scientist ==  
   
   
 === Research ===  
 In her research, Kaurek focused on the life history of Centipedeidae and Lepidoptera. When she became the first woman in the country to be awarded a doctorate in her biological field, she was joined in her career by two colleagues, the entomologist and parasitologist Irving Berlin ( 1858–1941 ) and the entomologist and teacher Dr. Joseph Glass ( 1860–1954 ). While working with Berlin, the pair of them combined knowledge of experimental zoology and parasitology to identify new terms in biology, and sought to use these terms as means of educating the general public in that area. Although Kaurek began her career as a botanical entomologist, she did her pioneering work in the field of parasitology as a biology lecturer and scientific reporter.  
 Kaurek's first publication, published in the Journal of the Pennsylvania Entomological Society ( 1901 ), contained a small selection of concepts and definitions for the specific names of new invertebrate taxa.  
   
   
 === Later life ===  
 Following her doctoral degree, Kaurek taught botany at Oberlin College for twenty years and became a professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1913. She remained there until her retirement in 1947. She served as one of the trustees of the Pennsylvania Entomological Society from 1935 to 1943. In 1943, she received the Helen Peterson Cole Award from the American Entomological Society. She died in Philadelphia at the age of ninety-one. She was the daughter of American poet and teacher Darlene Maria ( Walker ) Lowrey.

 = Henry E. Grant =  
Henry E. Grant ( December 18, 1930 – August 25, 2006 ) was an American environmental historian who founded and directed the Department of Comparative Environmental Studies ( CEDS ) at Harvard University, whose `` Meteorological Investigations for the Northwestern Adirondacks '' was a standard source of research on Arctic forest and its ecology for the entire United States. In 1976, the CEDS Institute at Harvard University was renamed the Geophysical Laboratory.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Grant was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the second of four children of Merritt and Wessie Grant. The younger of the two boys, Henry became a student in the meteorology department at University of Minnesota, where he later received his B.S. in 1955. During his undergraduate years, he was in part the first to record the temperature of every Minnesota storm in depth-borough charts and with Robert Rudner. He earned his Master's in meteorology from Pennsylvania State University in 1961. While a graduate student he also studied the geographic patterns of boundary layer cold-air circulation, taking the annual instrumental record of the annual northern flow of air in mid-latitude basins. He was the main author of the 1982 book Climatic Research in the Northwestern Adirondacks ( now CEDS International ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Grant worked as an adjunct professor at New York University, graduating as the Ray F. Powell Lecturer in 1948 and then later a visiting professor of meteorology and environmental geography at the Harvard Extension School. He became an associate professor at New York University in 1957 and was assistant director of the National Climate Center in 1966. Grant also served as the Dean of New York University's Department of Geography in 1974, and later as the first provost of Harvard University.  
   
   
 == Retirement ==  
 In 1991, Grant retired from Harvard. A year later, he was a Visiting Professor of Geography at Harvard University's Stern School of Business, where he gave lectures on sustainability of economies and politics, climate change, and the history of scientific and academic study. In 1999 he delivered the George Eastman Award to study the geomagnetism of the Atlantic Ocean.Grant died of a heart attack on August 25, 2006, at his home in Harvard Yard, aged 93. The weather historian David Simon, in his book Killing Time : The Forgotten Art of Declining the Weather, described Grant as `` one of the great national environmental explorers '' and as `` a scientist with a laser focus on ancient knowledge, and a fine opinion of geography ''.  
   
   
 == CEDS ==  
 Grant's renowned 1978 book Climatic Research in the Northwestern Adirondacks ( now CEDS International ) was a landmark account of the history of the atmospheric sciences and geography as well as the importance of survey methods in climatological investigations. He was the co-author of one of the original 32 chapters, and the nature editor of three more. After reviewing 120 articles, many of them of particular interest to scientists and policy makers, Grant left them to several colleagues and conducted a complementary study. In his journal article `` Contributions of Reference Aerosol '', Grant wrote : `` the meteorological survey field program of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) includes a cloud and precipitation survey of the western United States.... [ the Mapp land-fog and cross section studies ] explore large land areas without visibility or consistent sky conditions. It should be possible to extract observations suitable for use in spatial descriptive climatology. ''

John Leonard Riddell ( February 20 , 1807 – October 7 , 1865 ) was a science lecturer , botanist , geologist , medical doctor , chemist , microscopist , numismatist , politician , and science fiction author in the United States . He was born in Leyden , Massachusetts , the son of John Riddell and Lephe Gates . He received his B.A . and M.A . at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from professor Amos Eaton and his M.D . from Cincinnati College in 1836 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Prior to receiving his M.D . Riddell found himself in Marietta , Ohio to study with Dr. Hildreth of Marietta College . As there were not many opportunities for a paid lecturer or a trained botanist he put out 'advertisements in local newspapers ' publicizing that he would collect plants for sale . He eventually published , in the Western Republican , one of the first botanical collections made in Ohio by a professional botanist . The specimens were donated to Marietta College and the Hildreth Herbarium . The collection was not adequately preserved and has been destroyed but the lists themselves remain.He lectured in Ogdensburg , New York , and then in Philadelphia and Cincinnati . From 1836 until his death in 1865 , he was Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of Louisiana ( now Tulane University ) in New Orleans . While there , he invented the first practical microscope to enable binocular viewing of objects through a single objective lens . In 1850 , he also undertook one of the earliest and most extensive American microscopic investigations of cholera.Riddell published a science fiction story giving an account of a fictional former student named Orrin Lindsay , who traveled to the moon and Mars.Following his botanical explorations of Texas , he was appointed melter and refiner of the New Orleans Mint , a position confirmed by President John Tyler following an internal mint dispute . He likewise was appointed Postmaster of New Orleans , which position he held even during the Civil War despite Confederate appointments intended to displace him.Active in local and state politics , he seems to have claimed to have been elected Governor of Louisiana in November , 1863 and sworn in by a justice of the peace in January , 1864 . During this time the military Governor George F. Shepley was still in actual power . His governorship was rejected in the course of a Congressional inquiry into a contested election in the House .

His essay `` Notes on the Anatomy of the Outer Branches of the Human Body '' was published in Medical Magazine in 1884 and other works, including A Dictionary of Medical Terms, are named in his honor.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 George Henry White was born in 1828, in Charlton-le-Spring, near Herefordshire. He was educated at the local grammar school. He then worked for a year as a physician for one of the local medical firms.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 In 1859, White worked at St Kilda's Hospital, London. He was appointed as an assistant to William Gurney at the Somerville Hospital in 1866. White undertook further studies at the Bristol General Hospital from 1865 to 1867. After a tour of Italy in 1868, White returned to London to work as a medical examiner, before serving for the next four years at Grenfell's Hospital, where he was also the junior practitioner. In 1873 he was called to teach in the Medical Institute of Surgeons at Stockport, London, and two years later moved to Edinburgh, being in charge of New College Hospital there, graduating there in 1876. White was chosen to teach obstetrics and gynaecology at St Mary's Hospital in Edinburgh in 1883.  
 In the early 1880s, White was a member of a team of anatomy students from London University which included Maria Sarah Stewart, who became world-famous for her drawings of the human skeleton. These original sketches and their commentary on anatomy and physiology caused a sensation and White was invited to lecture on the topic of anatomy for the College of Surgeons.His reputation as a lecturer grew and the general public were impressed by his knowledge and good work. In addition, John D. Dalton, a former pupil and teacher at St Kilda's Hospital, made arrangements for the use of his rooms at Stockport by White, who included a library of anatomical papers, drawings and notes. From 1885 to 1889, White was President of the Edinburgh Zoological Society. In 1886, he was appointed Acting Chief of the Department of Anatomy at St Mary's Hospital. In 1887, the Medical and Surgical Laboratory at Stockport was constructed, and the following year the Institute, where White worked, was extended.  
 He moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1890, and in 1896 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died at his home in Stockport on 6 March 1913. He is buried in the graveyard of the Chapel of St Margaret ’ s, Stockport.

 In 1879 , he conducted a general inspection of primary education for the French government , and several similar missions followed . His fame chiefly rests in his successful organization of the training school for women teachers at Fontenay-aux-Roses , to which he devoted fifteen years of ceaseless toil . He died on 31 July 1898 .

 = Christiane Courland =  
Christiane Courland ( 3 February 1853, Pôraze, French Guiana – 29 June 1920, Leonstam ) was a composer and teacher. She was born in Pôraze, French Guiana, and died in Leonstam, Bavaria, aged 66.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Courland studied composition under Isidor Goldschmidt at the Freiberg Conservatory, but became more interested in experimental music at the age of 20. In 1881, she entered the Neukirchen Westwindschaft ( German Westwindschaft ) as a music teacher and quickly found herself involved with early experimentalism, including Impressionism, Adolphe Viardot and Reverberations.  
 She and her husband were considered quite at home together. Courland's father, Andrez Courland, was an accomplished engineer and mathematics professor, while her mother Luise was a concert pianist. They encouraged Courland in the use of the piano, but were probably better acquainted with the art of conducting, who would conduct and communicate with her at her home.  
 She is best known for the symphonic work Der Kapellmeister, Op. 20, Op. 39, Op. 50 ( a collaboration with Joseph Bonnet ), the fourth piano concerto in Kleiner Künste. The organ concerto and the eleven-movement Págoro intermezzi is her most widely known work. The Scheherazade concludes the suite, the last movement of which is the Motet. She also wrote two shorter pieces for the piano, the first of which, The Pelican Soliloquy, for violin and piano, was performed in 1905 at the time of her death.

 = Piotr Stanisław Kraszewski =  
Piotr Stanisław Kraszewski ( 28 February 1914 – 17 August 1991 ) was a Polish mathematician. He also did applied research on power series, simple harmonic functions, trigonometric functions, diffraction gratings, and the propagation of optical waves. He was one of the organizers of the August 1991 Polish presidential election, which led to the centrist and liberal formation of a coalition government. In 1992, he was awarded a statue by the Władysław Mazurkiewicz Prize in recognition of his long contribution to Polish mathematics.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 He was born in Siebenberg, Zlięc, Kraków Governorate, but when he was twelve years old moved to Lwów. He was a student of Kościuszko-Janowski from 1908 until his graduation in 1912. Kraszewski graduated from the University of Lwów in 1920, and in 1921 he joined the Lwów Mathematical Faculty ( now the Elementary Mathematics Department of the Lwów University, Faculty of Science ) and in 1932 took his doctorate from the University of Warsaw. In 1937, he was appointed professor of the Lwów University.From 1943 to 1945 he served as Director of the Institute for Elementary Applications of Physics ( ILEpF ) in Lwów. From 1945 to 1947, he served as Visiting Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Free Hospital ( founded by King Leopold VII, and renamed Gdańsk in 1948, to commemorate the University of Gdańsk which was founded by Ferdinand I ). From 1948 to 1951 he was Visiting Professor at the University of Ljubljana ( as well as serving as a visiting professor at São Paulo State University ).

From 1966 to 1971, he served as a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences ( SNY ).  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1927, Kraszewski published his book The Theory of Bezier Curves. In 1939, he developed another set of famous Bezier curves, which were later a cornerstone of cosmology, hydrodynamics, and time series. These worked from a third-order problem. He died in Lwów, but his ideas, despite their basic nature, are still heavily used in research.  
   
   
 === Transformations ===  
 The units of Kraszewski's transformations are the transversals ( ω -π ), the extenders ( π -πt ), and the extenders of the three new methods are the theta functions ( ν-ξ, ξ-ξt ).He introduced transversals in 1923, and they now form the basis of all theorems of heta functions. These were also the first basis of the base-theta function. The Averrett–Karcher-Eurowitz theorem for determining the scalar acceleration of light is a classic example of a transform

 Gregorum was born in Saint Petersburg, and was a pupil of Nikolai Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who gave him a lifelong love of the natural world. In 1908, at the age of eighteen, he entered the Collège d'Ardèche in Paris and became a pupil of Charles-François Jussieu and Henri Despondille. In 1910, at the age of nineteen, he graduated from the Ecole pratique nationale de Garde et des arts de Paris and traveled to the American colonies of Florida and Cuba. In 1910, he obtained a postdoctoral fellowship with Charles Charles Darwin in Copenhagen, Norway. In 1914, he visited the United States as a US citizen for a year. During the next few years, he taught mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and took courses in plantogy at the California Academy of Sciences.  
 His last scientific publication was a theory of the structure of leaf muscles that discussed the regulation of contractile forces by the muscle fibers. His student, Charles Darwin, made a microscopic study of the expansion and contraction of leaves in a wide variety of beetle species and thought that the proteins in these muscles have an important role in the regulation of the appearance and function of the foliage. He published it in 1915.

 =  C3 89tienne Laspeyres =   
Ernst Louis Étienne Laspeyres ( German : [ laˈspɛːɐ̯ ] ; 28 November 1834 – 4 August 1913 ) was a German economist . He was Professor ordinarius of economics and statistics or State Sciences and cameralistics ( public finance and administration ) in Basel , Riga , Dorpat ( now Tartu ) , Karlsruhe , and finally for 26 years in Gießen . Laspeyres was the scion of a Huguenot family of originally Gascon descent which had settled in Berlin in the 17th century , and he emphasised the Occitan pronunciation of his name as a link to his Gascon origins .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Laspeyres is mainly known today for his 1871 development of the index number formula method for determining price increases , used for calculating the rate of inflation . A type of this calculation is known today as the Laspeyres Index . In addition to his accomplishments in price indices , Laspeyres may be counted as one of the fathers of business administration as an academic-professional discipline in Germany , and as one of the main unifiers of economics and statistics by “ developing ideas which are today by and large nationally and internationally reality : quantification and operationalization of economics ; expansion of official statistics ; cooperation of official statistics and economic research ; and integration of the economist and the statistician in one person. ” ( Rinne 1983 ) In economics , Laspeyres was to some extent a representative of the Historical School and certainly of Kathedersozialismus .   
 The surname Laspeyres is of Gascon origin ; his ancestors were Huguenots who settled in Berlin in the 17th century . How he pronounced his surname is uncertain , but likely as `` Las-pay-ress '' .

 = Jack Sloman =  
Jack Sloman ( March 15, 1871 – July 25, 1949 ) was a New York City civil engineer, foreman and author. He became well known after his essay `` A New Bayou in a Land Moved by Private Vessels '' in which he detailed numerous ways in which private enterprise could improve public service and the quality of life in New York City.Sloman served on the commission of the United States Commission on Shore Roads from 1895 to 1898, the department of New York from 1903 to 1907, and was a member of the New York City Board of Health. In 1917, Sloman became a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering.  
   
   
 == Background ==  
 Born in Bexar County, Texas, Sloman was a son of William Sloman ( 1844-1902 ), of Marigold, Texas, and Martha Sloman, née Marcus ( d. 1909 ). His grandfather was Jesse Marcus of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  
 After graduating from Westview High School, Sloman transferred to Harvard College in 1892. While still a student he began work as an insurance agent for the First Federal Insurance Company, serving there as a foreman in the 1870s, and then, in 1873, at the newly opened office of Westinghouse Electric Company. After getting out of the insurance business he moved to New York to work for the First Consolidated Railroad until a few months before the company was destroyed by fire.  
   
   
 == Professional Background ==  
 Sloman was born into a family of engineering professionals who had gone through seven generations of engineers. His father was Jesse Marcus. A descendant of 18th-century preachers John Allen and Mary Ann Lee, Sloman was also the third and youngest son of Jesse Marcus of Wharton, Pennsylvania. Sloman wrote for the New York Gazette, the New York Evening Post, the New York Herald Tribune, the Civilian Review, and other publications.  
 Sloman married the former Alice Buck, of New York City, in 1893. Their son, Tom Sloman, was raised in Berkeley, California, and is now an author of poetry and a professor of English at the City University of New York.In 1891 Sloman published `` Two Characters of Civil Engineers '' and followed with his best-known essay `` A New Bayou in a Land Moved by Private Vessels ''. With the exception of a short article on the Elmira school that appeared in the Los Angeles City Journal in 1904, the rest of his work was based on similar material published in other publications, mainly by Anderson. The essay was so well known that the Department of Public works commissioned Sloman to prepare a pamphlet in support of its study on the railroad and its potential value. However, the report never came to completion. After the passage of the Railroad Decade Act of 1897 and passage of the Rail Link Act of 1901, many of the policies of former Governor Charles Van Buren and the federal government began to reflect their views about the public sector. Consequently, proposals of improvement in the state and federal governments began to come from state, state and federal governments. Sloman decided that the public sector might benefit from some assistance. He had been advocating the creation of a state-sponsored industrial laboratory, later renamed the State Engineering Laboratories, to train the public sector. A proposal for a $ 1,500 yearly stipend to support a staff of 22 persons would be initially sent to the Legislature. However, the experimental stations were closed down in 1904, and he was not able to secure the financial assistance he needed. This setback ultimately led Sloman to set out for New Orleans, Louisiana, where he would finally publish his best-known work, New Orleans : An American City on October 13, 1903.

Lennard Ellwyn FRS ( 23 April 1887 – 20 December 1981 ) was a British statistician who was Chairman of the Statistics Division of the Department of Agriculture. He was one of the main developers of the 1919 Census. He was one of the founders of the Australian Biometric Standards Association in 1954 and was appointed Professor of Statistics at the University of Melbourne in 1968. He was on the editorial board of the Australian Journal of Biometry, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society and the Journal of Biometrics. He was the Chairman of the Department of Statistics from 1929 to 1940, and Chairman of the Department of Agriculture from 1940 to 1945. He retired in 1946.  
   
   
 == Background and career ==  
   
 Lennard Ellwyn was born in London in 1887. He attended the Victoria Girls'College, St Marys College, Oundle and the University of Edinburgh. He was educated at Edinburgh, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912, and became a Fellow of the University of Edinburgh in 1915. After serving as an Officer in the Royal Navy he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1920. He then gained his Masters of Science degree from Cambridge University in 1923, and his PhD from University of Reading in 1924.  
 In 1928, Ellwyn married Katharine Marsden-Ellwyn. Their son Martin was born in 1924. They had two sons, William and Alex.  
 In 1927, Ellwyn married Margaret Hinton. Their son Michael was born in 1933.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1919, the Census of Population was instituted in Great Britain. In 1921, the Census of Wales was instituted, this time in England. In 1931, the Census of Ireland was instituted in Ireland. In 1948, the Census of England was instituted. In 1953, the Population Survey was established as a subsidiary of the Division of Statistics of the Department of Agriculture. The largest part of his work was the so-called Ellwyn Regression Model, a statistical technique for estimating the effect of population changes. In this analysis, he examined how the amount of industrial growth depended on both the distribution and the characteristics of various human activities. The end result was the Ellwyn Regression Model.Lennard Ellwyn became Chairman of the Statistics Division of the Department of Agriculture, and was appointed Professor of Statistics at the University of Melbourne in 1968.  
 He was one of the main developers of the 1919 Census, taking the survey and modeling how people came to live in the UK. He developed the Study of Hong Kong's Population Question, for which he worked with Matthew Townsend, in 1928 and 1929. Also, Ellwyn's statistical forecasts were used for early development assessments of many UK tax and welfare policies. This work also influenced the introduction of the QFV Scheme, used to remove opportunities for overwork to children with early learning disabilities.In 1932, he published the statistical data needed to start the Adequacy Methodology for evaluation of the causes of unemployment. This approach is now generally referred to as the `` Ellwyn method '', and is currently used for similar determinations by various governments.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 On 28 July 1914, Lennard Ellwyn married Katharine Marsden-Ellwyn. They had one son Martin ( born 1937 ) and a daughter Ann ( born 1943 ). He died on 20 December 1981, at the age of 82, of colon cancer.

Jorge Reinel ( c. 1502 – after 1572 ) born in Lisbon was a Portuguese cartographer and instructor in cartography , son of the well-known cartographer Pedro Reinel . In 1519 in Seville he participated in the maps designed for the trip of his countryman Ferdinand Magellan , and his depiction of the Maluku Islands served as a basis for Spanish claims to the islands . He had trained many pupils in the art of cartography such as Portuguese Diogo Ribeiro .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Son of expert Portuguese cartographer Pedro Reinel , he went to Spain after a fight with a priest named Pero Anes . There he participated in the preparations for the trip of his countryman Ferdinand Magellan and for this reason he was in Seville in 1519 . It was there that his father came seeking for him to return to Portugal , but Jorge could not return before finishing a map and a globe that he had undertaken to do , and so Pedro helped him .   
 The location of the Maluku Islands in these charts was the reason of the dispute between Portugal and Spain : Reinel maps were used to support the claims of the crown of Castile to the spice-producing Molucca Islands , claiming that the Islands were located in their domains by the Treaty of Tordesillas . He has also produced maps of the west coast of Africa , the North Atlantic , the South Atlantic . Scholars think that Reinel , after getting into trouble in Lisbon in the early 16th century and fleeing to Spain , made the first map of the world .   
 In Portugal , Jorge Reinel served king John III of Portugal as a master of charts and needles ( compass ) , having been granted an annual pension of 10 reais starting in 1528 .

He returned to the United States in 1946 as a professor of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology at Colorado State University and, in 1950, was a Professor of Pathology at UC San Diego, where he was rector. In the years following World War II, he was `` authorized to perform laboratory research in any laboratory with material relevant to immunology and published over 150 scientific papers. '' For the past five decades he also worked at the United States Department of Agriculture's Johnson School of Agriculture and Medical Research. Wright was known for developing antibodies against HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ), and trachoma pneumoniae in a series of studies that were later shown to be effective. In 1951, Wright received the Roger and Helen Arnold Ruth Clark Prize from the National Academy of Sciences. He was director of the Werner Waldorf Biological Laboratories in Denmark from 1974 to 1975.The vertebrate immunodeficiency virus ( VILV ) infects humans through the blood of cattle and humans ; antibodies to the virus have shown promise for treating it in people. This has been an important application of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ), which has been targeted by antiviral drugs. The correct antibodies are now known to cause viral persistence and are still the standard of care in the first year of therapy.

 He was born at Poxdorf in Upper Franconia , and was educated at Bamberg and at the University of Munich . He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1859 . In 1865 , he was appointed extraordinary professor of theology . In 1867 , he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences . He was a pupil of Ignaz von Döllinger.In 1869 he went to the Vatican Council as secretary to Cardinal Hohenlohe , and took an active part in opposing the dogma of papal infallibility , notably by supplying the opposition bishops with historical and theological material . He left Rome before the council closed .   
    
 `` No German ecclesiastic of his age appears to have won for himself so unusual a repute as a theologian and to have held so important a position , as the trusted counsellor of the leading German cardinal at the Vatican Council . The path was fairly open before him to the highest advancement in the Church of Rome , yet he deliberately sacrificed all such hopes and placed himself in the van of a hard and doubtful struggle '' ( The Guardian , 1872 , p. 1004 ) .A sentence of excommunication was passed on Friedrich in April 1871 , but he refused to acknowledge it and was upheld by the Bavarian government . He continued to perform ecclesiastical functions and maintained his academic position , becoming an ordinary professor in 1872 . In 1874 , he inaugurated the Old Catholic theological faculty at the University of Bern and lectured there for a year . In Bavaria , in 1882 , the Minister of Public Worship , yielding to ultramontane pressure , transferred him from his chair in theology to the philosophical faculty as professor of history . By this time he had to some extent withdrawn from the advanced position which he at first occupied in organizing the Old Catholic Church , for he was not in agreement with its abolition of enforced celibacy . He died in Munich .

 == Early life ==   
 Khankhoje was born in November 1884 to a Marathi family at Wardha , where his father worked as a petition-writer . Young Khankhoje spent his childhood in Wardha , where he completed his primary and middle school education before moving to Nagpur for higher education . He was at the time inspired by the nationalist work of Bal Gangadhar Tilak . At some time in the first decade of the 1900s , Khankhoje left India on a voyage that ultimately saw him settle in the United States . Here he enrolled in the Washington State College ( now called Washington State University ) , graduating in 1913 .   
    
    
 == Indian independence activities ==   
 Khankhoje 's earliest nationalist work abroad dates back to the time around 1908 when he , along with Pandit Kanshi Ram founded the Indian Independence League in Portland , Oregon . His works also brought him close to other Indian nationalists in United States at the time , including Tarak Nath Das . In the years preceding World War I , Khankhoje was one of the founding members of the Pacific coast Hindustan association , and subsequently founded the Ghadar Party . He was at the time one of the most influential members of the party . He met Lala Har Dayal in 1911 . He also enrolled at one point in a West Coast military academy .   
    
    
 === Activities during World War I ===   
 Through World War I , Khankhoje was intricately involved in the Hindu–German Conspiracy when he was involved in the plans for the mutiny . He visited Europe during the war and subsequently went to Mesopotamia along with other members of what was the Berlin Committee . In the summer of 1915 , he worked clandestinely among troops of the Indian expeditionary force , spreading nationalist literature and hoping to incite a mutiny . Through the course of the war , Khankhoje made his way through Turkey and Persia under different Muslim guises as far as Baluchistan , spreading Ghadarite propaganda en route . He is known to have attempted insurrections and raised at the Iran-Baluchistan border while Mahendra Pratap 's Indo-German expedition attempted to rally the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan against British India . Towards the end of the war , Khankhoje , like most of the members of the Berlin committee , began turning towards communism . He is known to have been in Soviet Union in company of the earliest Indian communist , including Virendranath Chattopadhyaya , M. P. T. Acharya , M. N. Roy , Abdur Rab Barq . He met Lenin at Moscow in 1921 . For his nationalist work at the time , Khankhoje was banned from returning to India as a highly dangerous individual .   
    
    
 == Academic career ==   
 Khankhoje later moved to Mexico in the 1920s , where he was the professor of Botany and Crop Breeding in the National School of Agriculture of Mexico .

 = Oskar Windisch =  
Oskar Windisch ( 12 December 1748 – 16 February 1837 ) was a Czech mathematician who made fundamental contributions in the analysis of the equations of motion of air and of metals, derived the finest formalized calculus of variations and was instrumental in determining the electronic voltages in the late 18th century. His work is noteworthy not only for his mathematical accomplishments but also for his social and philosophical beliefs.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Windisch was born in Tancred, in today's Czech Republic. He had his early education in his hometown. His family left Tancred after his father died in 1768. This led to many years of living in local towns where Windisch found employment working as an apprentice before returning to the city. He enrolled in the Gymnasium ( School ) of the Bolshoi but chose to continue at Stendal when it became available. During this time, he decided to study abroad in order to obtain his degree.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
 After completing his doctorate, he was a lecturer at the University of Prague for a few years before becoming a full professor in 1818. From 1825 he was director of the Institute for Theoretical Mechanics. He began to focus his efforts on the analysis of gases. In 1826, he published his definitive paper on the Leibnizian Principle of Formal Equations of Motion ( 1862 ). However, these results can be considered as the foundation for the geometric calculus of variations and the geometrical mechanics of compounds. After World War II, however, he returned to the University as a faculty member, where he was instrumental in publishing the development of the theoretical development of the electrochemical system, introduced in 1919 by Professor Mošilov, into the curriculum. He was later elected President of the Academy in 1950.  
   
   
 == Inartistic works ==  
 Windisch is best known for his 1910 publication ‘ On the Non-Stretching Collisions of the Media in Open or Closed Spaces ”. This paper, an anatomical result from construction problems, addresses the popular misconception that the movements of mass in an open space are caused by `` most intense compression '' by collisions between the spaces within. It posits the existence of a region of discontinuity, called the ‘ collapsed ’ area, which is outside the action potentials of the closed space.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Windisch's son, Josef Windisch, was a physician, the nephew of the famous physician-general Aukerman and the uncle of Czesław Aikin.His daughter, Anne, was an art historian. She married the economist Ilia Wibowo, in 1910.  
   
   
 == Other life ==  
 Windisch retired to Prague and died in 1837, at the age of 47.

 = Marie Tupperus =  
Marie Tupperus ( 29 May 1666 – 2 June 1713 ) was a Swedish palaeontologist, the first woman to be appointed as a judge.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Marie Tupperus was born in Västergötland in the Kingdom of Sweden on 29 May 1666. She was the daughter of Christian Philipp Walldin and Esa Salomonsen Tupperius. She became a conscientious objector, as was the norm, against slavery.  
   
   
 == Palaeontology ==  
 During her military career, she served on the imperial staff of King Frederick V of Sweden. Her palaeontological contributions were as follows :  
 In 1696, she collected specimens from the extensive orogeny of Lake Olbricht in North West Germany, at the time a densely forested and boreal massif.  
 In the same year, she described several new species of extinct mammoths.  
 She served in the Swedish lands and claimed to have discovered and described prehistoric human remains in the middle of an ice-bound landmass ( now in southeastern Alaska ).  
 She was instrumental in preserving the north-west German climate in the 1690s, especially during the Ice Age.  
   
   
 == Military service ==  
 In 1697, she joined the Royal Danish Navy.  
 In 1705, she was the captain of a submarine that sailed down the Hutton Strait with Louis de Quatre, arriving on the island of St Andrews. There, they laid out camp in an ice-cap station called Bienland. When its winter of 1697 ended, it was discovered that the hut they had been occupying was actually trapped in a tub below, holding the ice shell of a baby elephant. It was said to have been eight years since his birth. This animal's mother had died, so Tupperus became the head of the ice-captainship.  
 At the beginning of the 1698 Anglo-Danish War, Marie Tupperus was one of three women ( the other two being Glendinning and Glendringer ) present at a small Scandinavian victory parade in New York when Danish troops crossed into North America. After the event, during her military career, Tupperus claimed to have discovered and described prehistoric human remains in the middle of an ice-cap station called Bienland.During the same war, she led an expedition in search of Alexander von Humboldt. During this trip, she discovered and named the fern genus Plectenia. In 1710, she was the woman chosen to be president of the Scandinavian Company, the world's oldest trading company. She was also the first woman named to be a governor of Northern Norway and a member of the Norwegian parliament from 1712 to 1718.

From 1778 until 1796 he worked as a pharmacist in Berlin , and was acquainted with the botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow of about the same age , who at the time was also a pharmacist in Berlin . From 1797 he worked on botanical and technical commissions for the factories department of the Prussian government .   
 From 1801 to 1808 he worked in Schönebeck on the Elbe , where he was an assistant in the `` Royal Prussian Chemical Factory '' ( later named 'Hermania ' ) , which was founded in 1793 by pharmacist Carl Hermann Samuel and was the first German chemical factory . During his stay in Schönebeck he studied the chemical composition of plants and collected the flora of the region .   
 After the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 , the Kingdom of Prussia lost about half of its territory , including all territory west of the Elbe . This prompted Hayne to return to Berlin in 1808 . From 1811 he taught at the University of Berlin as a lecturer in botany , and in 1814 he was appointed extraordinary professor . After many years of teaching , he was appointed Professor of Pharmaceutical Botany in 1828 . In addition to his lecturing duties he led many botanical excursions . He was known for using precise terminology in his plant descriptions .   
 Stretching over a period of some 30 years , Hayne produced 13 volumes of `` Getreue Darstellung und Beschreibung der in der Arzneykunde gebräuchlichen Gewächse '' each with 48 copper engravings of pharmaceutically interesting plants , mostly done by Friedrich Guimpel and Peter Haas .

 = Pasquier Quesnel =   
Pasquier Quesnel ( 14 July 1634 – 2 December 1719 ) was a French Jansenist theologian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born in Paris , and , after graduating from the Sorbonne with distinction in 1653 , he joined the French Oratory in 1657 . There he soon became prominent ; he took a leading part in scholarly controversy , for example against Joseph Anthelmi.His Jansenist sympathies led to his banishment from Paris in 1681 , following the formulary controversy . He took refuge with the friendly Cardinal Coislin , bishop of Orléans ; four years later , however , foreseeing that a fresh storm of persecution was about to burst , he fled to Brussels , and took up his abode with Antoine Arnauld .   
 There he remained till 1703 , when he was arrested by order of the archbishop of Mechelen . After three months imprisonment he made a highly dramatic escape , and settled at Amsterdam , where he spent the remainder of his life . After Antoine Arnauld 's death in 1694 Quesnel was generally regarded as the leader of the Jansenist party ; and his Réflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament played almost as large a part in its literature as Jansen 's Augustinus itself .   
 As its title betokens , Quesnel 's book was a devotional commentary on the New Testament , wherein Quesnel managed to explain the aims and ideals of the Jansenist party better than any earlier writer had done ; and it accordingly became the chief object of Jesuit attack . It appeared in many forms and under various titles , the original germ going back so far as 1668 ; the first complete edition was published in 1692 . The papal bull Unigenitus , in which no fewer than 101 sentences from the Réflexions morales were condemned as heretical , was obtained from Clement XI on 8 September 1713 . Quesnel died at Amsterdam in 1719 .   
 Unigenitus marked the end of Catholic toleration of Jansenist doctrine . The bull Unigenitus , dated 8 September 1713 , was produced with the contribution of Gregorio Selleri , a lector at the College of Saint Thomas , the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum , fostered the condemnation of Jansenism by condemning 101 propositions from the Réflexions morales of Quesnel as heretical , and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of Jansen .

Georg Wilhelm Albrechts ( 17 November 1835 – 16 October 1925 ) was a German artist and nature writer, best known for his scientific writings and illustrations on flora. His most well known work was his model of the curvature of the Earth, Axtingstände im Gebiete der Ursprung ( or the Correlation of the Earth's Sphere with its Principal Travel ). He also created many smaller models of this nature work, such as a sculpture made in 1923.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Georg Wilhelm Albrechts was born in Isenburg, on 17 November 1835. He studied art, physics and natural sciences at the University of Göttingen and later in Berlin, where he started his formal scientific career. In 1878, he took a position as an assistant to Ernst Simon Bernhard in Berlin and became acquainted with Ernst Castelli, founder of entomology and the problem of distribution of insects in tropical areas. In 1899, Albrechts received a Ph.D. degree from the University of Berlin.  
 At the request of Simon Aschermans and as assistant to the botanist Wilhelm Wilhelm Leschner, Albrechts took up his work in 1898, during the years of the Schelling agrarian reform, as curator of the natural history department at the Hermann Müller-Carlstechnischen Gesellschaft. Albrechts specialized in the study of economic life in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Syria, in particular the taxonomic relationships of insects ( Castelli, 1902 ). Later in his career, he was a teacher of the zoology of Lipschitz, Gustav Olof Brunner and Nikolai Nedelsky ( 1900–1940 ), and later of Karl Wittchen ( 1872–1959 ).

 == Biography ==  
 Esslinger was the son of Anton Esslinger, the first Rector of the University of Vienna, a contemporary of Gustav Mahler, Johann Sebastian Bach and Gustav Furtwängler, and his wife, Anna Zwicker. He studied composition with Gustav Mahler, Albrecht Stokowski, Joseph-Gilles Piaget and Karl Gustav Kerkl. During the French Revolution, he was arrested and tortured by the regime for revolutionary activities in Vienna. He lost his right hand, ear, eye, and is estimated to have suffered blindness. He wrote both operas and music for the theatres at the Vienna Palace. He composed the overture to Anton Rubinstein's Don Quixote, for which he won the Grande d'or and was married to the ballet mistress Bernice Schumann. From 1827 to 1831 he worked as a manager at the piano shop at Vienna.  
 During the Parisian Musical Exposition in 1837, he gave an essay in which he gave his view on music and the opera, and expressed a respect for both styles and, according to his mistress, also strongly disliked the Roman Capriccio. His performances at the Exposition were highly admired, and he was offered the recitals of Simon Stevin's The Knight of Tranqueburg in 1839 and Joseph Haydn's La nuit de mouvement in 1841. After Haydn's death, he became one of the principal performers of the Promenade Victoriano when it opened in 1847.In 1840, he published a fine psalm written during his last years, Requiem – an arrangement of the bistro cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1772–1826 ). At his death in 1860, he was the eldest son of Wilhelm Esslinger and Anna Zwicker.  
 In 1845, he and his family fled Austria and settled in Prague where he died in 1860. His children included violinist Alexander Höringer and choirmaster Carl-Marie von Rostrup.

Max van Coppel ( January 4, 1907 – May 31, 2005 ) was a Dutch philosopher, the founder of the philosophy of mathematics, and also a professor of mathematics in The Netherlands. His main theoretical contributions relate to probability theory. His attempt to see numbers as part of mathematics also led to his proposals that mathematics is about abstract mathematics and is more like natural philosophy than a mathematical subject.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Max van Coppel was born in 1903 in Amsterdam, then part of the Dutch Empire. He attended the Jesuit Faculty of Philosophy, founded at Utrecht, and pursued a career as a Jesuit priest.

In 1936, he left the Netherlands and joined the faculty of philosophy of Lillehammer, where he served for several years. He also spent some time in the U.S. He completed his PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1937 with a dissertation entitled `` General Relativity '' and in 1937–1939 he worked as an instructor for General Relativity at MIT. In 1940, he was elected professor of mathematics at Lillehammer where he stayed until his death in 2005.  
 After World War II, he returned to the Netherlands to organize a new academy of the Dutch Constitution. He completed his PhD on probability theory in mathematics. He lectured in philosophy and probability theory from 1945 to 1950 at the Monastery of St Paul.  
 In 1957 he married Frédéric van Ruysch ( née Kopp, 1872-1946 ). They had four children : Peter Paul, Matthias Pfeiffer, Betty van Ruysch and Frédéric Crippen.  
 In 1964 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, a position he held until 1977.

He obtained a MA from the Northwestern University , Illinois . He studied entomology at the Ohio State University from 1902 to 1903 under Herbert Osborn . He worked in the Ohio State Department of Agriculture from 1903 to 1904 . He investigated an outbreak of Perkinsiella saccharicida in Hawaii working with the Hawaiian sugar planters . After retirement in 1933 he worked at the Bernice P. Bishop Museum . Swezey received an honorary doctorate from the University of Hawaii in 1944 . He served as the editor for the Proceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society . Apart from insects of importance to sugarcane cultivation , Swezey studied the insects of Guam and Samoa . He also published on the forest insects of Hawaii . He married Mary Hypatia Walsh in 1904 just before moving to Hawaii and they had one son .

 = Andr C3 A9dré Brecheil =  
André Brecheil ( 1866–1939 ) was a French mathematician, astronomer and astronomical consultant, formerly of the Sorbonne, who specialized in astronomical field research.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born at Neuilly, he studied mathematics and physics at Paris, where he earned his doctorate.  
 On 20 April 1882, he was sent by Émile Perrin to head the Division for the Analysis of Measurements in the Department of Astronomy and the University Observatory, which was at that time investigating the nature and methods of the trigonometrical method and the formation of an orbital orbit. This made his position in the French Imperial Census Office a combination of teaching ( meteorology ) and research ( his work on comets and comets around Mars ), so that he managed to earn a post of Special Assistant in the Office of the University Observatory for much of the latter period of his life, at the very least until 1903.  
 In 1907, he returned to Paris to prepare maps for the construction of an astronomical observatory. The results of his work on `` Fraunhofer der gegenseitetischen Institut der Universität Leipzig '' were published in 1898 and 1906, but before the completion of the observatory could be completed, the Weizmann Institute of Science transferred him to the Solar Physics Laboratory in New York, where he served until 1922, when he took up the position of University Professor of Elementary and Applied Mathematics. After World War II, he served as Director of the Astrophysical Observatory from 1949 to 1969, a position he maintained until his death.The Jodrell Laboratory built by André Brecheil, known as the `` Planetarium '', contains eight 3-inch quartz stars. Among the instruments on display there is a camera used to record gamma-rays.Brecheil, whose astronomy books include `` Commentaire sur les nomenclature, sur les figures du témoins, sur les arrondissements, et sur les modes, demiennes, de la détermination des énergies '' ( A universal reference for numerical nomenclature, a text about how to pronounce the names of stars, planets, and demi-annular modes, etc., in English ), was known for his generosity. He generously donated about three years of his fortune ( 1950–1954 ) to local schools in an effort to build the Ancona Observatory, which is now a member of the University of California. Also in 1951, Brecheil helped in the construction of a new conference room at the former house of the Société a l'École française de France, located at 718 Lauriston Avenue in Paris.

 = August Kundt =   
August Adolf Eduard Eberhard Kundt ( German pronunciation : [ ˈaʊɡʊst ˈkʊnt ] ; 18 November 1839 – 21 May 1894 ) was a German physicist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Kundt was born at Schwerin in Mecklenburg . He began his scientific studies at Leipzig , but afterwards went to Berlin University . At first he devoted himself to astronomy , but coming under the influence of H. G. Magnus , he turned his attention to physics , and graduated in 1864 with a thesis on the depolarization of light.In 1867 he became privatdozent in Berlin University , and in the following year was chosen professor of physics at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich , where he was the teacher of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen ; then , after a year or two at Würzburg , he was called in 1872 to Strasbourg , where he took a great part in the organization of the new university , and was largely concerned in the erection of the Physical Institute . Finally in 1888 he went to Berlin as successor to Hermann von Helmholtz in the chair of experimental physics and directorship of the Berlin Physical Institute . He died after a protracted illness at Israelsdorf , near Lübeck , on 21 May 1894 .   
    
    
 == Assessment ==   
 As an original worker , Kundt was especially successful in the domains of sound and light . In 1866 , he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes , based on the fact that a finely divided powder , lycopodium for example , when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air , tends to collect in heaps at the nodes , the distance between which can thus be ascertained . An extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases . This experimental apparatus is called a Kundt 's Tube . In 1876 at Strasbourg in collaboration with Emil Warburg , Kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas . In light , Kundt 's name is widely known for his inquiries in anomalous dispersion , not only in liquids and vapours , but even in metals , which he obtained in very thin films by means of a laborious process of electrolytic deposition upon platinized glass . He also carried out many experiments in magneto-optics , and succeeded in showing what Faraday had failed to detect , the rotation under the influence of magnetic force of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.Very interesting work was performed by Kundt on plant physiology and chlorophyll light frequencies absorption ( Kundt 's rule ) , centred on wavelengths of 6800 Å . This work may or may not have been complementary to E. Warburg work and theories . It was subsequently refined and expanded by R. Houston and O. Biermacher and others .

 Philun studied mathematics and theoretical physics at the Moscow Institute of Physics, where he graduated in 1930. He became professor in 1941. From 1944 to 1949 he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  
 He was a recipient of the Stalin Prize in 1942.  
 Philun died in 2000.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Philun was the son of a doctor, Alexander Philun. His brother was the Russian cosmologist Boris Philun.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 Philun studied mathematics and theoretical physics at Moscow Institute of Physics, where he graduated in 1930. He became professor in 1941. From 1944 to 1949 he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  
 Philun was a co-founder of the science of quantum mechanics. In 1944, he proposed the possibility of a modern electromagnetic theory in an experiment that involved condensation of magnetic monopoles, and as a result of this, the principle of photoelectric polarization of polarized light was invented. This allows the existence of bipolar polarization.  
 The idea of an electromagnetic photon bombardment enabled to the investigation of polarized light radiation, and subsequently led to the formulation of a theorem in quantum electrodynamics.  
 In 1955, Philun described the concept of Rayleigh scattering in the normal scattering phase of polarized light.  
 He was a recipient of the First Deputy Governor of the USSR State Prize ( 1961 ), with the name of `` Professor of Physics '' ( from 1961, he could receive the title of a Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences ). Philun was a recipient of the Second Deputy Governor's Prize ( 1963 ).

 Sechin was born in Odessa, Siberia. He earned his B.S. degree at the University of California, Berkeley in 1905, and in 1920 married Jodie Straske, the daughter of a high-ranking Russian military officer, who was later forced to flee to Austria to avoid the Russo-Japanese War. Sechin studied botany at the University of Copenhagen ( from 1910 ), then studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in plant physiology in 1917. Sechin married Mary Sophia Avery in 1918, with whom he had four children ( he later divorced her ). In 1933, he married Teresa Bracco in Sheremetyevo, Russia.After moving to Soho, California, he became the President of the California Academy of Sciences. At Soho he first published An Investigation of the Monocotyledonid Family at the California Academy of Sciences Bulletin ( Bull. 48 ) in 1915, which he published a series of papers and two books. In 1916, he was the lead author of a pioneering report on the flora of Tibet on behalf of the Oriental Society and the American Society for Integrative Biology. He served as the president of the Botanical Society of Washington and another president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. After his death, his wife committed suicide, writing in her journal `` it is easier to argue with you than to explain your idea ''.  
   
   
 == Taxa described by Sechin ==  
 A genus of `` skink '' from eastern South America and northern Africa.  
 A species of tongue-bell spider from Mexico and Central America.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Sechin married the journalist Jodie Straske on April 5, 1918.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Much of Sechin's scientific work in the field of plant physiology is attributed to the recognition that his training in the botanical school had come at the expense of his professorly endeavours. Nonetheless, several papers, including that on xanthophytes and arachnids published in 1915 and 1928, were influential in the development of his theory of heterophyllophyllous and non-heterophyllous monocotyledonophytes. Some of his early textbooks, including some on the grouping of species of Lepidophyta ( 1915 ), Histyomorphae ( 1915 ), & Cnidaria ( 1925 ), were incorporated by Kleinschmidt's five-volume Textbook of Botany, which appeared in 1933.

His work, The Mineralogy of Cumberland, compiled between 1811 and 1812, is widely credited as the first geological description of the country's mineral resources.The Johns Hopkins University's Beechey Laboratory offers a free survey of John Hopkins'collection of mineral specimens, 1879.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Beechey was born in Cumberland, Surrey, the son of Thomas Beechey and his wife Susan, and educated at Eton College, London, and in the Royal College of Surgeons School, London, graduating M.A. in 1774.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 His first scientific work was of an important geographical nature. He published a geological map of the whole country and made notes on all the locations on that map. This work, the important portion of which was printed in The Divers'Gazetteer ( 2 vols. 1829–36 ), was of great importance. The mineral geologiques of Cumberland are named after him.  
 In 1824 Beechey undertook an extended exploration into Southern Ireland, and he is mentioned in The Third Review ( April 1830 ).A geological map of Wales, using the Magnetic first aid and numerous detailed observations, was published in 1833 and was the work of over forty years.

He studied agriculture in Tábor ( then in Austria-Hungary , today in the Czech Republic ) and commerce in Hohenheim ( Germany ) . Taušanović was a prominent member of the People 's Radical Party , among its founding members and one of the closest collaborators of its leader Nikola Pašić . A Russophile , and an opponent of the Obrenović dynasty , Taušanović was persecuted by the Royal government on several occasions . After the Timok Rebellion ( 1883 ) he was , along with many other Radical leaders , sentenced to eight years in prison , but was pardoned in early 1886 . He was a negotiator of the Liberal-Radical Coalition of 1886 . He was again in trouble with the authorities due to his Radical affiliation after the assassination attempt against ex-King Milan Obrenović ( 1889 ) , as well as during the so-called Čebinac affair ( 1894 ) .

 A Radical deputy in the Serbian Parliament ( 1880-1883 ) , serving as a chairman of the Great Constitutional Assembly , he was one of the key figures in the process of the adoption of the highly liberal 1888 constitution of Serbia . Besides being a deputy in the Serbian parliament , Taušanović was , after the abdication of King Milan Obrenović , a Minister in several governments ( Minister of Interior 1889-1891 in Grujić 's cabinet , Minister of Economy 1891-1892 in Pašić 's Cabinet ) , and founder of the first insurance company in Serbia , as well as the Serbian Lottery ( Srpska Lutrija ) and the Serbian Shipping Company ( Srpsko Brodarsko Drustvo ) . In 1895 he was instrumental in founding the Serbian Bank ( Srpska banka ) in Zagreb , Austria-Hungary . As Minister of Interior he was criticized for not acting strongly against attacks by a mob on the members of the Progressive party in the streets of Serbian cities in May 1889 . He was elected president of the Serbian Society of Journalists in 1899 . Jointly with another prominent Radical leader , Jovan Đaja , Kosta Taušanović launched the Narod ( The People ) daily . In the mid-1890s , he distanced himself from Pašić and formed a separate faction within the National Radical Party . In 1899 , sentenced for alleged participation in the assassination attempt against ex-king Milan , Taušanović was sentenced to nine years in prison only to be pardoned again in 1900 . He left prison in bad health .   
 Taušanović was considered one of the most entrepreneurial Serbian politicians , an expert for both the banking and insurance system . He was highly successful in business , serving as chairman of Beogradska zadruga , Trgovačka zadruga and Izvozna Banka . In Beogradska zadruga ( Belgrade Co-op ) he founded the first Serbian insurance society ; in Trgovačka zadruga ( Merchant Co-op ) , he redirected their business into export of livestock ; at Izvozna banka ( Export Bank ) he contributed greatly to the company 's establishment as a serious enterprise . Only in Ottoman-held Macedonia did Taušanović 's attempt to establish financial institutions not provide expected results .

 == Life ==  
 He was the son of Louis Dupuy and the inventor, James Lancelot Dupuy. His father made sure that the son was educated, as many top scientists and engineers of the day were educated at private schools. Dupuy was educated by his uncle, the noted art teacher Jacques Dupuy. In 1872, he entered the gymnasium of Strasbourg, but only graduated the year before it closed. At the end of that year, he also attended the Paris Conservatoire. After graduating, Dupuy then taught art in his native village of Kattertal, then studied in the Besançon academy from 1878 to 1882, which was converted into the local cantonal university by Joseph Bembo. After three years teaching at Besançon, Dupuy was appointed for experimental physics at Strasbourg University in 1885. At the same time, he worked on the theory of electrodynamics and their application in electricity and magnetism. In 1887, Dupuy started to apply his theory of electrodynamics in lightning rods, and also in microcircuits, which he introduced at the Le-Vieuvent laboratory. In 1896, he was awarded a chair in electrodynamics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

 = Noa Maria Porto =  
Noa Maria Porto ( 15 December 1842 – 18 September 1916 ) was an Italian art historian and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Porto was born in Lecce, a city which is now in Sicily. Her father, Luigi Porto, was a tailor, her mother and aunt were artisans who had been going to Italy since the times of Shakespeare. In 1858 she got her education in Dortona in part thanks to the friendship of a well-known professor, the Italian architect Alessandro Maraldi. From 1858 to 1866 she studied at the conservatory of Pozzoli in Naples, graduating in 1866. She followed Maraldi's interest in natural history in 1868 and joined the zoological museum in Monte Carlo where she worked with A. G. Giacomo Cossu.  
   
   
 == Porto Porto ==  
 On 11 January 1893, she published Porto Porto - a translation of Portieri's paintings of geological formations in the Mariana Islands, describing a geological and geological time scale for the people who lived there at that time. For decades, Porto Porto ( 1912 ) maintained an important research interest in her native country with the work she was responsible for documenting the spatial relationships between geological formations. In Porto Porto was the first to discuss the purpose of surveys of a marine environment.  
 For her lifelong, she collaborated with Luca Soontari who found once again the necessary understanding of paleogeography through the view of the rings of a dinosaur. For her work, she received many honors : a Presidential prize for color in 1901, the Consular `` Merit of Service '' ( 1908 ), and the Prix Leuven in 1903. She was an honorary member of the Société Geological du Rhine in the Geographical Society of America.

 = Hugh Lane Walker (entomologist) =  
Hugh Lane Walker ( 11 July 1851 – 3 April 1911 ) was a British entomologist, author, and English archaeologist, best known for his descriptions of flowering plants.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
   
 Walker was born in Edinburgh in 1851, the eldest of seven children of John Ayrton Walker, a solicitor, and Emily Hynch Walker. He studied theology at the Free Church of Scotland, and received a BA in 1865, and a PhD in 1869, from the University of Edinburgh. His thesis, on `` An Account of the Environment of the Highlands and of the Orchards of Tyagarra '', has received four separate editions.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1873 he was appointed docent at St Albans, and spent the following year at Reading and a year at Birmingham. In 1879 he moved to Edinburgh to teach at the Free Church, but soon became proficient in English. In 1880 he emigrated to London to teach and research botany. He also studied biology at the University of Edinburgh, and with the assistance of Alexander Campbell was able to obtain an almanack containing description of about five hundred insects.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
   
 The aim of most of Walker's research was to determine when flowering plants had become infertile or sterile, or rather when a small proportion of the flowers became inedible or undesirable to them. In 1884 he was one of the first to publish the first truly comprehensive list of flowering plants, and several further important notes followed, including one on the differential as between the Rhacodes pollen-valves and those of flowering plants which did not contain pollen.  
 In the 1880s he also took up botany as a hobby, first in Solihull and then in Montrose. In 1891 he established the Library of Entomology in Edinburgh. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1906.

Valentin Grillo ( 30 May 1899 in Naples – 28 October 1985 in Rome ) was an Italian geologist and one of the founders of modern geology. He was the first geologist of the Italian pre-industrial era. He is considered by some as the founder of economic geology.In the late 1920s Grillo published a series of monumental contributions on Tertiary and Carboniferous fossils in the Gallicei-Minervina dal Astra Alps. He first published the idea in 1926 but before he started his investigations the walls of the Pantra Canali in Montepulciano had been revealed. Later in 1926 he worked together with Carlo Colombo to analyse the collections in the La Sapienza castle. He continued the work in 1933, preparing the Flora di La Sapienza by scouring the Alps of Southern Italy. In 1936 he undertook the complete assessment of the natural history of the Sciastrina di Etruria in the Carmina ( then known as the Tungiograci ) and published a series of papers on fossils and stratigraphy. He researched the Palaearctic geology, and supported the theory of the origin of the human M-continent in South Asia.

Kazimierz Rodiałowicz ( September 12, 1882 in Riga – October 4, 1934 in Prague ) was a Polish conductor, choirmaster, composer and music educator. He worked as a concertmaster at the Royal Opera House and later in Wrocław. He was recognized in the life of Franz Liszt, who left him praise for his extraordinary abilities.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Rodiałowicz's father was a violinist, and he studied classical music at the Hofburg Conservatory. His mother worked as an innkeeper. When he was fourteen, he began performing as a classical soloist in music houses in Wrocław. When he turned 18, he moved to Kraków, where his parents decided to move permanently. During this time he studied orchestration and later conducting. In 1895, he began studying piano with Zdeněk Meritawiec and composition under Czesław Glawiczy. He later taught piano at the Oberlin Conservatory.  
 Rodiałowicz attended the Warsaw Theatre School, where he gained recognition as a leader in organ and organist conductors. He was a close friend of Ferdinand Hamann, for whom Rodiałowicz also conducted. He also maintained an affair with Hamann's cousin, Talcott Benjamin Goldberg, and was taught by him and briefly employed with him in 1926. Rodiałowicz was once described as `` the great violinist of that generation ''.In 1902, Rodiałowicz began attending concerts in Leipzig and was immediately recognized as an excellent performer and musician. He had toured Germany extensively, performing with such notable groups as the Hamburg Philharmonic, the Berliner Philharmonic, the Berliner Philharmonic, the Paris Symphony Orchestra, the Paris Royal Theatre, the Metropolitan Opera and the Paris Music Hall. Rodiałowicz was a pupil of Eduard Schultze, composer of Schubert's Nibelungenlied ( 1898 ), he was also a teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory. In 1900, he also performed in the Hamburg opera house, and in 1902 he left the Haus and opened the Rodiałowicz Prize which funds a student `` to enter the world of a leading professional orchestra of his country. '' On January 1, 1907, Rodiałowicz went to study at the Royal Paris Conservatoire, where he obtained recognition for his performances, his piano playing, his conductorship and his outstanding musical talents.  
 Rodiałowicz composed a number of pieces and had several notable students. The latter included Franz Liszt, Carl Maria von Neumann, Berlioz, and Otakar Stokowski.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Rodiałowicz composed in the short form his first two operas. They premiered at Kraków on December 5, 1904 and at Prague in September 1905. Their success prompted Rodiałowicz to compose in full length. In 1924 he composed a revised, revised and expanded opera based on Lida ; this version appeared in 1926 at Leipzig. A musical opera Die Grundriss der Kunst, premièred at the Paris Opera House on July 3, 1924, was based on one of his operas Die Grundriss der Kunst : Anfangslied ( 1882 ) and Die Verantwortungstentheater, two short stories based on the novels by Friedrich Schiller ( Dingenzehns, trompflanzen, 1918 ). Rodiałowicz would write his own music in 1939 and 1939-1939 published an edition of Die Grundriss der Kunst.

 He served as teacher of medicine and surgery in the Belfast Hospital, and was also appointed to the chair of physiology at Queen's University in Belfast. After graduation, he was called to the bar, but spent most of his career at King's College, London. He was also called to the chair of theological investigations and one of the most eminent divines of the time, a few months before he died. In the past, he received funding from the government and to this end he co-founded the Society for Promoting Universal Knowledge ( Psallicp ( Hb. Zóp ) ). One of his doctrines is that God did not create man, but instead, was the first man on earth. This does not mean that he thought that man was a useless vegetative species. He taught his own children the importance of charity, which was taught by the practice of this philosophy in his philosophy lectures. In 1847 he met Baron Auguste de La Touche ( 1765-1846 ), then mayor of Paris, and came to know him well. In 1778 Clarke was elected to the Royal Society of Arts, but retired from the society when he found that so many of his members were not devout Christians. He was also of a philosophical sensitiveness, an influence on William Howells Tyrie and Rudolf Steiner. He died of kidney cancer at the Kings'Hospital, Belfast, on 18 January 1797. He was buried in Norwich, Essex.

 = Rudolf Kreisler =  
Rudolf Kreisler ( 25 March 1876 – 9 February 1954 ) was an Austrian physicist who made contributions to electrical conductivity, thermodynamics and scattering. He was an early pioneer of X-ray crystallography and the best known crystal-crystallographer at the time. He is often credited as the first crystallographer to observe liquid crystals, but this claim is false, as he was not the first to observe crystal-crystallographic phenomena. The paper describing the phenomenon is now known as Kirchhoff-Kreisler's analysis. He is known for the use of electric discharges. He also invented the Kreisler cell, a coil of electrically conductive wire.  
   
   
 == Education and early career ==  
 Rudolf Kreisler was born in Halle and received an early education in mathematics, physics and mathematics in Lausanne. He worked for a time in the mining industry in Bohemia and then worked as a carpenter in Frankfurt am Main. Kreisler obtained his doctorate in Berlin in 1902 with a thesis on the critical condition of neutron-proton pairs. During his time in the laboratory, he completed a fundamental study of the electric current in the atmosphere, which is at the center of modern X-ray spectroscopy.From 1903 to 1908 Kreisler taught elementary and high school in Hamburg. In 1909 he worked as a demonstrator for a year at the Gewerbeinnenraue Technische Hochschule in Halle. Kreisler was appointed professor of electrical engineering in 1911 and in 1913 became a faculty member at the Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule.  
 In 1913 Kreisler started a German textbook in X-ray crystallography. In 1916 Kreisler founded the Institute for X-Ray Crystallography at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Technical Research in Karlsruhe. He was succeeded in the institute in 1918 by Carl Jacoby, who maintained connections with Kreisler and made Kreisler a director. In 1920 Kreisler was the editor of the journal Optik.With Max Hermann, he developed a large number of X-ray crystallographic experiments. In 1926 he invented the Kreisler cell, which measures the fluorescence of X-ray diffracted light. The colorimetric gel cells were used during an X-ray crystallographic experiment to calculate the number of individual atoms on the surface of gold.In 1927 Kreisler was the first to model the diffusion of liquids through crystals. In 1933, Kreisler discovered that different conduction paths are available for liquids with the same carbon content.In 1935 Kreisler invented an X-ray diffraction microscope which allowed him to study molecules and molecules of different types and proportions. He discovered that X-ray crystals are distinguishable from one another because of a faint shift of emission ( Kreisler-Horn ). Kreisler studied the effect of carbon dioxide on magnetic moments. Kreisler's discovery gave the theoretical basis for carbon dioxide molecular signals. With Howard Silliman, Kreisler became a member of the faculty at the University of Vienna.  
   
   
 == X-ray crystallography ==  
 Kreisler showed that carbon dioxide with similar carbon content, such as that found in the soil, had different magnetic properties than that of the soil.Kreisler applied his results to studying X-ray diffraction microscopy. A large part of Kreisler's work was concerned with optical transitions. He investigated the spectral composition of electrical discharges from passing carriages through lines of conductive wire. He considered how X-ray diffraction resolved a spectrum of few wavelengths of light and about what elements were present in the discharge.  
 He was a founder of the Institute for X-ray Crystallography, which was later merged with the University of Giessen's Department of Chemistry. Kreisler was elected as one of the founders of the Royal Society in 1914. His name was attached to the X-ray microscopy in 1924 by Wilhelm Friedrich von Rath, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Fritz, Gerhard Müller, Rudolf Schermer and August I. Herder.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 Kreisler became concerned with the mass production of high temperature liquid crystals, and moved to Gewerbeinnenraue. He established the Kreisler Alcoolatorium ( the first of its kind in Germany ) in 1919 in Gewerbeinnenraue. He died in Gewerbeinnenraue in 1954. He is buried in Karlsruhe cemetery.

Miguel Kast Rist ( December 18 , 1948 - September 18 , 1983 ) was a German-born Chilean economist of the Chicago Boys group . He was most known for his role in public policies , where he promoted a greater focus of resources toward the needy.Upon getting his Master in Economics at University of Chicago , Miguel Kast joined Odeplan ( 1973 ) , the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973 . At Odeplan , Miguel Kast focused most of his energies on creating the `` map of extreme poverty '' , which would become the cornerstone of Chile 's social development programs . In 1978 he became the head of Odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join Odeplan and by sending them to the country 's outer regions to get insight into the real problems of Chile .   
 In 1980 Miguel Kast became Labor Minister under the Military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and in 1982 he became Governor of the Central Bank of Chile .   
 This was a complicated moment in Chile 's economy ; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and Chile 's big economic groups had liabilities with their own banks . As a Central Banker he worked to reduce the level of related loans ( loans made to the owners of the banks ) . He also created a mechanism called the `` Portfolio Sale '' through which the Central Bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks . By keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar , Miguel Kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars . However the central authority saw it otherwise and on June 13 , 1982 decided to devalue the peso . This brought a sharp loss of international reserves and Miguel Kast decided in August 1982 to completely free exchange rate thus further devaluing the peso and bringing a new intervention from the central authority . Under this new threat of instability , Miguel Kast resigned from the Central Bank .   
 Only few months after his resignation , in January 1983 , Miguel Kast learned he had bone cancer . He died on September 18 of the same year .   
 In recognition of Miguel Kast 's work , the Atlas Economic Research Foundation created an award named after him to recognise the Latin American think tank which has made the most important contribution to help reduce poverty.Two of his relatives are involved in politics too : his younger brother José Antonio , and one of his children , Felipe .

John Slade ( 1662–1741 ) was an English meteorologist. He was a native of Isleworth and studied at Southwell in Wiltshire, where he graduated M.A. in 1723, afterwards being a tutor for Sir John Balfour.  
 He was employed by General Gage's Company as a meteorological laborer from 1728 to 1732. The Company was examining the coal fields in the Northern districts. He found that the better natural conditions to manufacture coal would be reached by farmstead workers, while there was no cultivation on the sugar plantations of the Marshalls or other northern districts. Further, he gave evidence of the necessity for a railway from Middlesex and the Downs to London and Southampton, and pointed out the difficulties of building the new Ironwork and the difficulty of retaining the production of wool. He was also a leading observer in seeing the meteorological effects of increasing rainfall.

Alexandre Joseph Émile Brumpt ( 10 March 1877 , Paris – 8 July 1951 ) was a French parasitologist.He studied zoology and parasitology in Paris , obtaining his degree in science in 1901 , and his medical doctorate in 1906 . In 1919 he succeeded Raphaël Blanchard ( 1857-1919 ) as professor of parasitology to the Faculté de Médecine de Paris , a position he maintained until 1948 . Much of his career was spent performing research in Africa and Latin America .   
 Brumpt is credited for introducing a technique known as xenodiagnosis into parasitological research .   
 In 1935 he described Plasmodium gallinaceum , an avian malarial parasite that infects chickens and other fowl . He also conducted important research involving the African tsetse fly ( Glossina palpalis ) as a biological vector for trypanosomiasis . In addition , he did extensive studies of the diseases : schistosomiasis , Chagas disease , onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis .   
 He described Blastocystis hominis and Entamoeba dispar . The latter species helped to explain why most people who appeared to be infected with Entamoeba histolytica were asymptomatic . However , because there are no morphological differences between the two species , his proposal was largely ignored for over 50 years before being proven correct using molecular techniques.The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Prix Savigny for 1910 . A number of parasitic species bear his name , including Plasmodium brumpti and Xenocoeloma brumpti . Also , a genus of phlebotomine sand flies , Brumptomyia , and a species of Corsican mosquito , Culex brumpti , are named after him .   
 Brumpt 's best known written work is Précis de Parasitologie , which was published in six editions between 1910 and 1949 . He was the author of many scientific papers , including several on the Anopheles mosquito and its relationship to malaria . He was the President of the Société zoologique de France in 1922 . With Maurice Neveu-Lemaire and Maurice Langeron , he founded in 1923 the parasitological journal Annales de Parasitologie Humaine et Comparée , now continued as Parasite .

 = Akhmet Bulut =  
Akhmet Bulut ( 3 May 1909 – 27 March 1997 ) was a Turkish economist and economist. He was the grandson of Akhmet Bulut.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Akhmet Bulut's hometown in the far northwest of Turkey, Akhmet Bulut studied economics, law, philosophy and history at a university in Istanbul. He obtained his PhD in 1933. In 1936 he joined the Turkish Faculty of Political Science.  
 In 1941 he emigrated to the United States. From 1950 to 1955 he worked as a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, the university's main research center.  
 In 1963 he left Vanderbilt and became Director of the Center for Economic and International Studies at the University of Oxford, where he worked with Neville A. Chamberlain. In 1970 he became a visiting professor at the same university, then in 1971–1975 he was professor emeritus. At Oxford, he was known as the patron of the discipline of economic geography.  
 In the early 1970s, he started working as a fellow at the Center for International Studies of the New School for Social Research, which he would depart from in 1979. Bulut was honored with honorary doctorates from the Johns Hopkins University, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Michigan, and the University of Edinburgh, and in 1988 the University of Toronto awarded him the McLellan Prize in Economics and Economics of Human Values.  
 Bulut's influence on globalization also extends beyond his own home country. In the 1980s, he played a role in the formation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. As a result of his work at the World Bank, the Institute for International Economic Studies ( IES ) was born. The IES developed a program in economics called `` The World Economy '' that advanced the work of Abdullah Iraklyan of the International Institute for Social Studies ( ISS ), which before him was primarily focused on German and Soviet studies. IES financed Bulut's translation of Friedrich von Hayek's Social Statics into Turkish in 1987 and another called Welfare Economics in 1990.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Bulut saw the wage distribution system of classical monetarist economics, and modern Keynesian economics, as a model for what should replace that system. He argued that every advanced country should follow the world's current currency scheme, in order to achieve its financial objectives. Like Keynes, he saw the market as an interdependent and mutually reinforcing process between government and non-government actors.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 While serving as Director of the Center for Economic and International Studies at the University of Oxford from 1969 to 1973, Bulut was one of the few prominent economists from the middle and far-right to explore in depth a range of controversial issues in the political world of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The party he helped found, the Liberaltarian Party, has a close relationship with Turkey's Radical Party, who have their own highly unorthodox view of modern economics. He was even one of the six Turkish figures who received honors by former Prime Minister of Turkey, Abdullah Gul, for his contributions to Turkish public discourse. Bulut is also remembered for founding the moderate scholar think tank Semiatik on behalf of the Turkish academic community in 1971.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Bulut married Laura Greiss in 1937 and they had two sons, Alexander Huzi Bulut ( later Gülen ) and Fereydin Şıkılmaz. In 1980 Bulut married Emma Munsen, a fellow Australian anthropologist who studied with him at Oxford.

Konstantin Leonidovich Laksov ( Russian : Никола́ндр Сорович Иванов ; 7 July [ O.S. 13 September ] 1905 – 29 September 1990 ) was a Soviet physicist and a leading authority on particle physics.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Leonid Aleksandrovich Laksov was born in the village of Novogrodcheniye ( now Tomsk ) in the Kherson Governorate, a Tatar Autonomous Okrug region. He was interested in science since childhood. From 1908 he studied in the Leningrad State University, graduating with an an M.Sc. degree in 1926.  
 In 1926, he obtained his Ph.D. at the Moscow State University under the supervision of Isaac Khachaturian. In 1927 he was appointed Professor of the Department of Physics at the University of Leningrad, where he remained until 1939, when he was named to the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was a leading figure in the research of Collisions, or Inertial and Electrodynamic Physics, and an important influence in the Soviet nuclear-revolution. His numerous scientific publications ( Ph.D. and M.Sc. ) included theoretical work on the theory of the kinematic and exciton scattering in liquids ( his name appears in synonyms for Max Born and Vincenzo Vaidra ), the physics of energy transfer in gases, and the mechanics of the relativistic macroscopic interactions between a charged particle and an extended particle. In 1947 he returned to Leningrad. In 1966, he was appointed head of the Physics Department of the University of Moscow. His most important works are listed in the research guide on colliders and velocities published by Laksov in 1984.Although Laksov was elected a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1949, his time in that post was not recognised in the official Soviet science history, which did not mention him. He was eventually appointed to a chair at the University of Leningrad, but this was only for an academic year. In the early 1950s, he published several papers on time dilation, a theorem in which he showed that the equivalent of the free-falling speed of light is equal to the approximate speed of sound, a finding which, he felt, would improve the problem of the theories of inertial and electrodynamic fields. Laksov in the 1960s issued several novels and plays, and a film in 1969, Mileva Podlaskova, with a fictional Soviet nuclear reactor physics program.In 1977, the United States'Atomic Energy Commission awarded Laksov the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the 1970s he expressed a desire to work with a Soviet particle accelerator and made several proposals for their development.

During World War II , Lippi and her mother lived in Florence , Italy , where she worked as a nurse . She also joined the Italian resistance against the Nazis.Lippi married Fred Selkregg in 1945 . They had three children : Alicia , Sheila , and Leif.Lidia Selkregg trained as a geologist . She received her doctorate degree from the University of Illinois in Champaign.The Selkreggs moved to Alaska in 1958 . Lidia Selkregg worked as a planner in Anchorage . She wrote the Economic Development Administration Grant for the Port of Anchorage , and she fought to protect land for the Anchorage watershed.In the aftermath of the 1964 Alaska earthquake , the most powerful recorded earthquake in U.S. history , a small group of professional geologists , led by Selkregg , then a geologist with the Alaska State Housing Authority , were authorized by the housing authority and city officials to outline immediate courses of action . The Engineering Geology Evaluation Group was formed , consisting of a volunteer team of local geologists , engineering geologists , and soil scientists . Starting just two days after the earthquake , the group mapped the entire earthquake area and obtained aerial photographs of the damage . They also measured all of the vertical and horizontal displacements in the area . They released a preliminary report on April 14 , 1964 , and a final report on May 8 , 1964 . This report was later used by the Scientific and Engineering Task Force , appointed by the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission for Alaska , to make recommendations about stability in the wake of the earthquake.Selkregg also worked to get the population of Valdez to move away from the previous site of their town . In the years after the earthquake , she worked to raise awareness among the public about earthquake risk.From 1971 to 1985 , Selkregg was a professor of resources and socioeconomic planning and regional planning at the University of Alaska Anchorage , where she developed a graduate planning program . She was the editor of the `` Environmental Atlas of the Greater Anchorage Area Borough , '' published by the University of Alaska in 1972.Selkregg served on the Advisory Committee to the Carter White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development ; she also served in the Anchorage Assembly . As a member of the Assembly , she helped create the city 's network of trails and parks.Selkregg died on August 14 , 1999 . She was inducted into the Alaska Women 's Hall of Fame in 2009 .

 = Nikolai Golovanov =   
Nikolai Semyonovich Golovanov ( Russian : Никола́й Семёнович Голова́нов , Nikoláy Semyónovich Golovánov ) ( [ o.s . 9 ] 21 January 1891 – 28 August 1953 ) , PAU , was a Soviet conductor and composer , who was married to the soprano Antonina Nezhdanova .   
 He conducted the premiere performances of a number of works , among them Nikolai Myaskovsky 's Sixth Symphony in May 1924.Golovanov held some of the highest musical positions in the USSR , including an extensive association with the Bolshoi Opera . In her autobiography , Galina Vishnevskaya terms him the theater 's chief conductor , and tells of his dismissal from the Bolshoi and his death - which she attributed to the humiliation of the experience of losing this position . It has been reported that Golovanov 's firing was the result of Stalin 's displeasure at Golovanov 's having tried to use a Jewish singer , Mark Reizen , in the title role of Tsar Boris Godunov in his recording of Mussorgsky 's opera . Golovanov actually did record the opera with Reizen as Boris , but later remade Reizen 's part with another Boris , Alexander Pirogov .   
 Golovanov 's recorded output was substantial and quite individual in interpretive approach . In his discography we find all but one of the Liszt tone poems , the complete Scriabin symphonies and Piano Concerto , Tchaikovsky 's First and Sixth symphonies , as well as shorter works , Beethoven 's First Symphony , Violin Concerto and Triple Concerto , Rimsky-Korsakov 's Scheherazade and his operas Sadko and Christmas Eve , Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov and Pictures at an Exhibition , Rachmaninoff 's Second and Third symphonies , the opera Aleko and other compositions , Glazunov 's Fifth , Sixth and Seventh symphonies , and scores by Grieg , Mozart and others . Based upon the evidence of his recordings , Golovanov 's characteristic performance mode was full-blooded and nearly vehement in tone , with a powerful , almost overloaded sense of sonority , and extreme flexibility in matters of tempo , phrasing and dynamics .   
 In addition to audio recordings by Golovanov , there is extant visual representation of his conducting style . Possibly during the Second World War , evidently intended as a morale booster , there was produced a film of Golovanov conducting a group called the USSR State Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the Tchaikovsky `` 1812 Overture . '' As was the practice in the USSR , the Tsarist anthem was replaced in the score with the chorus `` Glory , Glory to you , holy Russia ! '' from Glinka 's `` A Life for the Tsar . '' The film does not feature synchronous sound , and concerns itself primarily with various Soviet functionaries , Military figures and Orthodox Priests ( ! ) in the audience ; However , the short segments of Golovanov conducting show an energetic but physically spare conducting style , one seemingly at odds with the sometimes extreme nature of his interpretations .   
 Golovanov was also a composer ; his works include the opera `` Princess Yurata '' , a symphony and other orchestral works as well as choral music .

Georges-Alexandre Victor Ion ( 22 January 1823 in St Gallen, France – 28 December 1901 in Geneva, Switzerland ) was a Swiss mineralogist and physicist. He made important contributions to mineralogy and the theory of graphites, in particular when he demonstrated the existence of amorphous amorphous crystals in graphite. This was preceded by decades of work in crystallography. He was also the father of structural geologists.Ion developed what he called `` ley lines '' in graphite. In 1892 he suggested that the grains have been arranged in odd numbered sets. The idea of rearranging the ordered numbers allowed him to perform mathematical equations related to their locations on a crystal surface. Ion was director of the laboratory of crystal identification from 1891 until his retirement in 1908. He was president of the Institute of Mineralogy in the Swiss canton of Hesse from 1899 to 1902. He was the corresponding editor of the Journal of Petrography from 1877 to 1895 and was the editor of the Journal of the American Society of Mineralogists from 1887 to 1898.

Frederic Andrews Gibbs ( 1903–1992 ) was an American neurologist who was a pioneer in the use of electroencephalography ( EEG ) for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy .   
 Gibbs graduated from Yale and Johns Hopkins in 1929 . He was offered a fellowship in neuropathology by Stanley Cobb , of Harvard Medical School . He studied epilepsy in the same laboratory as William G. Lennox and Erna Leonhardt .   
 Erna Leonhardt was Lennox 's technical co-worker and had come to Boston as an immigrant from Germany . [ 1 ] She married Gibbs in 1930 and they formed a research team that would last a lifetime , publishing papers together over the next fifty-odd years .   
 The electroencephalograph was primitive in the early 1930s , having only one channel . In 1935 , Gibbs asked Albert Grass ( an MIT graduate ) to build a 3-channel EEG . Grass built the machine in his father 's basement with the help of his brother . In the same year , Erna and Frederic Gibbs travelled to Europe to attend a conference and visit Hans Berger , the inventor of the EEG . [ 2 ] In 1944 , they moved to University of Illinois School of Medicine , and Frederic Gibbs was promoted to professor in the epilepsy clinic .   
 The Gibbs published the book `` Atlas of electroencephalography '' in 1941 , with a second edition in 1951 . Their book valued the subjective and experienced eye of an electroencephalographer over objective mechanical or mathematical analysis . [ 3 ] Frederic Gibbs was jointly ( with William Lennox ) awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1951 .

 = Manuel Prado Ugarteche =   
Manuel Carlos Prado y Ugarteche ( April 21 , 1889 – August 15 , 1967 ) was a banker who served twice as President of Peru . Son of former president Mariano Ignacio Prado , he was born in Lima and served as the nation 's 50th ( 1939 - 1945 ) and 54th ( 1956 - 1962 ) President . His brother , Leoncio Prado Gutiérrez , was a military hero who died in 1883 , six years before Manuel Prado was born .   
 As a young army officer , Prado was a key player in the coup that overthrew peruvian president Guillermo Billinghurst in 1914 . He became president of the Central Reserve Bank in 1934 .   
 Manuel Prado , a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family , reached the presidency of Peru with the help of the left-wing Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana party . Prado announced that `` one of the first acts of my government will be to declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties . ''   
 During Prado 's second presidency ( 1956–1962 ) , the only significant proscribed party was the APRA ( American Popular Revolutionary Alliance ) , which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría . Prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected Congress a bill to legalize APRA once again . The bill was later passed and the APRA 's famed founder , Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre , returned from foreign exile .   
 In foreign policy , Prado – whose greatest pride was that as President in 1942 he made Peru the first of the South American nations to break off relations with the Axis Powers– was expected to side firmly with the U.S . There is documentary evidence that shows that Prado 's enthusiastic support of the deportation of Peruvians of Japanese descent to the United States during World War II was motivated by a desire to rid Peru of all of its Japanese-descended residents—a charge which some historians have argued amounted to a campaign of ethnic cleansing .

 = Bruno Degeirw C3 A1n =  
Bruno Degeirwàn ( German : [ ɡɡu-fɔn ] ; 19 July 1864 – 24 January 1962 ) was a German-born American neurologist and psychiatrist. He was one of the leading neurologists of his generation. He was a notable exponent of the electrophysiological and electroencephalogram approach.  
 Degeirwàn was born in Fieglitz near Schücken. As an undergraduate, he earned a doctorate at Göttingen, and then a master's degree in 1881 and 1882 at the University of Berlin, where he attained an MA in 1889. In 1896, he took a job in the neurology department at the St. Louis Hospital, where he remained until 1908. After leaving the St. Louis Hospital in 1908, he became a demonstrator in psychoacoustics and later a professor in neurological neurology and neurosurgery at the University of Berlin.  
 Degeirwàn's work covered brain structure, distribution, structure of ganglia, and function. He served as director of the Berlin Pharmacopoeia from 1905 to 1907, and served as vice-president of the St. Louis Hospital from 1910 to 1914. He was president of the American Psychological Association from 1914 to 1916, and from 1922 to 1924 he was its president. He served as director of the New York City Hospital from 1929 to 1932, and was appointed to the chair of the psychiatry department at the Medical College of Columbia University in 1934. In 1936 he was awarded the Albert Einstein Memorial Prize in Neurophysiology.  
 After returning to Berlin in 1938, Degeirwàn returned to the United States, taking over as director of the neuropsychiatric hospital department at the Imperial College Hospital, where he retired in 1945. He died at home in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 87. His son, Boerhilde Degeirwàn, is also an influential neurologist.Degeirwàn conducted pioneering research into nervous conduction. One of his studies was investigating the relation between depression and the thoracic spine and spinal cord. He hypothesized that depression affects the phalangeal process of the spinal cord through corticosteroid action, leading to a disruption in the pattern of electrical activity in the spinal cord. This type of disruption is an indicator of the subglial origin of depression, and therefore that depression is associated with sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. He concluded that, because depression increases the risk of spinal-cord injury, it should be regarded as a form of `` glucocorticoid-induced arthritic disease ''. He was known for his studies of specific neurotransmitters, and he proposed that neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. He concluded that these neurotransmitters are necessary for normal brain function, and research related to his work has been cited by more than two hundred researchers and neurologists. His research led him to explain and put into practice a model of spinocerebellar dysfunction that has been described by other investigators. He also summarized the results of studies involving stroke, back pain, migraine, convulsions, and back problems, and he discussed the historical origins of the mental disorder of phlebitis. His late essays have been translated into many languages, including Persian, Italian, German, Italian and Dutch.  
 He was one of the first to observe that the first stages of life have a complex relationship to the development of brains. Early stages of brain development were stable or stable, but in later stages, stages 2 and 3 of brain development show a more or less irregular pattern. He summarized these early stages of brain development and identified major phases of the brain during childhood : auditory ( affect ), visual ( action ), motor ( vision ), and sensory ( memory ) stages.Degeirwàn served as editor of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences from 1928 until 1948, and the American Journal of Psychiatry from 1935 until 1950.Degeirwàn earned the Franklin Institute of the Advancement of Medical Science Medal in 1935.

 He began his career as a court surgeon, but shortly after became a follower of the naturalist Josiah Warren. Ponius subsequently studied anatomy at the University of Leipzig.  
 In 1836, he began teaching anatomy to young children at the Jagiellonian University of Vienna. In the following years, he conducted additional research in tectonics, cartography, zoology, hydraulics, and animal husbandry. In 1852 he moved to the United States where he continued his work on the mechanical advantage of homeopathic remedies. In 1856, he was elected to the International Academy of Medical Sciences. He was also the father of Paul Ponius, an anatomist.  
   
   
 == Important achievements ==  
 In 1841, he demonstrated that the spiracular volume of the skull contains 60 % of the total volume of the nasal cavity and 40 % of the volume of the subnasal cavity, confirming earlier speculation on craniofacial development by Steven Gairdner. In 1844, he determined that the upper, apical, and distal nasal nerves belong to the lateral and posterior cranial nerves of the skull.From 1857, Ponius characterized the blood supply in the nasal cavity. This was widely used to explain the sensation of nasal congestion that is common with chronic nasal diseases.  
 Ponius made a significant contribution to the science of embryology, known today as hemodynamics. He made extensive, cross-sectional studies of the development of mammalian ovum, shown by Paul Noël.

 = Christoph B. Neumann =  
Christoph Wilhelm Neumann ( 23 September 1877 – 10 May 1965 ) was a German-born scientist and sociologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Christoph Wilhelm Neumann was born in Stuttgart on 23 September 1877 and emigrated to the United States in 1912. He was a music professor in Stuttgart and became active in the social sciences in the US. He taught for 30 years at Brown University. In 1919 he completed a doctorate at Johns Hopkins University.  
 He became professor of Economics at the University of Chicago from 1931-1948, and from 1948 until his retirement in 1975 became dean of the Graduate School of Public Administration.  
 In his first book ( 1946 ) he defended the contributions of labor theory in the theory of population sociology, later reopening this idea with his most influential book, The Economic Origins of Population ( 1947 ). This began the current trend in demographic and social sociology that economists claim is a response to the `` energy crisis '' of World War II, a conflict in which technological modernization led to increased demand for the working class and an increase in the status of women and of racial minorities.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Neumann examined the role of the concentration of wages in industrial production, to determine how unemployment affected consumption.  
 Neumann believed that the effects of technology could be exploited by the employing classes, and published studies that he hoped would be used as a lesson in urban sociology. In a 1941 article he wrote about the economic education of low-income children, he predicted that such courses would help lower-class children to develop an understanding of the values and values of competition. He did however draw a comparison with Marxism, in that it taught children to think critically. For example, Neumann predicted that Marx's criticism of the contradiction between proletariat's economic interest in the production of surplus value and capitalist exploitation of labour would contribute to the emergence of a concept of `` laddism '' in the worker's class consciousness that would inform future counter-revolutionary thinking.  
   
 Neumann's focus on wages was influential during the post-war `` Third Industrial Revolution '' in which wages were a major political issue. Following a revolution in 1947 for which Neumann was best known, wages took a back seat for working-class resistance to cuts in state services. Wages in Germany and in other developed capitalist countries have since been on a steady upward trajectory. When it came to matters of wages, by the 1950s the human demand theory that Neumann developed, similar to Walter Reed's, had been widely applied in the development of neo-liberalism. Neumann warned that the `` pace of technological advance has outstripped Marx's vision of a dialectical progression of technology that eventually transcends capitalism and arrives at socialism ''. During this period, Neumann also began developing the notion of labor supply and demanded that society institute policies that would increase it, proposing the concept of `` socialized labor '' in a 1948 article.

 Neumann married his wife, Anna, in 1924. They had five children, one of whom became a statistician. He was also a pianist, violinist and harpsichordist.

 = John L C3 BCten =  
John Francis Benjamin Campden ( 22 August 1886 – 15 February 1976 ) was a Canadian geologist and professor of geology and paleontology at Dalhousie University. His primary research focus is the geology and paleontology of Newfoundland and Labrador and he is best known for his use of highly mobile ichthyosaurs as fossil material. He is known for the description of alligator-like morphology in the history of fossil mammals.Campden graduated from Dalhousie with a Bachelor of Science in 1889 and in 1894 joined the Geological Survey of Canada. He obtained his M.Sc. in 1906 from the University of Manitoba and his Ph.D. in 1912 from Yale University. He was then appointed Assistant Director of the McGill-Queen's Institute for Polar Exploration ( now known as the Dalhousie University Museum of Natural History ). At the same time he was also a Head Geologist at the Newfoundland Scientific Laboratory from 1904 to 1907.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Campden was born at St. Andrews, Nova Scotia, the second of seven children of John Charles ( 1856–1925 ) and his wife, a high school teacher. His father was the then Superintendent of Schools in St Andrews. John and his siblings became good friends of Louise Robertson-Donnan, a then only second-year girl.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He first became interested in geology as a student at Dalhousie University, where he was initially devoted to the family agricultural business, the Campden family-owned wool and fabric mill. In 1913, with the help of Englishman Clifford Gould, John and four of his siblings left Dalhousie University to attend University College, Oxford ( UCO ), where they took courses in the fields of paleontology and geology under the supervision of Thomas Brown. During World War I, they became engaged to Dr. Grace Effinger. In 1916 he was elected a Fellow of UCO. While working as an assistant in Calfain County, Wyoming, he became the first scientist to identify the fossil lake Foss Creek, which was named after him. In 1916, he joined the staff of the Geological Survey of Canada ( GSC ), and became Director of the geology section of the GSC's Research Laboratory for Fossils and Petroleum Geology. In 1917, he was appointed Assistant Director of the College of Tropical Sciences, now known as Dalhousie University, where he remained until 1940. After World War II, he left the GSC to serve as a lecturer in the Department of Science, University of Montreal.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Campden married Mary Auguste Morice in 1916 and they had two sons and a daughter. At the beginning of World War II, he was the second senior Canadian Scientist to abandon the military service. Campden then served in the Canadian Forces Reserve until the end of the war in 1946.  
 In the wake of the end of the Second World War, Campden continued his research, writing several books including :  
   
 Evolutionary Consequences of Fossilism ( 1926 ).  
 A Guide to Natural History ; ( 1929 ) with Albert J. Wetmore  
 A Dinosaur Calf Digs Up the Ground ( 1933 )

 The Bibliographic Record of Old Sea Vegetation ( 1943 ).  
   
   
 == Honours and awards ==  
 John L. Campden was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1914, was appointed Member of the Canadian Academy of Science in 1920, the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1929 and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1935. In 1935, he was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for his research in geology. In the same year he was appointed a Canadian Member of the Royal Society of London.  
 His collection of remains, which includes the fossil enamel of a large, winged ammonite known as the Campden amphibian, was donated to Dalhousie University in 1940.  
 He was elected a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences in 1969.  
 Campden is the founder of Dalhousie University's Campden Award.

 = Charles Lambert Roger =  
Charles Lambert Roger ( 23 April 1875 – 25 November 1955 ) was a British scientist, known as one of the first English physicists to measure electromagnetic radiation.  
 He discovered what is known as the Hertz resonance, a resonance constant related to the electromagnetic radiation inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave. In this equation is created the Lambert's ratio, which measures the proportion of a given value of electromagnetic radiation inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.  
 Roger was born in London, the son of Robert Roger of New Kensington. Roger was educated at Eton College and Harrow School, studying electrical engineering under Max Norden. During World War I he served as a Lieutenant, afterwards graduating from St John's College, Cambridge.  
 The following year he joined Imperial College London as a lecturer in physics, where he remained until the war. In 1922, he became the first Professor of Physics at Imperial. He gave numerous lectures on optics and in 1929 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. During this period he had also made large contributions to radio astronomy, and he had also investigated the gravitational influence of cosmic rays. He died on 25 November 1955.

 = John Ray Hubbard (geologist) =  
John Ray Hubbard ( 7 June 1907 – 23 July 1982 ) was an Australian-born geologist and prominent proponent of the notion that Australia was most likely the cradle of civilisation.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 John Ray Hubbard was born on 7 June 1907 in Sandringham, Queensland. He had two brothers, Gerald and George, who all went on to achieve leading positions in industry and science. He studied geology at Melbourne University ( 1921-24 ) and received his BSc ( 1925 ) and MSc ( 1925 ) from Sydney University. He was awarded a visiting professorship from the University of California, Berkeley ( 1928 ) and was a student of Sir Alfred North Whitehead, an authority on the human genealogy. In 1930 he was awarded the Mosman Medal, the highest honour of Australian university academics.He retired from the University of Sydney in 1968. He taught at Griffith University, a government school, from 1971 to 1972. He also was the Australian Secretary of the World Academy of Sciences from 1969 to 1972.  
   
   
 == Influence ==  
 As a scientific advocate of the Aboriginal '' past, Hubbard shared the beliefs of anthropologist Edward Tolmie that Aboriginal cultures were settled by a stream of migrants from ancient lands who originally became citizens of Australia and migrated as inland settlers. He was also an early proponent of the idea that the Boer Wars with the British that nearly split the country was over land issues.  
 In a number of his books, Hubbard describes various myths and legends that influenced his thinking. In The Secret Life of an Aborigine he describes Aboriginal `` ceremonial ecstasy '' as a means of manipulating their humanity, defining an enemy as either an enemy of the tribe or their creator. In the same book, he claims that the Aborigine's Aboriginal name is Maat. Hubbard considered it a repugnant word that would vilify and dehumanise the aborigines and led him to retract the epithet. In the final chapters of his book, Hubbard lists some of the reasons for rejecting the ethnic origins of Aborigines, saying they are 'not good people. '' This is not the first time Hubbard had used the word '' butcher '', but his use of it makes it the most common the word has been used in Australian public speech.  
 Hubbard's use of the word also triggered a backlash, and his use of it led to public protests.  
 In his autobiography, Hubbard is said to have denied that he was a Jew. Hubbard's daughter Kristine also denied that Hubbard was a member of any illegal party or organisation.

John Irwin Sinclair ( 13 September 1842 – 9 February 1915 ) was a Scottish botanist.  
 Sinclair was born in Redruth. In 1888 he started work at the now defunct Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where he developed a particular interest in the mosses he found growing in the grounds. He later lived at Westfield House, where he built up an extensive collection of mosses, most of which was grown on the estate. In the 1840s he was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1851 was appointed curator of the plant section at Kew. In 1857 he moved to Newnham Abbey, London, where he set up a prolific garden and, in 1870, established the botanical and floral museum at his abbey. Sinclair's collection was given to the Kew Society.  
 He was the first person in Scotland to collect British species of fungi. Many of his work was characterized by close research and meticulous labelling, but his main work took him to the South-Western regions of England, France, Spain, and Norway, where he established and established a relationship with botanists such as James Chadwick, Ralph Rivers, Alexander Arnold and Lord Rayleigh. His collections can still be found at Kew Gardens in the form of tablets and microscopes.

 He studied engineering under Wilhelm von Liebig at the University of Tübingen, where he made important discoveries in solid-state physics, especially in photographic calorimetry, and on the speed of electricity.  
 In the winter of 1864–65 he was inspector of mining engineering at Metz, and as an assistant in the Metallurgical Institute ( Siemens ) at Braunschweig. In 1871–72 he was elected a member of the German Academy of Sciences and Letters, and in 1877–78 a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
 In 1879 Erziehung and Heinrich Locher-Wolff ( 1809–1887 ) were among the first in Europe to see the possibility of a method for extracting platinum from meteorites. This lead to discoveries in the mineralogy of rare elements, and new studies on the possibility of producing platinum from fissile uranium ( of which Germany is in a crisis ) and thorium ( of which no more than two countries have produced a period of history of this production ).  
 In 1887 he was elected the director of the Central Institute for Metallurgical Research in the city of Braunschweig, which had been established at that time to oversee this research. The institute, which still exists today, is among the leading research centers of the world.  
 Erziehung died in Braunschweig on 5 August 1915.

 He studied physics and became a full professor in 1917.  
 Korelitzky was a strong supporter of the theory of relativity, studying its principles of governing the behaviour of particles and of regularities in elasticity. In 1903, he was the first to prove the Lorentz transformation ( then known as the Lorentz transform ) for one of the fundamental particles, atomic hydrogen. Two years later, he showed that the same Transformation would not hold for all elementary particles, with a special `` incorrect '' case where one of the three observers were correct.  
 In 1905, he developed a theory based on the Lorentz transformation that could explain the structure of protons. Theory was proven by August Schrödinger in 1924 and was later popularized by Robert A. Millikan in the book Quantum mechanics. The result has been called the `` most significant discovery '' in the history of physics.In the laboratory of his father in Moscow, he developed the three-body problem and the Klein–Dahle problem, as well as the thin sheet paradox. In his subsequent research, he showed how to find three new quarks ( H+, H+2 and H2+ ) by solving the differential equations of the Schwinger–Gerlach constant that produced them and his telegram on 3 June 1928 expressing his complete agreement with the Standard Model. According to the theory, the transition from H+ to H2+ was not discovered until 1939 by the Argentine theoretical physicist Alfredo Rocha.  
 In 1941, he developed the so-called Dritsen fragment of the black hole and the Schwarzschild fragment.
