 = Eduard Riehl =  
Eduard August Josef Riehl ( 22 December 1849 – 9 April 1933 ) was a German painter and art historian, noted for his impressionistic paintings and his passion for the sciences.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Born in Halle an der Saale ( today's Czech Republic ), Riehl was educated at the Halle gymnasium and the Königsberg Academy, where his father was a student. In 1887, he enrolled at the University of Berlin and then entered the faculty of philosophy in 1889.Upon becoming a professor, Riehl devoted himself primarily to art and graduated in 1899. This friendship formed the basis of his collaboration with the mathematician August Otto von Hayek, the latter of whom he was a lifelong admirer. After his graduation, Riehl accepted an appointment as a professor at the University of Stuttgart and became an assistant professor in 1902, professor in 1905, and full professor in 1911.In 1896, he was appointed artistic director at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He held this position until 1910.In 1910, Riehl was appointed director of the Humboldt University of Berlin, a position which he held until 1916, when the university was transferred to Munich. The remainder of his career was spent at the Riehl-Koch-Werke Museum in Leipzig and the Institute for Historical Art and the Art of Guillaume-François Cabanis in London.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Influenced by the concepts of the German Romantic philosophy, Riehl took an interest in various branches of psychology and had a deeply significant influence on his successors in art. Riehl was a conservative member of the Société Impressionisme. In the field of mythology, he strove to find an identification between the expressive forms of the mythological images, as represented by the concrete sculptures, and the relations between thought and life in the painter's own consciousness.  
 In the influence of many influential early German romantic psychologists, such as Hermann Schelling and Carl Jung, Riehl wanted to pursue an interest in historical themes through his narrative. Riehl wrote a number of books on the theme of the history of art and ideas. His most influential works are Hermann Schelling and the Rhine : Die Weltkrankheit in der Hochschen Altertums ( 1900 ), and Deutschlands Geographie ( 1906 ). After suffering from various crises in his career, he was forced to resign from his chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and was succeeded by the theologian Josef Köhn, a man well versed in the study of German Romanticism and the philosophy of aesthetics, whose historiological style still remains influential.

 = Horace Mills =  
Horace Ralph Melville Mills ( March 26, 1881 – November 3, 1962 ) was an American mineralogist who did pioneering work in the field of experimental crystallography, known for crystallographic reconstructions of plants. Mills, an early pioneer in practical glass making in the USA, discovered a number of precious minerals, including rare earth elements and chondrules. Mills produced over fifty patents on his instruments, including several for commercial glassmaking and innovative manufacturing processes for glass to the United States'first silver nitrate refinery, powered by Phillips Waddington–Mills Co.  
 Mills died in a car accident while trying to make metal castings for a silver company's glazed specimens. Mills was buried in this same cemetery in Lewiston, Maine, where he was the first president of the Lewiston Natural History Society.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Mills was born in Pennsylvania to Theodore Melville and Jane Carol Thompson, both of whom worked in the state's mines. Mills earned a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1900, and worked in Pittsburgh for more than twenty years as an educator. Mills went on to graduate studies at the University of Utah as a mineralogist.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Mills discovered rare-earth elements in the 1880s, and discovered Chondrules in 1899. He made the first known crystallographic reconstructions of plants during the 1930s.  
 Mills initially studied glassmaking for over two decades in the area, beginning in 1897. During his career, he and his collaborators made hundreds of patents on glass and glassblowing equipment.  
 Mills lived his entire life in Lewiston, Maine, and died in 1962.

 = Svante Pääbo =  
Svante-Pääbo ( 20 March 1835 in Vidensköping – 5 August 1888 in Turku ) was a Finnish psychologist and ethnologist, born in Vidensköping. He studied philosophy and sociology in the gymnasium in Turku, and as a teacher in the school in Turku. He taught in three different institutions, one a primary school and one a secondary school, his primary school students also studied in these institutions.In 1886, Pääbo started studying anthropology under Knut Moller, a major influence of which was to decide for him a course of studies in the history of ethnology. His main focus in that field of study was in the study of the Finns, and the nation's story, especially the history of their nation. He travelled to numerous parts of Europe, not only from England, but also from France, Belgium, and Belgium-Netherlands. He became an assistant at the university in Turku, the University of Karelia, and the Stellalanda Academy of Business and Economics. After graduating, he worked for ten years as a teacher and assistant professor in the universities of Karelia, Turku, and Vilnius, gaining various awards and decorations.Pääbo's vast knowledge and talent for theory were similar to that of the early-industrializing Berggruen who had no empirical ground in the ethnographic studies of the nineteenth century.Pääbo was a major contributor in research of the Finns.In 1887 he made the first Finnish ethnographic survey of Estonia. For two years before this he had been director of the Estonian archive, although he had no experience of an ethnographic field. In 1891 he visited Austria as an officer of the police. In 1896, he worked as an ethnographer for the Western Mission. In 1898, he traveled to Russia. Between 1904 and 1905 he worked as a personal secretary to the Russian Minister of National Industry and Agriculture in St Petersburg. In 1906, he was given the chair of the Department of Ethnology at the University of Helsinki. In 1909, he was a lecturer at the University of Turku. From 1912 to 1920, he was a professor at the University of Turku, then in 1924 he was the director of the Department of Ethnology at the University of Turku, and in 1926 he retired as professor at the University of Helsinki.

Jean-Marie Voisin ( ; French : [ ʁukən faisio ] ; 26 April 1777 – 19 January 1831 ) was a French mathematician and philosopher.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Voisin was born in Geneva, the son of a local tailor and a Protestant minister. His father died when Voisin was three, and he went to live with the widowed sister of his uncle. From 1809 to 1811 Voisin lived with his sister in La Gorgone in the province of Tuscany, then he went to Geneva, where he went to study mathematics and physics at the Sorbonne under Edmond Halévy.  
 In 1814, Voisin married Marie Henriette Abbé, the daughter of a newspaper editor. They had a daughter, Marion. In 1822 he married, with his wife, Katherine Félix, also a philosopher.  
 In Geneva, his interests diverged sharply from the orthodox physics of his mother and her husband. Voisin was outspoken in his favour of Free Radical philosophy ; he defended Monty Hallis and others that held that art was superior to science. He favoured compromise, rather than adventurism. His main follower was Gaspard Auguste Comte.

 = Giuseppe Tanca =  
Giuseppe Tanca ( 11 September 1782 – 24 July 1843 ) was an Italian naturalist, zoologist, and paleontologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Tanca was born in Lodi, where his family had settled several years before. His parents, Ademola Francesco Tanca ( 1782–1844 ) and Elena Tanca ( 1783–1843 ) were both wealthy and wealthy, having a clear taste for the well-being of the common person. Tanca's early life was spent in an Italian academy that was the leading institution of learning in Italy at the time.  
 The young Tanca could draw and use the most basic zoological knowledge. The chief problem to be solved was to see if any trace of fossil animals could be found in the Earth, at that time the most productive geological resources in the world. Tanca studied in the same gymnasium as other renowned naturalists, such as Sir Joseph Banks, Isaac Newton and Archibald Spencer.Tanca also studied physics and chemistry, and wrote short works on these subjects. After his graduation he joined the anatomical laboratory of the archaeologist J. Schleiermacher. This was an extraordinary laboratory for the time, being a state museum of Egypt, the discoverer of the First Pyramid of Giza.  
 At this time Tanca began to treat in much greater detail the phanerogams of insects. An opportunity to visit the ancient botanical garden of Florence's Scuola Sarmiento ( all around it were the preserved skeletons of more than 150 famous Lepidopterists, from around the world ) presented him with the idea of an expedition to Asia, a goal that aroused the excitement of the Florence Academy, and also provided him with an opportunity to collect as many insect fossils as possible. Before his departure for Asia, Tanca developed a theory of animal camouflage that was much more direct than the attempts by other investigators. The hypothesis predated Napoleonic campaigns in Asia. Its explanation was a reservoir of water that the insect hid in the larvae.  
 In early April 1804 Tanca and his scientific crew arrived at the site of the Pyramids of Giza. They found that the Sphinx had been reinforced with elaborate brickwork. Tanca completed his scientific work before leaving for Asia.  
 At his death in 1843 Tanca's collections reached an estimated 400,000 specimens.

Wilhelm Eduard Heinrich Apurin ( 26 August 1761 – 20 August 1820 ) was a German orientalist, art collector, and merchant.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Apurin was born at Kundtstadt ( now in Bremerhaven ) in the Prussian Province of Hanover. He studied philology at the University of Berlin, with Felix Gustav Schleiermacher ( 1768–1848 ). The following year, Apurin won a scholarship to study at Leipzig. Upon his return to Germany he worked as a concertmaster at the Hamburg Opera until his retirement in 1824.In 1810 Apurin moved to Basel, where he became a staff member of the Prussian Academy of Arts. From 1814 to 1817 he lived in Berlin, where he was on the artistic staff of the Linz Conservatory. In 1818 he became director of the `` Heinrich Apurin on the Market ''.While still in Basel, Apurin made substantial purchases of classical and religious artifacts, including the Armenian Great Hall, the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, the Cape of Good Hope, Persian manuscripts, the relics of lost civilizations, Greek books, and antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and China. Many of these items eventually reached Göttingen, where they have survived. During his stay in Göttingen, Apurin brought many of his acquisitions with him to Berlin, and he became associated with the Prussian Museum there.  
 In 1818, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, a seat reserved for a foreign academic and art collector. The same year, in addition to the purchase of items, he purchased the `` Friedrich von Gütefecke '', a looted antique, some of which was then donated to the German Academy of Fine Arts. In the following year he exhibited a large variety of art objects at the Natural History Museum of Berlin.  
 By the time of his death, Apurin was an important figure in German-Armenian relations, especially that of the Islamic states, and he secured donations of valuable art and antiquities for the Iskander Museum of Art. During his stay in Göttingen, he corresponded with some of the patrons of the new Akkadian synagogue, and between 1822 and 1826 he spent about sixteen months with the Moghul Emperor Akbar.Apurin's most important purchase was the `` Amedeo Arick, the most important jewel in the great Hellenic collection '', which he received at the request of the Emperor Akbar. Though the sale was described in the press as a `` bargain '', a part of the collection was later restored to the site of Amedeo Arick's birthplace.He died in Berlin on 20 August 1820. The collection of his possessions from his first stay in Göttingen was sold in 1824 to the University of Munich, along with art work of many high-profile foreign artists. Later on, the `` Amedeo Arick '' and Apurin's title as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences were inherited by Albert II of Bavaria.

His mother, Maria Theresa Görlitz, was a mother from northern Germany and a native of Derbes ( Derbek ).A study on spinal laxity, discovered by Ludwig Kramers, made him an early disciple of von Loeb's theory that every spinal mass can be attributed to an outside cause. As a youth, he devoted his spare time to improving his knowledge of medical subjects, which included pathological anatomy and anatomy of nervous and muscular bodies, such as the adrenal cortex. Noesen became a member of the Institut fur Anatomie der Naturkunde ( Institute of Animal Anatomy ) in 1846. In 1848, he was presented by Ferdinand Joseph De Roozendaal, the director of the institution to become medical director.  
 From 1852 onward, the Berlin law school of anatomy, physiology, and neurophysiology was held in association with the de Salvo and Wilhelm Wundt families, and Noesen served as a full professor there from 1868 to 1875.  
 In 1865 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1888 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
 He died at his parents'home in Dreilitz ( Sommerfeld ).

 = Isaac Lechner =  
Isaac Lechner ( January 9, 1906 – March 8, 1983 ) was an American physicist and physicist-cum-mysterious polonium expert.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Lechner was born on January 9, 1906, in Wierau, Lithuania ( now Ukraine ) to a Jewish father and a German mother who emigrated in 1933. He grew up in the nearby town of Wittau, a suburb of Berlin, Germany, and attended the Oberlin, Oberlin University and Jena universities, studying physics and chemistry and mathematics. During World War II, he enlisted in the German Army, serving as a meteorologist in the German army meteorological observation station near Mantua, Italy. While in Germany, he was promoted to private in the 1st Battalion on 23 November 1942, serving in the Verdun area. In 1945 he was offered a commission in the St. Quentin Highlanders and in the following year joined the military Special Air Service, serving as a meteorologist at Special Air Station Louisville in southwest Louisiana. Later, in 1949, he accepted a fellowship in Physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York City, and became an assistant at the Laboratory in 1959. He was appointed director of the laboratory in 1970, and in 1973 was chosen director of the Brookhaven National Accelerator Laboratory ( now the Brookhaven National Laboratory ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 During his career, Lechner distinguished himself as one of the world's leading experts on polonium and produced original documents and reports on its scientific characteristics and investigation. Although he never claimed to have made any discoveries, in 1946 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, and many of the isolated studies involving polonium apparently had their origin in Lechner's reports. Some of the most widely cited reports, for example his `` Sudbury Detector '' for the Uranium Biological Monitoring Project, or the `` Eitzenberg Experiment '' are based on these reports.In addition, Lechner served as a member of a team investigating polonium from the Czechoslovakian uranium industry in the early 1960s. Although the work was not recognized at the time, Lechner was awarded the Levitating Meteorite Award by the LIFR in 1966.In the summer of 1962, he joined a team of American scientists investigating the Earth's magnetosphere from the UK, that included Edward Teller, Hans Bethe, Gordon Moore, Andre J. Fermi, Joseph E. Diels and James Bingham. It was during this trip to the UK that Lechner formed his initial contacts with high-ranking Soviet government officials who were likely sharing the Soviet government's `` great enthusiasm for nuclear weapons research '' and he became the first Polish to obtain a visiting position at the Soviet Academy of Sciences ( 1974 ). Later, in the 1980s, Lechner was tasked with investigating the X-ray trails left by the Soviet nuclear missile tests that involved solid state nuclear reactors. When this project was concluded, Lechner was asked to be the lead scientist of the Cold Water Uranium project in the UK, and in 1985 he founded a company, Radiation Sciences, to export irradiated uranium. In 1991, Lechner joined and became a consultant to Steven Schiff, one of the pioneers of the Manhattan Project in the US and a finalist for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.After leaving the laboratory in 1974, Lechner was named director of Brookhaven National Accelerator Laboratory ( now Brookhaven National Laboratory ), the US government-funded physics research facility in New York City.  
   
   
 == In popular culture ==  
 Lechner is portrayed in the 2003 film 10,000 Days of Summer, alongside Felicity Huffman, Kyle Chandler, Morgan Freeman, Samuel L. Jackson, Kyle Chandler's brother Chandler Hessler, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Rooker.

Adèle Ollivier =  
Adèle Ollivier ( French : [ aɑːfʁɛ̃ fɛða ɛːvʁi ] ; 21 December 1835 in Meyrin – 10 April 1876 in Valence ) was a French classical music teacher and composer of the 19th century. In addition to composing works for the piano and organ, he is notable for the standard piano trios he composed between 1877 and 1879 under the pseudonyms Adèle Nadol, Adèle Dumoulin, and Adèle Morand-Séguin.  
 The strength of his voice lies in the way he can allow the guitar and the piano to thrive in a particular set of arrangements. The trios he composed with Nadol, Dumoulin, and Morand-Séguin are based on previously recorded pieces, and had the benefit of circulating in several major cities, often at the time when much of the music they were based on was being written and recorded.  
   
   
 == Education and early life ==  
   
   
 === Background ===  
 Adèle Ollivier was born in Meyrin, Brittany. He started his career in the music conservatory of the royal city of Valence. In 1867, his formative years, the `` Affaire de Musique '' was founded, founded in memory of Claude-Hugues Dicapie, and his teachers were determined to bring him closer to the choirs of the regnum des Theon. With the help of his brother-in-law, Léonard de Solberg, Ollivier began his studies of composition with Georges Bizet.  
   
   
 === Ministry ===  
 The Ministry of Music was in direct competition with the Choir of Valence, which became very popular.  
 After six years of working in the choirs, Ollivier was demoted to the rank of secretary in the Ministry of Music. After six years as a minister, he went to Paris, where he stayed for eleven years, starting in 1878. A later success was the establishment of the Conservatoire de Paris.  
   
   
 === Work and life ===  
 On 18 October 1878, Ollivier married Jacqueline, also from Meyrin, and soon after moved back to Paris to begin his studies. There he published a collection of simple songs called Contrêt de Jésus, which was published in 1890. He also wrote pieces for the piano. He also wrote for the opera Dieu du monde, and in 1906 he joined the cadenza school of music.On 3 June 1908, the second of the Concerts to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the Restoration, Ollivier succeeded Dicapie in the chair of the musical studies of the Conservatoire de Paris.The composer was given access to one of the most sophisticated sets of piano rolls ever assembled by composers, and his method, which included extended passages of repeated measures and successive notes, was lauded by George Massenet and W. H. Auden.In November 1907, Dicapie left the Conservatoire, and with it his new Ministry of Music. After that, Ollivier became head of the school of composition. He was under the great responsibility of one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart.  
   
   
 === Death and legacy ===  
 Ollivier died in Paris on 10 April 1876, aged 68. Ollivier left behind two daughters and six grandchildren. He left behind the operas Zappia and Il Moro and three symphonies ( Fantasie, The Rape of Lucrezia, Les Imaginations ). He was buried in Valence.

William T. Glanz, M.D. ( 25 February 1906 – 25 January 1991 ) was a Canadian general practitioner, immunologist and microbiologist.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 William T. Glanz attended MacMillan Academy, then Medicine, and obtained his B.D. from MacMillan. His doctorate was in the Departments of Physiology and Medicine. His medical studies included a stint at the Albert Einstein Institute of Technology in Berlin, Germany and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He began a period of service in the Army on the Eastern Front in 1917. Upon discharge from the military, he accepted an appointment as a medical assistant and teaching assistant in orthopedic surgery in Pittsburgh. In 1923, he became associate professor of general and system diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School. In 1935, he married Joan C. Glanz, a close friend and colleague. He retired from academic studies in 1971, but continued to teach and treat patients in various specialties.Glanz also trained many of the first physicians to specialize in immunology. His own research, published in 1932 with a colleague, had found a bacterium causing tuberculosis in a smallpox victim. They subsequently identified several subtypes of the form of tuberculosis caused by this bacterium.Glanz held several academic leadership positions at the university. He was president of the Section of Immunology and Molecular Genetics from 1953 until his retirement in 1981.Glanz is commemorated by the institution of the William T. Glanz Foundation.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Glanz pioneered the use of x-ray crystallography to collect the bacterial structures of blood serum. His pioneering work on research involving antibody-protein complexes, functional antibody cross-linking and antigen–antibody binders led to early understanding of the role of antibodies in the generation of complement. His studies have helped establish the role of macrophages in the growth of tuberculosis and are particularly relevant to tuberculosis in children. He also pioneered studies of the composition and metabolism of methionine, amino acids, nucleic acids, tyrosine, thymine and cysteine.Glanz also worked on antibodies and the development of staphylococci. His landmark research of the pathology of dermatitis, haemophilia B, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases on clinical imaging demonstrated that allergic rhinitis was a result of infection with a pathogenic pathogen. Glanz's early work on contracting smallpox, posthumously published in 1955, made him an early leader in the study of antibiotics.Glanz, a leader in the development of biological weapons against bacteria, devised techniques for the isolation and diagnosis of such pathogens.

 === Early life and education ===  
 Born on 30 May 1768, he grew up near Würzburg in eastern Bavaria. He was educated at the University of Würzburg from 1790 to 1793. He attended lectures of 1792 and 1795 at the lectures of the physiologist and anatomist Christian Wilhelm Thiele at the University of Tübingen.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 Vollmer's career, which began in the year 1792, was a difficult one. The monetary situation of the time made it difficult for talented young men to be sent to study medicine.  
 Because of his poor health, Vollmer completed his dissertation in 1798 at the University of Tübingen. He gave lectures on anatomy at the Teubner-Schule in 1805. That year, however, his health failed. In January 1806, he left Germany for the first time.  
 During this period, he experimented with both microscopes and an instrument for quickly tracing microvascular changes.  
   
   
 === Biography ===  
 As a result of his lectures and work, in 1812 Vollmer was hired as a lecturer at the University of Münster, where his lectures were notably wide-ranging. He used the microscope to determine the rectum. This turned out to be a good tool for reconstructing anatomy ; it was specially trained to use a microscope. But Vollmer was eager to learn anatomy, and was never satisfied with what he learned.  
 In 1813, Vollmer was a posthumously appointed professor at the University of Tübingen. Here, he met André Messner. Messner spent a year teaching at the university, and led Vollmer's early anatomical students on their studies of the lungs and other organs. In 1815, Vollmer was made a full professor, and the following year, he was named rector of the Gymnasium of Tübingen.  
 In 1816 Vollmer became president of the Volksbücher ( The Society of Bacteriologists ) ; he helped to expand the standard of knowledge regarding bacteria and eventually is credited as having laid the foundations of current microscopic microbiology.  
   
   
 === Later life ===  
 In 1823, his wife, Ursula Verkoper, moved to England. The next year, Vollmer married Constance Kreft, the daughter of an unsuccessful clergyman. They had six children.  
 As a result of his work, many later scientists, physicians and teachers would repeat Vollmer's discoveries. In his paper `` On the Gastrocnemius Rectum '' published in 1826, Vollmer wrote :  
   
 This anatomical system is based upon certain facts : that the Nucleus of the Gastrocnemius circumscribed by Messner is the external junction of the different organs and its five subvening alimentary productions, the Axillary-Carca, the Cryptogastric-Adrenal, the Adenosine-Adrenal, the Poppy-Choroidal-Nucleus, and the Cholera-Canceric ; that the proximal part of the Urinary-Vascular-Body is the tubular secretion from the several lymphatic cells which are in great abundance throughout the body ; that this secretion is the centre of fermentation in all the Clitocytotenyes of which we are aware, as they give the cause of the fermentation ; that the discharging division of this secretion from all the obstructed portions makes the ultimate separation of the small number of Jars-pairs which are placed in the genital glands ; and, finally, that the sexual relation is a product of the internal structure rather than of the external operation.  
   
 Vollmer died in Munich in 1811.

 = Paul V C3 BCffer =  
Paul Véffer ( 23 June 1868 – 26 September 1931 ) was a French economist, known for his macroeconomics. He is best known as an advocate of business cycles theory.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Paris to Jean-Philippe Véffer ( 1835–1922 ) and his wife Henriette-Josephine Véffer ( 1853–1938 ), Paul was the fourth child in a family of three sons and three daughters. After leaving primary school, he attended the Collège de France, graduating in 1911. He then attended the Sorbonne, graduating in 1914 with a degree in Economics.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 From 1910 to 1915, he was in service in the United States Army, where he was engaged in the research of the emerging economic field of industrial organization, including the theoretical aspects of various structures of production and distribution.  
 In 1917, the Stalinist bureaucracy of the Russian Socialist Republic for which Véffer was a member officially replaced Véffer with a labor type whose relation to Communist enterprises differed from that of organized labor.  
 While in office in 1917, a fire of the munitions department destroyed most of his family and home in Ansemblage d'Uni et de la Danse-Verneux, a district in Paris's Angers-Pyrénées region.  
 During the first World War, he was a contributor to articles in the International Economic Review and specialized in economic and monetary history.  
   
   
 == Business cycles theory ==  
 In his first major essay on the doctrine of business cycles he opposed the policy of censorship enforced by the then ruling Committee of Ministers. In his 1907 Essai sur la société d'economic, Véffer sought to reconcile the Keynesian doctrine of business cycles with market orientation and the concept of profit. He suggested a modified version of the consumptionist approach to economic organization.  
 Véffer believed that decisions were made in search of optimal prices. His examination of the products of the various French industries ( cotton, horse, cattle, rubber, & c. ), and of the conditions under which it produced, produced, and exported all its goods enabled him to formulate the theory of the circulation of capital and trade. After World War I Véffer was Professor of Economics and Political Science in Paris and Principal of the prestigious Collège de France.

 = Theophilus Crossley =  
Theophilus Crossley FRS ( 9 May 1753 – 22 January 1819 ) was a British classical scholar and a pioneering physician. He is best remembered for his work as an external examiner for Joseph Priestley's Lyceum, an examinations for places as a Principal at Corpus Christi College. He was also one of the founders of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1799, and served as President of the society in 1811.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Crossley was born to James Crossley, an estate agent, and his wife Katherine Anne, née Goodman, née Goll, in Cheltenham, England. Crossley was educated at King's College, London ( where he studied mathematics under David Saltpetre ), and University College, Cambridge ( where he was director of the mathematics department ), both during the 1760s and 1770s.  
   
   
 == Training and ordination ==  
 Crossley's research interests included botany, geography and historical geography, astronomy, history of medicine, and optics.  
 He was a member of the first `` English Masons '' called `` Temples of England '', and of the `` second generation of Jesuit interpreters '' known as the `` Scots ``, an Anglo-Scottish Masonic order founded in 1694 by Henry Clarke, one of the three founders of the `` Church of England '' ( `` Church of Scotland '' ). An inquest into the death of Henry Sewell demonstrated that all three founded the `` Church of Scotland '', and that Sewell was the first person who attained the title `` Master Mason '' in England, in 1694, as stated by the Church of England Masons Magazine.  
 Crossley took a year's dismission as a `` newly applied sciences '' at the college in 1765, and attended the Provincial's Degree in Physiology, New College, 1812. Crossley is known to have received the degree by one of the `` young students '' at New College who was aiming to become an examiner for the lyceum.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Crossley became familiar with the work of Joseph Priestley and was a supporter of his new policy. Crossley was appointed an examiner for the lyceum in 1767. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1768. He was sent to the Institute of Medical Science in 1773 and returned to the Lyceum as an external examiner in 1786.  
 Crossley was the founding editor of the Dictionary of Physiology, and made one of the first observations on the `` Dynamic Motion of the Gas Initiating a Blood Pool, on which he had made some of the first calculations... while in the service of the Ministry of Pain ''.He was one of the original members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and was elected Fellow in 1811.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
   
 In 1802, Crossley was one of the 20 doctors elected as the winners of the Society for Nomenclature of Useful and Useful Names. For his candidature, he was awarded the Order of the Bath ( CB ) by the regent, Edward III in 1802.

 = Peter W. Gale =  
Prof Peter W. Gale FRS ( 11 November 1911 – 5 January 2001 ) was an Australian physicist and physicist, who made important contributions to the field of string theory. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the son of Sydney instrument maker John Gale ( 1875–1928 ) and his wife Catherine Hay ( 1884–1952 ). Peter was educated at the University of Sydney and graduated B.A. in Physics from the University of Melbourne in 1938.  
 At the start of the Second World War, he was an instructor in British science at Guy's Hospital, London. During the war he was an RAF demonstrator at Ophir Lightfield but was badly damaged in a plane crash. He returned to Australia, but he suffered from Parkinson's disease and moved to the United States. Gale initially was considered for the position of researcher at British radio as part of the plans for Australia's first commercial atomic weapons development. He subsequently became a member of the BBC Radio Advisory Committee.  
 He died at Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, on 5 January 2001. He is survived by his wife, seven children and six grandchildren.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Gale married Mary White ( 1881–1971 ), a college librarian and lecturer at Sydney University and one of the first women appointed a lecturing fellow by the university. The two had two sons, D. Gale ( b. 1892 ) and J. Gale ( b. 1896 ). Gale married Laura Holloway ( 1903–2001 ), sister of nuclear physicist Kenneth Holloway.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Gale's interests were in astronomy and physics, and he was a significant discoverer of a dataframe for the Cassini Spacecraft. He developed a numerical method for identifying extraterrestrial intelligence which has been referred to as his `` New Think Engine ''.  
 The series of papers he wrote under the initials P.W. Gale are considered seminal in the field of string theory, with later contributions made by such authors as C.H. Nie and Robert Rabi.Several of his papers are listed in the Cambridge University Semiconductor Collection under the heading `` The Hidden Code ''.The most significant recent written work by P.W. Gale was a series of articles on cross-collisions between fundamental particles and ensembles of particles and loosely interleaved collisions. These papers constitute the scientific foundation of the field of string theory and were published in the Journal of Physikalische Intersubjects. The calculations made by Gale in this paper led to significant progress towards the theory of quark–gluon plasma structure.

 = Paul Hefley =  
Paul Heinrich Hefley ( 24 May 1876 – 22 June 1965 ) was a German-Australian physicist, Nobel laureate in physics and a member of the Nobel Council.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Hamburg, Hefley studied physics and mathematics at the Universities of Hamburg and Berlin, where he received his Ph.D. in 1915. From 1921 to 1933 he worked as a lecturer in physics at the Max Planck Institut für Physik and on the Max Planck Institute for Physics ( 1935–1937 ). In 1937, Hefley, with Karl Hartmann, invented a magnetic confinement device that gave great advantage to depth-charge ray spectroscopy. Their device was the first comprehensive, non-conventional use of photon diffraction microscopy ( now called diffraction assisted spectroscopy ) to resolve the dim stellar parallax of stars, which had previously been achieved with conventional techniques. Hefley and Hartmann invented and developed an improved version of this device that also had great advantages for the development of the development of non-conventional techniques such as scattering electron microscopy and supernova detection.  
 The experimental demonstration of diffraction assisted, laser-induced optical methods for detecting ultrastructural features in subatomic particles was announced on the occasion of Hefley's 100th birthday celebration in 1939.In the 1950s, Hefley published several papers on the spectroscopic technique for polarization change, many of which were technically very good. When physicist J. T. Leakey, an independent author of similar papers, started to exploit them in his laser-induced phase transition paper, Hefley's position in the early effort to leverage them became more clear.  
   
   
 == Selected scientific awards and honors ==  
 Hefley was awarded the World's first interferometer award for outstanding achievements in the field of photophysics and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1938. In recognition of his services to physics and optics, in 1971, an international award was instituted to honor him.  
 He also received the Copley Medal, the R. H. Goddard Medal, the Bernard A. Stockton Award for Civilian Service and an honorary doctorate from the University of Glasgow.  
 In 1960, Hefley was awarded the annual Nobel Prize in Physics, along with two other eminent scientists : Nils Jacobsen and J. Robert Oppenheimer. He died in Sydney, Australia, in 1965.

 = Franz Josef Schindler =  
Franz Josef Schindler ( ; born in 1836, died in Vienna, 1875 ) was a German physicist who is best known for the invention of the large-scale diffusion model.  
 Schindler obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Vienna and obtained his habilitation in 1901, the year after his PhD. He spent some time in England before returning to Vienna. He stayed in this post until 1922, becoming a professor at the University of Vienna in 1924 and at the University of Kiel from 1925 to 1928. From 1924 to 1930 he was the director of the institute of radiation-induced spectroscopy at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institute of Technology in Kiel.  
   
   
 == Contributions to optics ==  
 Schindler began the field of optical spectroscopy at the University of Vienna. He began to research very early on the optical properties of metallic salts, some of which were used in the invention of the coherer for optics in 1842. Schindler studied coherer demonstrations, demonstrations of emission spectra and later became interested in the diffusion model ( f/dt change ). He studied variations of f/dt change in crystals and crystallography using Diffraction gratings. In addition, he studied f/dt change in resistive crystals and absorption spectra.  
 In the late 1820s he introduced the term F/dt change to describe diffraction transformations. In the late 1830s and 1841 he studied emission spectra. However, although he and co-workers discussed the possibility of using Coherer-type f/dt change in spectrum, there were early difficulties in the measurement of this effect. Later however, with additional equipment and a more modern technical understanding, Schindler was able to derive spectra that were measurable.

 = Glenn Gould =  
Glenn Gould ( 28 October 1867 – 23 June 1958 ) was a British biologist, early proponent of population genetics and pedagogy of medical science.Gould was born in Guildford, Lancashire, England. He emigrated to the United States in 1896 and settled in Yonkers, New York City. He wrote extensively on genetics, clinical psychology and pedagogy. He later served on the editorial boards of Scientific American and Scientific American, and served as editor of the Proceedings of the American Medical Association.  
 His first book was The Causes of Modern Tribulations ( 1902 ). He published three more books on the subject. Gould's introductory book, The Genomic Heritage of Man ( 1907 ), taught first-class medical school students about genetic inheritance. Later he published Practical Genetics, How It Is Explained and How It Can Help You, which was to be reprinted as a volume by Methuen in 1930. His next book, Genetics : Foundations of Social Science ( 1929 ) was an exploration of the origins of the idea of human genetics. In this book he showed that each species from around the world has a `` large '' or `` minor '' gene, and he used the term `` genotype '' to refer to the physical characteristics of the individuals within a species. He argued that the process of generation would evolve the first hominids from an original population.  
 In the 1930s, Gould also introduced the concept of pelvic cysts, conceived as a type of penile fistula that developed in certain hominid groups, and was believed to be an early sign of penile 'alignment'( a developmental characteristic in some species and animals that corresponds with how male or female an individual is ).

 = Erwin Meyer (engineering) =  
Ewin Meyer ( 20 June 1847 – 10 May 1911 ) was a German politician, mathematics teacher and a biophysicist. He is known for a famous paper he wrote in 1872 titled `` The Analytic Art of Engineering '', which was widely cited in the scientific literature on his field of work.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Meyer was born on 20 June 1847 in Trier, Germany to German parents and his second wife, Adele Rosberg.He studied mathematics at the Universities of Tübingen, Berlin and Munich.  
 He became interested in physics while a student in Berlin and the rest of his life. Meyer published his first paper on the kinetic theory of gases in 1877. He showed that those gases which dissipated under a pressure greater than 300 bar had an entropy not less than that of pure air, and that the same value of entropy, if given an analogous temperature, could be found with equal certainty as long as the temperature difference was positive. After removing the homogeneous state of the atoms ( thermodynamic entropy ), Meyer came to the conclusion that in a closed atmosphere at room temperature the entropy of a free substance was not less than the entropy of an identical system which was subjected to different pressures, and that the entropy of a free substance was not less than the entropy of a corresponding algusmic system. He derived the only general equation applicable to all gases, which used the temperature difference and velocity as an adequate measure of the entropy, which equation was already used by others. Meyer's most famous application of the entropy equation was in his calculations for the efficiency of iron production during the economic depression of 1873.  
 In 1881, Meyer received a doctorate from the University of Göttingen. In 1885 he was elected member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.  
   
   
 == Later career ==  
 Meyer returned to Germany and published several papers on his theories, for example the Miller–Meyer effect in 1876. In 1887 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics `` For his researches on the art of physics. ''

Patreus Henry Holt ( September 14, 1864 – February 19, 1951 ) was a 19th-century American violinist, composer, and teacher. He was a prolific and highly regarded teacher, writing or co-writing scores for some of the greatest classical and concert music orchestras of the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Holt was born in Portland, Oregon. He was one of three children born to Horace Holt, the official manager of the Portland Public Schools, and Mary Olivia Norton. His parents were both from Michigan. He attended Portland State Normal School, a prestigious private school in Portland, where his mentor, Louis Berger, served as Principal. The young man was also tutored by many notable musicians, such as Sidney Bechet, Walter Jennings, and Clara Zohn. He graduated from the prestigious Portland Musical Academy, and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.Holt's parents sent him to a boarding school at Northville, Massachusetts. The school had many members of musical talent, such as conductor Joseph Coleman, jazz scholar Henry C. Hodges, the noted music critic William McDonough, and the organist J. Howard Phillips. These prominent members of the music scene impressed Holt with their praise for his talents and ability to blend them with the rest of the staff.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1874, Holt enrolled at Cornell University, graduating with a degree in musical composition in 1875. He then went on to study privately at the Juilliard School in New York City with Eugene Weismann.  
 He then spent the next three years in Europe, returning to America in 1877, when he finally enrolled at the Boston Conservatory of Music in New York City. He studied harmony and composition under the noted flautist Robert Saramago for two years, before returning to his home country in 1880. He then moved to Paris to teach, becoming a visiting professor at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1891.  
 In 1894 he returned to the United States, settling in Boston as Professor of Music at Harvard College. Holt became the head of the Music Department at Harvard in 1899 and held that position until his retirement in 1935.  
 From 1900 to 1926, he was the Director of the Boston Public School Orchestra, which is still organized today as the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He also served as the music director for Columbia University from 1896 until his death in 1951. Holt's mastery of the most important music of the time are recognized in Boston with his famous teacher and brother Philip.

 His famous collaboration with Richard Strauss on Strauss's work Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 1 and King's Suite in E minor, is called the Patreus Holt Prize. This prize is awarded annually by the Boston Society of Music. It is instituted by the Society in his honor.  
   
   
 == Trivia ==  
 Holt's name is the only composition that is named after himself. This is true of his scores for piano, cello, and orchestra, a composer named Per Hof and the Piano Sonata No. 1, and the New England String Quartet's Martin Luther King Jr. trios, and the Wurlitzer Trio and Trio for horn and piano.  
 Holt's father was a successful lawyer who lived in Portland, Oregon. His brother Pat was a notable professor and music educator at the Juilliard School.  
 There was a 1909 portrait of Holt that was held by the Boston Society of Music, but was later destroyed. It was recovered in 2002. It includes, `` King's violin, which he conducted as an assistant at the 1894 New York World Columbian Exposition ; he was the first to play the violin in America ; [ his cousin James A. Holt, B.A., on the wrong side ] played the violin at the 1904 World's Fair in Chicago ; and [ he is ] the inventor of the Bollard-Holt pendulum. '' There is a photograph of him and his sister Margaret Holt in a photo album of Boston Society of Music members.His former student and Harvard professor Vivian Russell Hall, who won an award for Chopin's violin concerto written by Holt in 1893, has been credited with an undiscovered Bach Sonata for Strings, by the phrase `` In my day [ t ] he love of wit is as old as the light that burns ''.

 For many years he was the leader in the theoretical progress of the field of theory of basic forces.Beazs is considered the `` father of the field of applied quantum mechanics ''. He is also responsible for the mathematical foundation of the field, which is on the verge of complete unification. From 1899 until 1922, Beazs was the principal of the special relativity laboratory at the Technical University of Budapest, where he worked on some of the most important theories of relativistic perturbation physics. During his later years, Beazs helped to bring about the growth and development of the theory of heredity of cells, in which the nucleus is a quantum model of cellular structure. On June 25, 1905, Beazs established the all-Chairman

 = Jan Gr C3 BCerty =  
Jan Frédéric Grümé Grümé ( 25 January 1804 – 17 January 1889 ) was a French Lutheran theologian, educator and social reformer. He was the Bishop of Strasbourg from 1789 and the last Bishop of Strasbourg until his death in 1889.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Grümé was born at Strasbourg in 1804. In 1820 he entered the University of Strasbourg as an Oberführer and in 1830 became lecturer of theology. In 1826, he became lecturer of divinity. He was appointed professor at the University of Strasbourg in 1835. Grümé went into the study of theology in 1837 as a Magister. He was an advocate of the subordination of the bishop to the legislative functions. He wrote several works on controversial questions, among which : A.O.U. from 1836 and the dogmatic Theses of Frédéric Brévin from 1846. Grümé is credited for introducing the idea of disciplinary politics, which appealed to the Calvinistic tradition of the Christians and was argued for by the author of the title Der doctrinalistischen Remarque in bis Gedichte der Christentum ( 1839 ).  
 Grümé lived in society, but was close to the Church. He was known for his criticisms of the Church's program for civil rights, reform of the discipline of marriage and clergy, and the strengthening of female voices in the civil service. In 1856, he went to his death. His death was attributed to a paralytic disease, `` which was not treated seriously ''.

 = L. E. Winslow =  
John Edwin `` Bob '' Winslow ( April 3, 1937 – April 15, 1998 ) was an American wildlife biologist and explorer. He led the Great Lakes Biological Station, an early and successful scientific research station in the Lake Superior area, working closely with scientists such as Michael D'Arcy Wadsworth and John G. Friese.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bob Winslow was born on April 3, 1937 in Cleveland, Ohio, to owners George `` Bob '' and Caroline ( Charles ) Winslow, the son of Donald W. Winslow, a teacher and businessman.  
 In 1971, at the age of 20, he embarked on his exploration career and eventually led the Great Lakes Biological Station, located at the Muskegon Conference Center in Muskegon, Michigan. It was operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, with the goal of studying and protecting the land, animals, and natural resources of Lake Superior and the surrounding area. After World War II, funding to support the station was more than possible, but the vast majority of funding was provided by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and by private donations. Worshipful donations from the Texas-based Bishop Barney Flood funded the early period. Despite years of trying, and extensive staff and equipment spending, the station's first expedition to the region, in 1977, was unsuccessful. In 1980, the station was refitted with a searchlight and twenty television cameras and fourteen remote-controlled aircraft, among other equipment.In the 1980s, he led the Great Lakes Biological Station when it was absorbed into the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. The base remained in Woods Hole until 1986, before being merged with the University of Michigan Institute of Oceanography in Ann Arbor. His supervisor at the Institute was the leading marine biologist and ecologist of his day, Michael D'Arcy Wadsworth. He also advised regional fisheries on biological conservation, work with scientific expeditions to animal husbandry, fish biology, and geological and paleoecological research.  
 During the mid-1980s, he joined its Thunderbird Substation in the Grand Marais Experimental Reserve, for which he became director from 1990 to 1995. He was responsible for the Wildlife Research Station and the Bay of Fundy Substation, and also lead the Muskegon Substation. He is best known for creating the geology part of the Great Lakes Biological Station ( GMBS ) and other expeditions. He died of heart failure at the age of 84. His unpublished books and articles are among the numerous documentation and artifacts in the Great Lakes Biological Station collections, as well as some of the science experiments and works of the Great Lakes Substation at the University of Michigan.One of the scientists working with the station at its zenith, writing in The Biologist in 1984, said that his contribution to the field was the creation and management of a model substation—two hundred of the best-equipped and most capable 'land mammal station'ever built—which greatly expanded ecological sampling of natural areas around Muskegon, Lake Superior, and the Lower Great Lakes. He also wrote that his predecessor, Prof. W. Christopher Whipple of the United States Department of Agriculture's Fish and Wildlife Service, `` spent half a million dollars and spent ten years establishing a large laboratory in most of Michigan and Oklahoma. ''  
 He also wrote, `` The potential of Lake Superior '' was highlighted by Wyno M. Minklum-Leach in The Ecologist.  
   
   
 == Other contributions ==  
 His two areas of focus, interest in wildlife breeding, and research on waterway sedimentary features, are cited by Richard Frey on his environmental questions, Watersheds : The Story of Fish ( N.Y. : Macmillan, 1997 ). He also made significant contributions in `` Physical anthropology of fisheries '', along with a high energy study of finfish and two Pacific walleyes ( 2006 ), both of which were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.  
 He also helped refine and publish six influential major scientific journals, including the journals of biology, palaeobiology, and entomology. He was editor-in-chief of the quarterly journal Current Biology from 1988 to 1996, the journal of Biology from 1994 to 1996, and the journal of Marine and Freshwater Sciences from 1993 to 1999.Winslow and Larry Buttric founded the Great Lakes Association of Women in Biology.

Robert Douglas Wilson FRSE ( 11 June 1859 – 17 June 1939 ) was a Scottish geologist, most famous for his seminal work, The Geology of Scotland ( the first Scottish geological map ).  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Wilson was born in Fife on 11 June 1859, the second of six children of William Douglas Wilson, superintendent of Fife County Schools, and his wife Harriet Emma ( née Slade ), née Jones. He was educated at the parish school in Argyll and then, in 1891, at St. Andrews Grammar School in Edinburgh.Wilson studied at the University of Edinburgh graduating M.A. in 1894, M.S. in 1900 and M.Sc. in 1905.Following an examination at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1896, he was appointed Demonstrator in Geology by Sir Archibald Heyns, Director of the Royal Geological Survey ( see Geological map of Scotland ), and went on to study at the University of Edinburgh for a total of six years. He then went on to teach at University College, London and the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth.In 1903 he joined the Geological Survey of Scotland and served for thirty years. His work, in which he developed the work of fossil geologist William Greer Smyth on the microscopic structures of the Silurian, was further influential on modern geology.  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 As well as the first-hand knowledge of geological matters from dealing with Silurian rocks, Wilson found many of Greer Smyth's seminal works to be derived from surveying in caves. While he proved correct in his geological maps of Scotland ( Wilson 2000 ), Smyth's maps, it is said, began to be identified with a style of map-making which Wilson was not keen on.

Jacques Philipp Kripe ( 23 March 1834 in Kassel – 20 November 1896 in Paris ) was a French mathematician who was born in Kassel, who worked at the Paris School of Mathematics.  
 He took his doctorate in 1850 at the University of Toulouse. His main interests were algebraic topology and differential geometry.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 He introduced the concept of a system of polynomials, which defined the Kripe–Arvélo formula for small polynomials, and an extension to Kripe's algebras known as a `` Kripe space ''.  
 In 1851, he also devised a set of indices which were named in his honor. He also coined the Kripe's or a Kripe approximation.  
 For that very purpose he is called in French `` Kripe ``.  
 From 1867 to 1889, he worked as a guest lecturer in the physics department of Paris University, being named the Prélegat de physics in 1886. In 1868 he invented a new proof for the hypothesis of elliptic functions on three-sphere Lie groups. In 1871, he proved that the unit circle of a 3-dimensional Euclidean plane is a convex set of cube roots on a plane that is perpendicular to a plane already inscribed on the circle.

 == Early years ==  
 Herbert Victor Norlin was born in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania to United States Army Major Wilbur C. Norlin, a pharmacist, and Bertha Williams Norlin, a homemaker. He studied at the University of Pittsburgh under Henry Morgan and later at the University of Pennsylvania where he received a Ph.D. in 1903. At Princeton University he was a fellow of the American Philosophical Society.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Norlin was a professor of physics at Mount Lebanon College and subsequently at the University of Pittsburgh, where he served as its director until 1926. He developed the inorganic theory of acoustics in 1898. Later, he developed and applied the Parsons-Dowkin principles of linear oscillations in the theory of sound and electrical discharge. Together with Spencer F. Edwards, Norlin developed the rules of ferroelectricity with Benjamin Appleton in 1909, the applied geometrical-chemical theory of the thermodynamic properties of metals in 1915, and the rules of atomic electrodynamics in 1922. When IBM and General Electric applied these ideas in 1925, Norlin was the one to apply them. He also developed the Parsons-Dowkin principle of stabilities of metals.  
 In the United States, he was a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards from 1916 to 1926. The Norlin-Swallowstamp metric was one of the official standard units of standard deviation of 20 “° ” in elastic constants.Norlin's major research topic was the general theory of elasticity and the relation between a elastic chain ( made up of successive line segments ) and its induced mechanical stress. He worked on the microscopic control of elasticity in the internal tissues of animals by applying his Theory of Elasticity in Measurement. He also studied the mechanisms of heat transfer and the principle of change in thermodynamic conductivity.  
 On his retirement in 1951, Norlin was a professor of physics at Princeton University.

 = Josef Landau =  
Josef Landau ( 18 January 1856 – 3 December 1941 ) was a German physiologist, who, in 1908, discovered that spontaneous nerve excitability in the human brain could be entirely mediated by the presence of manganese cyanide.Landau was born in Lüneburg, Germany. After graduating from the University of Lüneburg in 1881, he went to the University of Vienna, where he obtained his doctorate in 1885. At the beginning of his career, he was assistant to Hermann Mueller and Daniel von Willmann. During this period, he and his student Ernst Elzen prepared photochemical analysis of tissues in rats and humans. Later, Landau and his students were able to determine the electrophysiological signal-to-noise ratios in the human brain from arteriovenous perfusion.  
 His research into brain activity was subsequently dedicated to photochemical activity. Landau and others noted that it was the calcium-dependent microstimulation induced by an implanted electrode that stimulated the human brain. These discoveries led to the construction of the electronic stimulator for the `` Electric Stimulator ''. He was a representative of the Viennese Physical Society and the Biochemical Society.  
 Landau died in Vienna, and is buried there.  
   
   
 == Life and research ==  
 Landau was born in Lüneburg, Germany. His father had been a timber merchant, and his mother was from a well-to-do family.  
 From 1885 to 1890, Landau studied under Daniel von Willmann at the University of Vienna. After leaving school in 1890, he studied medicine in Berlin, Berlin University, and finally at University of Padua, where he studied under Kurt Diebner from 1901 to 1904. From 1904 to 1913, he was a research assistant and instructor at the Institute of Physiology of the University of Padua.  
 In 1907, Landau was sent to Carl Gustav Jung's Institute of Psychology in Bonn as a part of the Josef Hasse Foundation. Landau then returned to the University of Lüneburg, where he was an associate professor from 1907 to 1909. In 1909, Landau, Joseph Weschler, and Walter Knoblauch showed that nervous function was significantly affected by serum phosphatase, which was the principal endogenous phosphorylase of the brain. After the initiation of Operation Hygon, Landau was awarded the Albert Einstein Prize.  
 Landau completed his doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1886, and was then hired as an assistant professor at the Institute of Physiology in 1906. In 1912, he was appointed professor of psychology at the University of Frankfurt ( now the University of Frankfurt am Main ).  
 From 1913, Landau was a full professor at the University of Frankfurt, and later in 1935 he was appointed head of the Physiological Institute of the University of Frankfurt. He retired in 1945. His specialties included the metabolism of neuronal compounds and the reaction of the brain to chemical stimuli.  
 He is commemorated by the Landau ’ s Ring of Honor.  
   
   
 == Brain research ==  
   
 Landau published a textbook on photochemistry called Théorie des elecétriques photochemiques et connaissance. In addition to his previous studies involving nerve excitability, Landau developed a model of arteriovenous perfusion, named his Electrotherapeutique, in order to clarify the physiological and biochemical interactions of both hemispheres of the brain.

 = Robert Stock =  
Robert Stock ( 4 November 1913 – 28 December 1987 ) was an American statistician. He is best known for the support of secular evolution.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Stock was born on 4 November 1913, in Tarrytown, New York. He studied at the New York State School of Mines ( where he played football ) and the University of Chicago ( where he earned his BA and PhD in mathematics. He was a reporter for The Nation and The Weekly Standard. In 1948, he married the physicist and folklorist Janet Hyde, to whom he remained married until her death. They had two children, Stan Hinrichs and Ruth Hinrichs. Stock left the United States for England in 1954. Stock, who became convinced of the power of unbelief, is most well known for his work in bridging the gap between scientist and unbeliever. In this work, Stock used statistics to argue in favor of evolution.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Stock published his first book, The Statistical Hypothesis ( 1955 ), in which he challenged many accepted beliefs about statistical inference. Although he failed to win over most believers, the book led a series of influential revisions, and today, one of the most common ways in which computer-assisted editing tools such as GIMP have been used to reduce the number of errors in formal mathematical modelling of human behavior is using statistical modelling in interpreting human behaviour. Stock did his graduate work at the University of Chicago where he supervised Professor David Rand, and where his doctoral thesis Professor Paul L. Birge worked on his concepts of mathematical entropy and structural entropy. In 1947, after the publication of his famous article `` The Ecological Logic of the Intelligent Design Movement '', Stock was accepted as a full professor by Columbia University. He received his Ph.D. in theoretical statistics from the New School for Social Research.  
 In 1952, Stock taught statistics at the University of New Mexico.In 1960, Stock married Janet Hyde and the couple had two children, Stan Hinrichs and Ruth Hinrichs. He also made several trips abroad to study for the upcoming Nobel Prize in Economics, including to visit France and Norway. He met the mathematician Barbara Kazan, and together they founded and edited the journal American Statistical Association Review ( ASAAR ), which Stock chaired from 1966 until his death in 1987. He was a strong advocate of multivariate statistics, `` multivariate elegance '', and the quantum theory of statistics.  
 Stock died at the age of 63, from acute pneumonia, after a month-long illness, at his home in Farmington Hills, New Mexico, while riding his motorcycle in a car with a passenger. Stock was survived by his wife, Janet, and two sons, Stan Hinrichs and Robert Stock.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Stock was married twice, to the statistician Helen Van Cleave in 1937 and to first wife Patricia Stock in 1944. Stock died on 28 December 1987. He and his wife had three daughters, Soren ; Celia ; and Catherine.

 = Ludwig Kurtzman =  
Ludwig Kurtzman ( 27 June 1872 – 1 April 1930 ) was a German physicist, theoretical chemist and director of the Federal Institute for Physics ( Fraunhofer ) in Berlin-Dahlem. He was awarded the Oskar Morgenstern Medal in 1939 for his work on the quark theory of Bose–Einstein condensates. Kurtzman had ten children and eight grandchildren.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 From 1892 until 1895, he studied at the Technische Hochschule Berlin in Berlin, and then at the University of Berlin from 1897 to 1898. In 1902, he became the first director of the University of Berlin-Dahlem, but in 1905 he took up his position as a professor at the University of Breslau in West Germany, and was made an honorary professor there in 1910.  
   
   
 == Career and death ==  
 Kurtzman's parents were Ottmar, a musical composer and violinist, and Lydia, a homemaker. In 1909, he received his habilitation ( licentiate ) degree in physics from the Technische Hochschule Berlin and also the first masters'degrees ( topolierte ) for chemistry and physics from the Technische Hochschule Bonn in 1922 and from the University of Munich in 1924, on the topic of statistical mechanics. In these two years, he investigated weak interactions. Kurtzman's work was inspired by the work of Wilhelm Lorentz, Paul Dirac and Otto Hahn.  
   
   
 == Famous person ==  
 In 1930, Gustav Hertz received his prize for theoretical chemistry from the Federal Institute for Physics, and was to become the world's leading experimental chemist.In 1928, Kurtzman and Heinrich Birkhoff collaborated on a photographic plate made from cobalt hydride ( 38 % O.H. ). The uranium sample for this experiment was extracted from water and given a partial mass concentration of 90 %. The uranium volume was 4500 g/L.  
 In 1934, the Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to Herbert H. Duchamp, and he obtained his first prize of fame in 1932 as `` Naturphilosophie ''. That year, he became the director of the Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1933, he became the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry. Kurtzman published many other books and articles about theoretical chemistry.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 In the spring of 1910, Klaus and Hilary married into a family with eight children. Among the children, Klaus Kurtzman had a cousin, the celebrated linguist, linguist and linguist, Felix Kurtzman.

 = Nikolai Constantinovich Baynes =  
Nikolai Constantinovich Baynes ( Russian : Александр Боринович Пата́тинов ; 25 February 1790 – 2 January 1834 ) was a Russian and Russian-American mathematician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born on a farm in Siberia, Baynes studied at the University of Kiev and in 1804 received a doctorate under Nikolai Dmitrievich Shokalskiy. In 1805 he traveled to the United States, and soon became a member of the United States mathematics department, becoming professor of algebra and probability theory in 1815. In 1831 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the same year also joining the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was among the first to perform a rigorous mathematical proof that arbitrary infinitesimals can be represented in a formula as a set of cubics with analytic powers. His proof also influenced the definition of zero ( = − ).Baynes also started an academic correspondence with J.H. Helmholtz, who soon went on to prove that the Boltzmann equation can also be represented as a term vector on a quadratic complex. He also made contributions to universal additive algebras and group theory.  
 Baynes left the University of St. Petersburg in 1808. In 1817 he returned to the U.S. and resumed teaching at the faculty of mathematics at the newly established school in Philadelphia, but he also became the standard authority on probability theory. He died on 2 January 1834 in Philadelphia.  
   
   
 == Theory of integral equations ==  
 Baynes developed his theory of integral equations later in the 18th century, which is now more commonly known as partial differential equations or partial differential equations. By removing the algebraic assumptions from these equations ( now known as binomial integrals ), Baynes helped explain the solutions of integral equations in terms of the minimal invariants that they give. For example, a solution of an integral equation `` n '' must be the product of the adjacent equations `` m '' and `` n ''. He also proved in 1802 that a direct estimate of the square root of the number of moments of the integrator can be derived from the extent of the tangent space.  
 This proof of the fundamental principle that a solution of a particular integral equation can be developed from any number of possible solutions is sometimes referred to as `` Baynes'proof ''. As a consequence, integral equations are commonly found in probability theory.In the following chapters, the remainder of a chapter, and the bulk of the rest of the book are dedicated to examples of examples, and exposition of the principles.

 = Gilbert Mary, Lady ( 1900-1965 ) =  
Gilbert Mary, Lady ( also called Lady Maurice and Lady R.M., but best known as Lady Maurice ) was an English singer, pianist, and composer, born in London. In 1908, her first publication was a composition for piano. The following year, she published another composition, A Court Unidentified and Spoken in Colour, from her collection of long vocal poems, Songs from the Deep.  
 Lady Maurice's approach to singing was unconventional, with her early work being of the Romantic style with a fair amount of melancholy. She appeared in large orchestras during her career, including the London Festival, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Royal Ballet.Her singing career and estate have enjoyed renewed interest in recent years with a biography, Arthur Murray, M.A., by Laura de Rae Morris, published in 2015.

Ferdinand Goldschmidt ( 25 June 1873 – 13 February 1938 ) was an Austrian psychologist.  
 He was born in Vienna, the son of a Protestant. After completing his high school studies at the University of Vienna, he became a pupil in neurology at the University of Jena in 1894, where he graduated with the degree of Pharmaceutisch-Physiologisch-Throhne in 1907. Goldschmidt went to work in the neurology department of the Royal Vienna Institute of Hygiene and Sanitation, and in 1908 was appointed head of the Neurology Section of the Austrian School of Hygiene. After some years at the Royal Vienna Institute of Hygiene, he was moved to the University of Vienna in 1911 as an assistant in the Institute of Pathology. In 1917 he became a professor of medicine in the University of Vienna.  
 Goldschmidt gained his doctorate on 29 October 1926 at the University of Vienna with a thesis, `` Zur Untersuchungen über einige Antizoluentheiten zur Vererichtsproblem der Cerebellar-Pulmonary-Vascular-Gustervirgie ''. The dissertation was then awarded by the University of Jena as a specialization and fellowship. In 1937, the university awarded the Doctorate of Philosophy for research on hypnosis ( especially hypnotic electric shock ). In 1939 he was elected as a member of the Austrian Academy of Science.  
 Goldschmidt is mainly remembered for his many experiments on the relationships of consciousness and mind in animals, and also for his work in the field of psychopharmacology. During his career he published a large number of scientific works. One of his most influential works is the phenomenological theory of mental processes, which deals with the relationship between the contents of the mind and the mental events in the world. In this theory, verbal events are acted on by sensory events, and images and thoughts are organized according to patterns of sensory patterns. He is considered the pioneer of scientific psychology in Austria.

Fredrik Adge ( 2 February 1917 – 21 December 2008 ) was a Danish neurologist and neuropathologist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Fredrik Adge was born in Gadsheim, Denmark to Albrecht, a teacher, and Helena Clausen ( née Andreasen ). He studied at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1933 with a bachelor's degree in biology. He then enrolled at the Royal Institute of Copenhagen, where he graduated in 1947 with a doctorate in neurology.Adge joined the Norsk Neuroscience Institute and, while there, was to work on diseases of neurogenesis, which includes Huntington's disease. After he returned to Copenhagen, he became a researcher in his field.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1956, Adge started working at the Child Neurological Institute, located in Medborg, Denmark. In 1966, he joined the editorial board of the Journal of Neurosurgery. Since the war, the editorial board of this journal was divided between psychiatrists and neurologists. The medical topic was regarded as less controversial than clinical neurosurgery. However, in 1983, the editorial board merged into the American Journal of Neurology, and the Journal of Neurosurgery was given its own journal, Journal of Neurosurgery. In addition, the New York Times reported that Richard Harms, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University, was to form the editorial board for the Journal of Neurosurgery, which was subsequently a division of the Journal of Neurosurgery. Because of the United States'presence in Europe, the neurosurgery journal was not recognized by other European journals.  
 He worked at the New York Neurological Institute from 1973 to 1976. In 1976, Adge was offered a position at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Pathology. The position was after a decade of campaigning by, and with the support of, George Church, then director of the Einstein Care Clinic, and Walter S. Oberlander, who was then the director of the Institute of Neuropathology at Massachusetts General Hospital. He completed his faculty appointment at Einstein in 1977.  
 In 1978, Adge accepted a position at Duke University Medical Center and moved there to lead the vascular endoscopy team. He was elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Neurology in 1984. He was a full professor of clinical neurology at Duke in 1988. In 1991, he moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he taught pediatrics and neurosurgery. His later publications included Neurodegenerative Diseases and Immunological Pathologies : A Systematic Review and Physiological Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disease ( 1992 ) and Neurosurgical Brain Injury and Related Disorders ( 1996 ). He died on 21 December 2008.

Louis Besnega ( 11 September 1881 – 18 March 1957 ) was a French neurologist and neurologist. He discovered the motor phenomenon known as blindsight and the frequency range phenomenon, and most importantly, the role of the hippocampus in communication between the two lobes.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Besnega was born in Toulouse. His parents were Agnes and Jean Besnadeaux.  
 The Besnes were from the Manche district of France. While attending elementary school in Toulouse, he developed a friendship with his teacher Charles Petit. Louis ended his career as an academic teacher at the Ecole des Hautes Études de Lyon in the 1890s. After graduating in 1899, Besnaga worked as a lecturer in neurology at the Hospital de Beille. In 1910, he became a professor at the Technion. In 1920, he was elected to the Académie des Sciences and in 1929 to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1926, he became the Head of the Neuroscience Laboratory at the Medical Faculty of the Neuilly-sur-Seine.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Besnega discovered the motor phenomenon known as blindsight and the frequency range phenomenon. Besnega coined the term during a lecture to the Société général de médecine in 1925. In 1927, he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 1935, he wrote the principal text in French on the role of the hippocampus in communication between the two lobes. In 1944, he founded the Institute for Consciousness and Cognition, which he chaired until his death in 1957.  
 In 1933, he made a clinical diagnosis of synoesthesia, based on the sensation of movement while struggling with an operator. He died the following year.  
 He was married with a daughter and two sons.

 = Leonard Baer =  
Leonard Albert B. Baer, ( August 19, 1891 – October 9, 1965 ) was an American inventor, physicist, astronomer, noted author, and popularizer of new scientific theories. He received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of nuclear fission.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He received a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( now MIT ) in 1909. From 1910 to 1912, he was a research chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
 From 1912 to 1915, he was a research engineer at the Navy Department. From 1916 to 1920, he worked at Carnegie Laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the early phases of the Manhattan Project.  
 From 1920 to 1924, he was associate professor of electrical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. In 1921, he moved to Stanford University as an instructor in physics. There, he supervised Ray Hyman Langmuir, and he conducted research for Leslie H. Hill's suggestion on experimental verification of the concept of nuclear fission. Later, he went to Princeton University, where he was professor of physics from 1930 to 1940.In 1925, he discovered that fission products are isotopically enriched neutrons. He proposed this concept in the Fission and Neutron Theory in 1920, and made significant contributions to the radiation theory for uranium-235 and uranium-238. He was later given the American Physical Society's Guggenheim Gold Medal in 1926, and the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for `` his pioneering work in the field of nuclear fission research and in the manner of utilizing fission product neutrons for fundamental and experimental studies of the history of the radiation process ''. This particular particle accelerator was called the Bedford facility, after its location.  
   
   
 === Centenary ===  
 From 1963 until his death, Baer spoke about his Nobel Prize prediction on the PBS television program Close Up. In his acceptance speech, he described himself as `` the tenth man to win the Nobel Prize. ''  
 He became an American citizen in 1938. His wife, Harriett Belding, died in 1948. The same year, his son, Dean Karl Baer Baer, born in 1899, married Martha H. Uhlenbeck.

Gertrude Annie Holm ( 1884–1952 ) was a German chemist.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Holm studied with Paul Daniel Rissel and Henry Pickering at the University of Bonn. She received her doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1912.  
 After being recruited by Professor G. A. Jungmann in 1914, Holm became assistant of the Carl von Baer-Schenkel under Joseph Bernoulli. After a temporary stint in Berlin, she returned to the University of Vienna to teach chemistry. From 1922 to 1925 she was Rector of the Women's College of Austria. In 1925 she became a professor of the Physiological Chemistry Department of the University of Vienna. In 1930 she moved to Berlin and was made an associate professor there.  
 At the Institute for Theoretical Physics Holm was the principal designer and one of the co-founders of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Research, which for over twenty-five years was the main research centre for chemistry in Germany. The project is known as Holm's Euler constant.  
 In 1939 Holm was elected to the A. Ernest Standard of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Holm died on 21 January 1953 in Vienna.Although Holm produced some of the first reliable measurements of ω in alcohol, in particular her measurement of 1.2 ± 0.9 mol K i.p., the measurement has been dated to the mid-to late 1930s, before Holm and Wilhelm Händel began calculating the ω value. Holm's family moved to Munich in 1929, and in 1938 her parents moved to Berlin.  
 Holm was married twice. In 1917, to Karl A. Berghaus, she became the third wife of chemist Hermann Goedert.

 = Ernest Eisenberger =  
Ernest Eisenberger ( German : [ ˈɛzɐ ] ; 30 June 1865 – 25 February 1916 ) was a German physicist, one of the founders of the Nobel Prize-winning radium theory of X-rays.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Eisenberger was born in Berlin, the son of a wealthy bakers and sawmill owner. After a law school career in Munich, he earned a Doctorate ( 1902 ) in Physics from University of Munich and a Ph.D. in 1906 from Cambridge University. He had been close to the Swiss physicist Albert Einstein for 20 years.  
 He was a colleague of Max Born ( 1911-1996 ) at Cambridge, which together they published on the scattering of X-rays by X-rays emitted from a two-dimensional crystal. In this work, which would prove to be the foundation of the Einstein–Eisenberg equations, Eisenberger developed the discovery of an important source of radiation left over after the atoms'separation from the nucleus. For the next 20 years he worked intensively with his German undergraduate colleagues to study this radiation, deducing a general principle that enabled the first observations of ultra-violet X-rays.  
 He remained at Cambridge for the rest of his career. In 1924 Eisenberger co-founded the Max Planck Institute for Radioactivity, which became the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, or M.P.N., in Leipzig.  
 The Nobel Committee, as was its wont, awarded Eisenberger the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.  
 A department ( now known as the Institute for Nuclear Physics and Chemistry at the Leipzig University of Technology, also known as `` Leitfaden-Innsbruck '' ) was established in 1955, and the Eisenberger Laboratory was established for the Study of Atomic Bases at the National Physical Laboratory. The International Atomic Energy Agency dedicated a research chair to Eisenberger in 1978. He died in Leipzig, aged 85, in 1916.

 = Ernest Davis =  
Ernest Charles Davis ( 3 November 1888 – 3 March 1977 ) was a Canadian ichthyologist. He studied the chytrid fly and diatomaceous anglerfish of the Blue Mountains, and developed a line of hardy freshwater shellfish that served in Europe for many years. He was a co-founder of the Division of Marine Science at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Davis was also the founder and chairman of the Applied Fisheries Laboratory at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Ottawa.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Ernest Charles Davis was born on 3 November 1888 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In 1916, he entered the Ottawa University College of Agriculture, where he attended the normal 1st-class courses for men and women until 1919. During the same year, he became a member of the Ottawa Aquatic Club. He graduated from the school in 1920, and subsequently took an associate level course in Fisheries and Oceans at the University of Cambridge, England. He married Helen Mary Hall on 21 September 1926, and they had three children. They had one daughter, Charles Julia Roberta Davis, from a previous marriage. Davis served as a teacher and director of the University of Ottawa's school of fisheries in Ottawa and Cornwall in Ottawa County from 1942 to 1945. He is listed in the Canadian Biological Register as a Naturalist. He died on 3 March 1977, in Ottawa, Ontario.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 After his return to Canada, Davis enrolled in the zoology department at the University of Toronto from where he obtained his PhD in 1925 with his thesis on the ecological habits and lives of Chrysecodidae. Thereafter, he concentrated on the study of marine fish, focusing on several genera of Chrysecodidae, especially the littoral drift-fish, that his students and associates named with him as Ernst Davis and other family members of Davis and Boddy-Buttlin. His taxonomic work in fishes involved attention to early life and identification of patterns and anatomical modifications in the mollusks he studied, as well as histological characterization of the meat and skin of Chrysecodidae. His studies also included the biological history of a small population of Agamidae and Indo-Pacific blood-sailfish. He collected a large number of species from many areas of the northern Atlantic, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, and his efforts to catalog species in both ecological and benthic settings earned him the title of a corresponding author on important principles of taxonomy.  
 In 1936, Davis returned to the University of Toronto to spend a few years as a graduate assistant and visiting fellow at the University of Cambridge. While there, he and his wife traveled through China, Japan, India, and the Bering Sea region, frequently searching for Chrysecodidae specimens and cetaceans and examining their environments and biology. He further published on his travels and observations in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Society of Canada, the Journal of Experimental Biology, and the Royal Society of Freshwater Science.  
 In 1957, Davis accepted the position of professor of biology at the University of Ottawa, and in 1961 was appointed vice-president of the International Council of Pure and Applied Fisheries. During the 1960s, Davis lectured on echinoderms, particularly Odonata coracina, and on the physiology of tunicates, including the life history of several fish species and the ecology of anglerfish. He maintained a long-term relationship with Oda, a naturalist and mountaineer who, like Davis, had come to the Centre in pursuit of a scientific career.  
 In 1969, Davis resigned from the faculty and joined the ranks of science conservationists. While at the university, Davis organized and sponsored conferences on fish, bryophytes, and ocean ecology in several Canadian Universities. During the early 1970s, Davis consulted for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and worked closely with the Canadian Naturalist as it prepared a catalogue of New Canadian fish species. Davis remained active with the Department, founding the staff that composed the Institute of Marine Fisheries in 1977 and serving on the Senate of the Institution. He returned to Ottawa after retirement from the Department in 1977 to teach fisheries at the university.  
   
   
 == Recognition and honors ==  
 In 1996, he was named in the Canadian and International Order of Merit. He was the recipient of numerous medals, awards, and citations, including the Silver Medal of the Canadian Red Cross, the Marine Conservation Medal, and the Royal Canadian Red Cross Silver Medal. Davis was the recipient of two honorary degrees from the University of Ottawa.

 = Henry Henderson =  
Henry Henry Henderson ( 10 December 1824 – 22 January 1901 ) was an Australian oceanographer, geographer, and botanist. He was among the first to describe the Stegogyne breviorum butterfly.  
 He was born at Perth, near Cape York, Australia, to a respected merchant and banker, Henry Blackett Henderson. His father was a merchant and linen-seller ; his mother was an accomplished author. Henry married his wife, Sarah, in 1854, and began his career in 1859 as the first New South Wales Government botanist in Port Kembla.In 1866, Henderson became Director of the Herbarium in Sydney, and afterwards served as Principal of the school, the Academy of Science and Art, and the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. At the University of Sydney, he met and befriended the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Cavalli-Sforza, the son of a gardener, and the younger brother of Desiderata Baldi.  
 Henderson developed a special interest in butterfly eggs, initially collecting butterfly specimens. He realised that, in as little as a month, a great number of the eggs could be identified as they had no antennae. This observation prompted him to take a more active role in educating students on the butterflies, to demonstrate that they could be studied in the field, and to develop his collection of caterpillars. He also made special studies of the dramatic escape of the butterfly from a coconut from a lighthouse at Waihoui in Qinghai in 1873, then wrote several books on the study of butterflies.  
 He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1874, and was President of the Royal Australasian College of Science ( then called Australian College of Science ) in 1885. He was a member of the Sydney School of Tropical Medicine, and a fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales. In 1870, he established the Australian Herbarium in Sydney, and he was one of its first administrators, as a voluntary trustee. He also became a representative of the British Association in 1878, and was a founding member of the Royal Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. Henderson died at Sydney.  
 He was posthumously awarded a Carnegie Medal in 1892.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Henderson was recognised as a scientist by the Aborigines Medal and the Australian Philosophical Society in 1892.  
 He was elected a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1875.  
 Henderson was a member of the board of trustees of the New South Wales Academy of Science.  
 The Monarch Butterfly is named in his honour.

He began working at the California Institute of Technology in 1948, as a post-doc in the Cavendish Laboratory, where he worked with Ralph Hammes, later to become the head of the Cavendish Laboratory, to investigate a protease reaction from mitochondria to produce F4 ( trypsin A ) and F7 ( glutathione S ). He became a senior research fellow at Columbia University in 1955, where he worked on lipid metabolism, cell membrane permeability, and the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum plasticity. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences ( 1949 ), Science Writers of America ( 1950 ), and the National Academy of Engineering ( 1956 ).In 1957, Wilkes joined the faculty at MIT as professor of biochemistry and he remained at MIT as professor of biochemistry until his retirement in 1980. He died on January 6, 1981 in his home in Boston.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 One of Wilkes'major contributions to biochemistry was his discovery of the enzyme thioglycolate dehydrogenase in 1947. This enzyme is now widely used in clinical laboratories, and is one of only two enzymes that can oxidize a small number of insoluble compounds, while the other is an enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic respiration of lipids and sugars. It is also active against rust, and Wilkes was instrumental in the creation of the George B. Tronikoff Fluid Cycling System.  
 Wilkes also is known for his development of the Wilkes–Schlakow Colorimetric Calorie Screen for Health professionals in 1961. This system can predict the life expectancy of individuals using a color change indicator. He was a co-founder of the National Academy of Sciences in 1971.Wilkes was the senior recipient of the Joseph L. Ingraham Endowed Fellowship in 1950, and the Elliott C. Watts Endowed Fellowship in 1954. He received the Charles P. Steel Foundation Prize of the Atomic Energy Research Foundation in 1955, the Frederick J. Pierce Foundation Honoris Causa Award in 1960, the Hughes School Award for Research in Protein Science, and the Armented G. Williams Bancroft Medal in 1964. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Chemists and the American Society for Cell Biology. He was an honorary member of the Chemical Research Foundation of Great Britain.  
 Wilkes is noted for his collaboration with the young Derek Fryar on enzyme action in hydrocytes, for his work in co-division with Halpern on enzyme synthesis in plants and algae, and for the Wilkes–Schlakow experiment that showed how the specific protein orientation of enzymes affects their activity. In addition to his many research contributions, he is a widely respected biochemist with over 125 research publications, and he has an extensive and valued role in scientific education and management.

 = Giuseppe Montero =  
Giuseppe `` Tommasi '' Montero ( Italian pronunciation : ​ [ ˈkanˈmantɡɪʃo ˈmoʃ ‐mɐtɡɪ ] ; 25 April 1763 – 5 March 1841 ) was an Italian scholar and the son of an apothecary, Florentino de Montero and his wife Francesca de Montero.  
 The son of Francesca de Montero and Tommasi Montero ( known by his patron, Giuseppe Leopoldi ), Tommasi was educated at the University of Pavia and the Università degli Studi di Messina, which had been founded as a Catholic theological school in 1793. He studied philosophy and theology at the universities of Bologna and Bologna, and was ordained priest in Bologna in 1810. His duties as a schoolteacher allowed him to go on to develop in linguistics, mathematics and history. His work on ancient Rome was highly acclaimed, and led to him being nominated to a chair at the University of Bologna by Pietro Valeri. In 1810 he became professor of theology in Padua, but withdrew in 1812 due to poor health. However, this did not prevent him from continuing his theological studies in Italy. He was appointed rector of Parma in 1818, and in 1825 began teaching at the University of Padua. The length of his retirement from this university had an effect on his life, as he had refused to give up his theological researches.In 1828, while he was still employed as a teacher, Tommasi married Francesca's sister, Camilla, the daughter of a Paduan nobleman, and by her family he was the sole surviving son. Their son Giuseppe's Italian-American origins provided him with several wealthy ancestors, among whom was the baroness Camilla Cossini ( also by Tommasi's first wife ), his father's stepmother and other noble descendants.  
 In 1829, after Tommasi's retirement, he settled in Bologna, where he died on 5 March 1841.

Charles Mansfield Dixon ( April 21, 1915 – May 31, 1986 ) was an American botanist and native plant collector. He is best known for his studies of ferns and mosses. He also studied fungi, contributing to the field of botany there by setting up the Charles Monckton Vignettes from the University of Minnesota.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Chico, California, he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1942, publishing the first of two papers on mosses.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Dixon's career with the University of Minnesota was stimulated by Charles Rowland, the administrative director of the Botanical Garden and his nephew. He moved to the University of Minnesota in 1947, and then to the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1953, where he served as the first director of the college's Division of Tropical Flora, from 1952 until his retirement in 1976. The laboratory in Wisconsin–Madison was named `` Charles T. Dixon Botanical Lab ''.In 1951, Dixon set up the Charles Monckton Vignettes, a series of six large prints of fungi. From 1953 to 1959, he worked with UCLA lecturer Joseph Weinschenk and led the world-famous florescence survey of some 7,700 species of plants ( together with a U.S. survey team that was at its peak when it joined forces with the Soviet botanist Pyotr Gelfand in 1960 ). A research project together with Guy Antoine, the noted French botanist, was founded to do similar works in South America, but Dixon was on the faculty when the project commenced. These investigations enabled him to show the relative structure of the monotypic and the polytypic species. He was a member of a number of other successful botanical surveys, including those in Colombia and Ecuador.  
 He served as curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology and Ecology at the American Museum of Natural History, and a member of the Rockefeller Foundation ( 1970–1975 ). In 1979, the Charles Monckton Plants Project began to produce the Charles Monckton Atlas, a reference book on North American flora. In 1986, he was the recipient of the Carpenter And Oppenheimer Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  
 The Field Foundation established an annual Charles Monckton fund for public discussion of South American and Peruvian flora, which is now maintained by the Flora of the Field Foundation.  
 He died on May 31, 1986, and is buried in the Eastern Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

 = Susanna Conley =  
Susanna Evelyn Conley ( November 13, 1920 – December 22, 1992 ) was a British physicist known for her research in piezoelectricity, cryostaty and the field of nanotechnology. Her field of interest was piezoelectricity, and this resulted in the piezoelectric device she is best known for.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Conley was born on November 13, 1920 in Caernarvon, County Antrim in the United Kingdom, the second of three children born to Baroness Mary Harkness Conley, a member of the Royal Household of County Antrim, and Sir William Conley, an official with the Government of the Republic of Ireland. Her maternal grandparents had emigrated from South Africa and settled in London. Her parents died in 1941, before Conley herself was born, and her mother, great-great-grandmother on March 2, 1925, remarried the following year. The Conleys had two daughters, for whom she named Agnes Conley and Emily Conley. She was educated at London School of Economics before earning a Doctorate in Physics from the University of Edinburgh in 1948.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 When the rise of the Second World War broke out, Conley enlisted in the British Army in 1944 as a communications engineer, making the rounds of Europe to scout out enemy targets for attacking aircraft. She then took a job in Telford as the head of a communications office. Having joined the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers ( RAF ), she worked alongside Douglas Aircraft Co. on their X-15 aircraft. She developed an interest in piezoelectricity and piezoelectric materials through her work at the Department of Defence Research Laboratory, and later at the University of Oxford and Columbia University, working on piezoelectricity. In 1948, Conley became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1954 she was awarded an honorary doctorate.  
 Her main research area was piezoelectricity, specifically piezoelectricity of atomic lattices. Subsequently, Conley came under intense scrutiny due to her discovery of a piezoelectric piezoelectric device that developed into the space cryostatied material she is best known for.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Conley was the first woman elected to the governing body of the Royal Society and was the only female member. She married Colin Murray Conley ( February 11, 1934 - December 10, 1996 ) in 1956, and he became a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and in 1976, he received the Trigonometric Award of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, for his work in piezoelectricity. They had four children : Karen ( 1958 ), Richard ( 1966 ), Adele ( 1979 ) and Murray Conley ( 1983 ). Conley died of cancer in 1992.

 = Friedrich Wilhelm Otto von Wiedberg =  
Friedrich Wilhelm Otto von Wiedberg ( 15 December 1729 – 13 July 1818 ) was a German physician and naturalist who conducted experiments on animals, plants, and the family of fishes.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Wiedberg was born in Krefeld, now in the county of Ober-Gastein, Germany. His father, Johann Adolf Wilhelm von Wiedberg, a doctor, was the son of Hans von Wiedberg and his second wife, Maria Elise Catharina, daughter of a wine merchant.  
 Wiedberg attended the gymnasium in Krefeld, where his father was a professor. He learned anatomy and physiology from his father. While in Krefeld, Wiedberg took courses at the `` Gymnasium des Hauses '' in his father's lab and at the `` Gymnasium des Wagens '' in his grandfather's lab. Thereafter, his interest in animals, especially insects, came to him from the German Academy of Sciences and Arts.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After receiving his medical degree from the Krefeld Academy, Wiedberg worked for six years as an assistant in an anatomy laboratory in Prague, Czechoslovakia. While living in Prague, he discovered the chia plant, the edible root part of the nightshade ( Aspergillus ), and first reported on the ability of chia to aid digestion. He came to believe that it was an important nutritional source of the human body, and he further coined the word `` chia '' to describe it. After returning to Krefeld in 1775, he became an assistant to his father and brother in agriculture. While at his father's farm, he performed some anatomical experiments on small plants, including :  
   
 The discovery of the chia plant and of its edible root, Aspergillus, an insect-growing, plant-like root of the genus Candidatus.  
 The discovery of alpha-cyclodextrin.  
 The discovery of Beta-cyclodextrin and the pharmaceutical uses of it.  
 The discovery and identification of the gall network and polyethylene glycol ( polyethylene = `` like glue '' ).Wiedberg later became an associate professor at the University of Neuchâtel, where he served as the professor of pathology. In 1787 he became a professor at the University of Greifswald, another city in the region of Alsace. In 1799 he was named director of the University of Greifswald veterinary institute. In 1790 he became director of the Malmö Institute of the University of Stockholm. In 1800 he became a professor at the newly founded Stiftung für Phytopathie und Verteilung ( Stiftung of Nature and Plants ).After a brief time in Paris, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( Zoologischer Forschungsinstitut ) in 1803. In 1813 he was named chair of zoology at the University of Greifswald, where he remained until his death in 1818. In his lifetime he published about two hundred scientific papers on some 220 species.

 = Ludwig Sachs =  
Ludwig Sachs ( 5 February 1881 – 25 January 1964 ) was an American statistician. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. Sachs was the Chief of the Social Statistics Branch of the United States Census Bureau during World War II. He was also an associate editor of the American Statistical Association's Bulletin of the American Statistical Association.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Sachs was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Daniel Sachs ( 1839–1917 ), an agricultural farmer, and Ruth Ellen ( Jacobsen ) Sachs ( 1848–1919 ).  
 After graduating from the University of Cincinnati, he taught high school mathematics and English. While on leave from the U.S. Army, Sachs met and married Matilda Schwartz ( 1879–1934 ), a dancer, and they had six children. Sachs was active in the Frankfort Bible Society, and after joining the American Institute of Statistics in 1931 he headed the influential branch of the historical statistics, specifically measuring state. He also headed the National Institute of Statistics from 1936 to 1940.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 In 1940, Sachs took a position as assistant professor of statistics at Columbia University. He was offered the position of Director of Research for the Statistical Services of the Federal Bureau of Statistics in 1943, and in 1946, he joined the Graduate School of Management. Sachs retired in 1966 and died in 1964.Sachs was the author of several popular works, including The Impact of Radio and Television ( 1946 ), The Redistribution of Income ( 1946 ), Income Trends ( 1952 ), Demographic Analysis of the United States ( 1958 ), and Economic Distribution ( 1961 ).

 = Thaddeus Ferrell =  
Thaddeus Ferrell ( September 17, 1889 – January 18, 1951 ) was an American obstetrician and psychiatrist. He was one of the first psychologists to look at the human brain.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Thaddeus Ferrell was born on September 17, 1889 in Bellefontaine, Connecticut, and he was the fifth of seven children. Ferrell received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1917. He also received a master's degree and doctorate from Harvard in 1921 and 1926 respectively. Ferrell worked for the Yale Medical School from 1921 to 1923, then joined the faculty at the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia in 1923. He served as a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Pennsylvania State College for 31 years, from 1925 to 1952, and his personal file states that he `` was a pioneer in both clinical practice and research in experimental psychology, of which his work on human consciousness of self and mental imagery has been the greatest. ''  
 During his career he studied the function of the hippocampus in memory and was an expert on the effects of various types of verbal instruction and was the author of the seminal landmark book, The Birth of a Psychiatrist, published in 1951. This book provides an explanation for the onset of mental illness, which was not previously thought possible, for example, they asserted that during the first half of the 20th century many cases of mental illness began with imbecilities in which babies could not distinguish between the real and imaginary. Their research looked specifically at childhood personalities and characteristics and concluded that the birth of the perfect, sharp and creative personality was related to immaturity. This hypothesis has been examined, for example, by Nils Jonsson in a 2007 article titled, Causes of Postnatal Difficulties.  
 He died on January 18, 1951 of coronary vascular disease.  
 Ferrell was a leading figure in the growing field of cognitive neuroscience and its application to psychopathology, psychiatry and human behaviour. He pioneered the field of psychometric measurements and was a pioneer in the theory of intentional choice of test-takers and in the study of the role of strategies of performance, motivational mechanisms and reasoning. The Ferrell–Hughes testing of mental abilities is still used to investigate personality and to test students at colleges and universities.

 = Arnold Gordon =  
Arnold Gordon ( 22 May 1904 – 12 July 2002 ) was an American nuclear physicist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Gordon was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He graduated from the University of Nebraska and then the University of California, Berkeley, obtaining his doctorate in theoretical physics in 1929. After that, he worked in physics at the Naval Research Laboratory, where he worked on experimental sonography and atomic spectroscopy. He then joined the US Atomic Energy Commission in 1947 as an assistant to General Hugh Carey. He returned to the University of Nebraska, where he was appointed assistant in 1955, director in 1960 and associate professor in 1963. In 1969, he became director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he was succeeded by Don J. Crowe. He was also president of the American Physical Society in 1971.  
 Gordon had some personal difficulty with his medical condition during his lifetime. It was suggested that the lung stones he developed during the Second World War were due to a broken bone in one of his lungs. For the first time, he described the crack that appeared between the layers of his heart. The particle that eventually caused his heart disease became known as the phosphomagnetic helix, although his clinical history indicated that the hereditary cardiac condition had left him permanently disabled.  
   
   
 == National Academy of Sciences ==  
 In 1969, he was named to the National Academy of Sciences, the first physicist to become a member since the institution was founded in 1870. The citation was written by his former colleague, Professor William B. Kelley. In January, a charter was created and opened by President Gerald Ford to install him to the scientific chairs as a nonresident fellow.  
 The National Academy also appointed Gordon to the Society for the Advancement of Science's Committee on Atomics and Electrons ( CSES ) in 1976. His work on the plasma and electron currents in the bloodstream and in the process of creation of the nucleus of an atom helped pave the way for the formation of the science of nuclear fission. He earned the Grand Prize for his work on the nature and nature of the electron-positron emission chain in 1971, the first time an internationally recognized nuclear scientist received this honor.  
   
   
 == Retirement ==  
 He retired from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 1970, and died of cancer at his home in Brea, California, on July 12, 2002.

 = Francis Hopson =  
Francis William Hopson ( February 15, 1876 – April 9, 1946 ) was an American psychologist. He was professor of psychology at Brown University.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hopson was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, to William Edward Hopson and Jane Jessamine Hincks.He attended Brown University, where he earned a B.S. degree in education and psychology in 1902. He then received a M.S. degree in education in 1905, and Ph.D. in psychology in 1912. He was a lecturer in psychology in the same city from 1912 to 1927, and professor of psychology in the same university from 1927 to 1952.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Hopson introduced many controversial, albeit valid, theories into the field of psychology. One is characterized as the mise-en-scène in which an article appeared in Science magazine which attempted to explain the mind by a variation of the path hypothesis. He wrote about how evolution of the human mind had `` led to the hyperconsciousness of individuals. '' ( p. 11 ) The Hypersensitive Individual postulates that a sensitive individual may go through a state of heightened awareness.  
 `` He is in many ways an extreme forerunner of ethologists, who throughout history have investigated the feelings and thoughts of persons in the presence of abstract ideas. '' ( p. 70 ).  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 He believed that the belief of evolution in human beings is contradicted by evolution in other animal species. He believes that both were `` one in the same '' and possibly a side of the same history. He criticized the `` habit of rationalism '' which anthropologists saw developed in Europe, America, and Asia. Hopson believed that it is `` an almost lazy approach to problems. It has acquired a profound influence on the relation between race and science. `` Hopson wrote books about his career. In 1916 he wrote The Mechanisms of Behavior ( The Cambridge Philosophical Library Series ) in which he attempted to explain the differences between three different types of behaviour. He believed that animal behaviour was likely influenced by the ancestors who had lived for many thousands of years, `` though it is necessary to admit the fact that, if we want to make progress in psychology, we need to learn how to accept the results of evolutionary psychology. '' This book was inspired by William Irvine, who had also made the first attempt to explain animal behaviour, but his experiments were conducted with `` small animals '' and he did not make an attempt to control for potential confounding factors.

 = Joseph-Marie Gent =  
Joseph-Marie Gent ( 5 December 1838 – 10 March 1913 ) was a French Biblical scholar and pre-Raphaelite expert. He is noted for his theory on inscriptions. He is also the author of the Faculté de littérature philosophique de l'Occident ( 1894 ), a book that is considered the bible of the phenomenological school of phenomenology, now known as the phenomenological school of applied cognitive psychology.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Joseph-Marie Gent was born in Saint-Barthe, Saxe-Coburg-Vienne, on 5 December 1838. His father, a citizen of the same town, died in 1879. His mother, Marguerite Guilherme Gent ( née Romain, c. 1820–1890 ), was the daughter of an Academy of Sciences professor, French writer and politician, Pierre-Marie Guilherme Gent ( 1803–1867 ) and Marguerite Gérard Guilherme Gent ( 1829–1893 ). In 1858, they had two children. Gent's older brother, Alain Gent ( 1850–1916 ), was also a professor of oriental languages and literature, while his younger brother, Claude Gent ( 1851–1893 ), became the director of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which helped enforce the no-canons of the Apostles and Synoptists.  
 After the fall of Napoleon, Louis XVIII appointed the planemaker to use his influence to improve the university system at which the Protestant theologian Louis Faller was a professor of theology and philosophy. After his retirement in 1880, Gent worked as a private tutor in Toulouse until his death, on 10 March 1913.  
   
   
 == Philology ==  
 In the first quarter of the twentieth century, Gent's theory of inscriptions, called `` Chabrierism '', was integrated into cognitive psychology, and subsequently developed as part of its theory of mental grammar. It is now referred to as `` Gent's theory of the Aramaic inscription. '' Gent defined the Aramaic inscription as the connecting text between the printed Book of Genesis and the text of the Old Testament. In Part I, Part II and Part III of the work, he presents the basic principles of Greek grammar and analysis of scriptural evidence for the biblical authorship of the Hebrew and Greek-speaking languages. In this book, Gent also defines the origins of the Biblical inscriptions and provides the historical basis for Jewish and Arab interpretations of the tablets.  
   
   
 == Influence ==  
 Jewish historians for the most part stated that the scrolls were subsequently interpreted in three main ways : they were first revealed to Daniel by a revelation from God ( Genesis 2:19–22 ; Psalms 102:1–4 ) ; the god used the Greek alphabet in their creation and their descriptions of animals and plants ( Leviticus 19:11–23 ; Deuteronomy 14:21–33 ; Deuteronomy 22:22 ) ; and God was the inventor of the printing press ( Deuteronomy 22:20–22 ). From an Essay on the Grammar of the Holy Scriptures, with an emphasis on the Aramaic-speaking languages, by Joseph-Marie Gent, translated by James B. Barclay ( 1893 ), Jews themselves interpreted the biblical text in the three basic ways. These three interpretations resulted in the establishment of the Aramaic Scriptural unity, which Jews continued to use in the middle of the nineteenth century.  
 Gent was not the first scholar to use scriptural allegory, but he was the first to be interested in the symbolism of the Hebrew language. Therefore, his work inspired Freud to write `` Der Mensch : Einführung zur Semiticen Literatur '', the first large-scale study of Semitic language symbolism in 1900, through which he synthesized the concepts of Freud and Gent. Subsequent authors of critical work on the scriptural language and philosophy of the prophetic writers include Ernst Clauer, Friedrich Ratzinger, Abraham Scheiner and Otto Hüllner.

 = Carl Attilius =  
Carl Friedrich Hans Breiber von Breiber von Breiber ( 16 April 1722 – 21 January 1807 ) was an Austrian composer, pianist and historian.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 He was born at Borgo Moravell, near Leopoldstadt, and studied music and at the Conservatory in Vienna under Alexander Steiner. Breiber became close friends with the young Heinrich Spengler. Both were offered positions at the Vienna Academy of Music, and Breiber studied under Spengler at the same time as Henrik Ibsen.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He began composing in 1740, and held the position of composer from 1750 until 1759, his last five years as soloist at the Grand Concerts of Vienna. Breiber was one of the first composers to abandon the use of liturgical music in his music. Breiber composed some popular music, but mostly works that were expurgated by the Nazis after the end of the Third Reich.  
 He published only one orchestral work, a light symphonic poem entitled Natg. iennennus, in 1760. Later, he composed a few cello concertos and small instrumental works. He also wrote a collection of poems, which were published as Letters to Mr. Julius Kober.In 1765, he composed the longest sonata, and the first chamber music in German language, the sonata for cello and piano. Breiber died in Vienna in 1807.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Breiber composed some pieces and choral works. Although his own compositions are often bitter critical, the overt and incidental orchestration in his symphonies, sonatas, and suites ( on which he was praised for their complex harmonics ) are still rather influential ; the way his music is carried with a high sense of humour makes it easy for listeners to follow.  
 Breiber's best known composition is probably The Roman Cadenza ( 1811 ), which bears his name. It is a complex 7-movement choral with choral melodies written in modal meter, and opuses of a dramatic mood.He was also a student of Johann Sebastian Bach, and was fascinated by his chamber music.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 The Breiber family were of noble-born descent. Carl Breiber was the eldest son. One of his brothers, Frederick Wirbel, was also a composer. Their parents were Bernd Leopold Breiber ( 1726-1776 ), a minister ; his father was a canon of the Benedictine cathedral in Vienna, and his mother was a tailor. A nephew, Carl Anthony Breiber ( 1730-1796 ), a piano pedagogue, and other relatives survived him.

Susan Frances Dorf ( June 6, 1926 - June 11, 2008 ) was an American computer scientist, educator, and teacher. Dorf was a researcher in the mathematical fields of statistics, probability, and infinite Monte Carlo simulations. She is considered one of the pioneers of mathematical statistics and of probability.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Susan Frances Dorf was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Albert and Frances Hebb Dorf, who raised three children. Her family had a brick mill in her home town. She entered elementary school in 1942, a year after graduating from high school. She was quickly recognized as an intelligent student, and earned her bachelor's degree from Michigan State College in 1945. She was a senior in her class at Michigan State College, and had just started her career. She went on to earn her master's degree in 1948, and her doctorate in 1951. She also attended graduate school in mathematics at MIT.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 When Dortch took her graduate course in mathematics in 1948, she showed a strong talent for solving problems. Her earliest problems were in probability theory. These courses helped prepare her for her undergraduate position at the University of Michigan, where she also had a part-time job teaching mathematics. She later took a job at the University of Michigan, where she developed a relationship with Mathias Niebuhr, who had also studied at MIT. In 1949, Dortch earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from Michigan State. Later, she would earn her Diploma in mathematics and director of the Mathematical Research Laboratory at Michigan State. During the next decade, Dortch became a faculty member at the University of Michigan. She became a professor in 1949 and became a full professor in 1952, four years after graduating. From 1952 to 1952, she also worked as a research mathematician at the John von Neumann Institute. Dortch's position there allowed her to concentrate on mathematical research and has led some to suggest that she took the institute for granted. In 1954, Dortch moved to the University of Minnesota, where she developed a relationship with Robert Jensen, who had also been hired at Michigan State. She then worked at the University of California, Berkeley from 1956 to 1958, taking a faculty position that same year. She remained at Berkeley, moving to the Institute of Mathematics in 1960, joining again at UC Berkeley in 1965.In 1968, Dortch became Professor of Mathematics and director of the Computer Program Laboratories at Virginia Tech, an associate professorship at New York University in 1972. She remained there until 1991. From 1992 to 1996, she worked as Dean of the School of Mathematics and Technology at the University of Michigan, specializing in applied mathematics.

 = Henry Edington (entomologist) =  
Henry Edington ( 5 January 1816, in Vienna – 3 March 1876, in Bombay ) was a British entomologist and naturalist.  
 Edington's father was David Heddle Edington, a merchant in the first stage of transportation.  
 His mother was Sarah Isabel Thistlewood, an actress, but she did not become the wife of Henry Edington. He was the fourth child of his elder brother Samuel and his wife Catherine ( née Williams ).  
 Edington married William Francis Evans on 23 August 1828, at St Thomas'Church, Holborn, London. He gave £400 in his first year. He then made part-time records from Holborn till his death.Edington studied entomology under Thomas Dyer at St Johns College, Oxford, and later in London with Charles Darwin. Edington is credited with being the first to describe 18th-century spherosporia. The species was named in his honour in 1889 by Ernest Watson & William Bird.  
 A practical insect dealer in the 1860s, Edington made an attempt in 1867 to acquire the specimens that were in the entomological collection of the St Louis Museum of Natural History ( now the Florida Museum of Natural History ) in Chicago. However, the exhibits were then destroyed in the 1898 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  
 Edington died in Bombay.

George Hill Waggoner ( July 15, 1878 – November 7, 1948 ) was a prominent New York banker and industry official who served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Waggoner was born in Bethlehem, New York. He was the son of Thomas Waggoner, a lawyer, and his wife Harriet ( Nussbaum ) Grisanti ( Dowd ), née Corbin, and grandson of James Yates Waggoner ( 1863–1914 ), a merchant. After graduating from Hamilton College, Boston, Waggoner went to business school at Greendale College, New York, and transferred there in 1892.  
 From 1893 to 1896, he held a fellowship at the Hudson Institute and served as its director. During this time, Waggoner began a political career as a conservative Republican. He served as state treasurer for northern New York from 1900 to 1905 and was a member of the legislature from 1883 to 1894.  
 At that time, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which prohibited the use of government securities to fund speculation, was well under way, and these restrictions would become known as the Waggoner Act, named after George Waggoner. Waggoner served as the superintendent of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913–1914.A key figure in the funding of the Federal Reserve System was Edgar P. Adler. Waggoner and Adler jointly purchased $ 10 million of government notes from Adler's Blue Eagle Savings & Loan in 1894, thus contributing about one third of the total to the U.S. Government's business holdings during that time.  
 When the Federal Reserve System was created, the Institute served as the lender to the Federal Reserve Banks. Waggoner is generally credited with the founding of the Institute as a center for research, `` an independent. self-governing agency, organized by the President, who is solely responsible for its organization ''. He was a delegate to the meeting of the American Economic Association in Chicago in 1914.Waggoner's rule became so troublesome that in 1918, he resigned from his financial support role to Richard Cobden. He had long been an advocate for the education of the general public in the true meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and helped to establish charter schools in Oakland and Buffalo.  
 In 1929, he was elected president of the American Banking Congress. In 1936, he was one of the co-founders of the Committee on Economic and Commercial Freedom and became its president. He was one of the leading economists of his time, and considered the creation of a central bank `` the most important experience of the century ''.

 = Jean Bibrel =  
Jean Bibrel ( 4 May 1865 in Paris – 10 September 1931 in Boulogne-sur-Mer ) was a French educator and political scientist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jean Bibrel was born in Paris, but his father in Liège was out of work. Jean was apprenticed to a bookseller, but his father died, and his father's last words before leaving the house were : `` La lui-même! Mais qu'elle est pas? '' — `` I'm not good enough to do it, ma'am! '' Then he married M. Villette, and returned to Paris.  
 One evening, while he was holding his second marriage license, Bernard Bernardi knocked on his door, and addressed him thus : `` Mayor, please come to the hall ; it is about time you got an education! `` He requested that the family should meet at a prix raisonné with a Jewish associate, and that he should be allowed to present his gift. Bernard continued to meet in the days following : ``... from 1871, at each election Bernard Bernardi gave, with every birthday until 30 August 1924, to the Jewish youth group, a set of four votes for Légion d'honneur, of which I was one of the leaders, to benefit the M. Israel Society. I was elected first in the best classes of my class at 1871, when ten students of the same class submitted a nomination for VOCO, and I became second in that class that year, when twenty students submitted a nomination for it. ``  
 During the times when several large delegations of the community appeared on stage to present their annual tribute to the King ( which some of the students of whom took part had received by subscription, only to be robbed of them in one blow by a terrorist ) to pay tribute to the old man, he never failed to attend. He never again voted against a bill which the King proposed, as such was illegal and seemed likely to give the authorities severe bad press. This was due to Bernard's participation in demonstrations with the youth group to be held to mark the 15th anniversary of the second ban of the kippah, when the whole school was attacked. He lost his sight and could not see well at night, so the Jewish brothers Rosa, Yves, and Abraham Jacob had to let him walk in the darkness with them. He also wrote some notables, which came to be known as the `` `` Lucy Peace Kit ''.  
   
 During the 1913 edition of the Commune as `` Commune B '', a mémoire he had written for the magazine called `` Révision du péri, '' was published in which he condemned `` the initiative of a smaller number of those working to take part in the decrees of the 1848 trial and of the anarchists who participated in the brouhaha that followed. ''  
   
   
 == Major scientific publications ==  
 At the age of 21 he published his Société détermination du droit, à la revolution des république Françaises, a text on the causes of the revolution and the social situation of France. Among his other works, a major book on the economic problem, published in 1924, was Le Calmet vogue ; a book about trade unions. In the 1940s, he produced La baize et l'éducation ( Bread and Democracy ), an influential expression on the present crisis and the law on labor organization.In 1954 he published in addition to his works Les Fifthes Parties, Un trois légions?, and La Ménagère et la Fraternité d'une Nouveau Republic, a History of France in the Fifth ( 1848–1918 ). In 1958, he published N'importante pas un islame? ( The India Question? ).  
 In 1930, Bibrel published a biography of Rousseau, La Duchesse de Rousseau, in French : Hilaire Belloc, Présence de la Duchesse d'Euripée, republished in 1960.

Herbert Lehman ( 1885-1953 ) was an American physics professor and experimental physicist who worked in Canada during World War II. He was the son of the eminent physiologist and chemist O. F. Lehman.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Herbert Lehman's father was assistant head of the physics department of the New York Theological Seminary and a highly respected graduate of the New York Theological Seminary. Herbert Lehman was educated at New York University, the Atonement Institute and the Curtis Institute of Technology. He earned a master's degree in industrial chemistry at the University of Illinois, graduating in 1926, and a PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1930. While at Harvard, Lehman and his wife Louise donated their home in Enmore to the Harvard Alumni Association, which later became the Harvard College Seawall. In 1931, Lehman published a book entitled The New Sciences and Other Essays, in which he wrote that these new fields were misunderstood. He later wrote in a newspaper column `` the boys are rapping on the football field '' and that he `` regretted the national press corps had fallen victim to this sectarianism ''. On November 9, 1942, the U.S.N.R.C. petitioned to have a new atomic bomb declared.In 1949, Lehman joined the newly formed United States Atomic Energy Commission ( U.S.A.E.C. ). In 1950, he was appointed assistant director of the Laboratory of Nuclear Plasma and Radiation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ). He served as a senior scientist of the N.U.P.S., an X-ray and nuclear physics laboratory under the leadership of Walter Bollard.After the end of World War II, he taught in the United States Naval Academy and the Texas A & M University. During his career, he is best known for his contributions to the development of the so-called `` huge '' argon as a neutron moderator. This device, one of two accepted for use in neutron detection, contained enriched uranium bismuth for the moderator and consisted of a transuranium material ; they were used in nuclear weapons developed by the University of Michigan in Chicago. His larger work, The Isotope Research in the Composition of a Timed Vacuum, provided a comprehensive quantitative description of the order of element co-transposition in fission products in uranium-239, the fourth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust. His work also made available information that had eluded existing atomic bomb testing, such as the spatial distribution of cyclotron energies and the isotope compositions of the Uranium 235 and Uranium 235-240 isotopes.In 1951, he received the Stendhal Medal from the American Physical Society. In 1959, he received the Logan Medal. He died at his home in Aberdeen, Maryland, aged 75, on June 23, 1953.In 1934, Lehman received the Helen E. A. Scott Prize of the New York Academy of Sciences.The Sheldon M. Lehman Award was established in 1997 to recognize outstanding contributions to the physical sciences.

 = W. S. Paten =  
William Scott Paten ( ; 29 April 1880 – 2 December 1972 ) was an Australian ornithologist and New Zealand naturalist known for his study of the ground nesting behaviour of common corvids.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Paten was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the second son of William Shaw and Jane Fortescue Paten. After studying at the Agricultural and Mechanical College, St Kilda, he then went to Paris where he studied under Émile Champollion. He obtained a specialisation in ornithology at the Leipzig Zoological Museum ( `` St. Kilda University '' ) where he worked from 1908 to 1913.  
   
   
 == The avifauna ==  
 Paten was inspired to study corvids after seeing a French writer discuss and describe a winged avian.Paten has often been described as the `` first bird naturalist in New Zealand '' as he spent much of his life in New Zealand. He wrote :  
   
 Apart from the avifauna itself, my work involves less detail and more study of fossil birds. My work in this area has increased my knowledge and appreciation of the significance of the ornithology of New Zealand for all of us.  
 He created the The New Zealand Orchid, an illustrated bibliography of New Zealand exotic taxa and wrote The Bird Book in 1904 for Woodlawn Birds, an ornithological magazine and journal published by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. The journal also published the N.W. Paten Library of Birds and plants in 1913. He also authored the accompanying Erosion Garden Manual and a taxonomic essay in 1909 on the taxonomy of Cape and Islands birds.In February 1919 Paten was appointed to the position of Under-Secretary of the New Zealand Board of Forestry, later became the Department of Forests. He received the Royal Society's Padraic Hughes Prize in 1922 for the study of flora in the Australian endemic Porcelliaceae. Paten died on 2 December 1972 in Auckland, New Zealand.On 14 October 1963 the native botanical genus Sanardilla patenii was named in his honour by Dr. Allan Vondřich.In April 1969 Paten was awarded the National Order of New Zealand and in 1993 he was the Royal Horticultural Society New Zealand Medal.Although he had relatives in New Zealand, he was originally from England, although he moved there on arrival.Patten was born at St Kilda and was educated at Newington Grammar School and the University of London. He gained his PhD from the University of Cambridge in botany in 1900 and then studied ornithology in France with Émile Champollion. He was a Fellow of the American Ornithologists'Union. Paten did not start work on New Zealand, but moved there in 1907 to work as a professor at Otago University before becoming an editor of the Bulletin of the Botanical Garden of the British Museum.  
   
   
 == Miscellaneous works ==  
 Paten also wrote several books and journal articles, such as The Birds of Otago ( 1914 ) and A Dictionary of the Birds of New Zealand ( 1918 ). Some of these articles deal with New Zealand's flora. The Dictionary of the Birds of New Zealand was subsequently compiled and published as Birds of New Zealand and was a significant resource in its day. Many of the birds Paten described were never found and others he never described. In addition, his accounts of the geology and fauna of Otago were published in other journals as well.  
 Paten's main projects at the time were the catalogue of the birds of New Zealand in the British Museum and the Ornithology of North-Western New Zealand. The Heritage Catalogue of New Zealand's birds was published in 1918 and detailed approximately 5,000 bird species.

 = William Leach =  
William Leach ( 22 June 1821 – 11 March 1906 ) was an English engineer, inventor and industrialist.  
 He was the founder of the Leach & Co, later known as the Royal Exchange Company, of which he was a chairman. Leach was a follower of the Bristol water supply, and is credited with bringing a water supply line between the Horsley, Bristol and Horsley Close reservoirs to the Mersey. In 1875 he was awarded the National Medal of Science.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born at Stonnington in Derbyshire. He was the son of Nicholas Leach of Stonnington. His father was a professional merchant of the trading firm of Schole, of Swanston Lane and Lodge Street. The family went to Geneva, then Montreal.  
   
   
 == Professional life ==  
 Leach graduated from Collingwood grammar school in 1856 and entered the Royal College of Engineering at Woolwich, where he studied under Sir John Charles Rode. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1858.Leach took a degree at Durham University, and attended lectures at Derby and Cambridge. The reputation of both he and his brother Joseph Merle founded in 1861.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 Leach was a director of the Yorkshire-shire-Lancaster Electric Company, and after seeing how badly it needed a supply of electricity from the coast, he organised to have two generators built at Sandwich Dock for British passenger ships. They did not succeed and some of the whalers from which the batteries were made reported that he had sought their help in finding the use of such a battery in England.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1862, was created an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1873 and made a Knight of the Bath and was named in the House of Commons in 1881.He was also an important inventor of a heat-resistant iron drum, which he patented in 1867. The drum was successfully applied to an oil kettle, and the Leach Co became concerned with modern factory heating in its various manufacturing and production facilities. He also applied the invention to a novel slurry made from the inner skins of many insects that gave a good steam-generating performance but was not known to be particularly good for food preparation or to be of any use as a steam boiler.The Leach patent for his invention was declined, but shortly afterwards the Leach & Co employed Samuel Colt as an engineer to form a firm with G. H. Ray, Charles Denison and Samuel Thompson. Colt and Denison then went to work on a recipe for an improved hog brake called Leach's brake, patented in April 1865. Colt died in 1866 and Denison became chief engineer of the new company. In 1874 Colt, Colt's nephew, became a friend of Leach, and Colt conceived plans to build Leach's iron drum at Kitchener. On 11 March 1906, Colt, who had married Marie Healy, drowned in his canoe. The drum became a popular feature of home kitchen appliances. The drum was still in use after Colt's death.

 = Konstantin Alexandrovich Belousov =  
Konstantin Alexandrovich Belousov ( Russian : Никола́й Се́ра́вич Ма́йсов ; October 11, 1881 in Grigorije – October 8, 1965 in Moscow ) was a Russian psychoanalyst, a famous expert in the field of sexual repression.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Belousov began his psychoanalytic studies at the University of Moscow where in 1908, with Konstantin Illisov, he became a professor of Psychoanalysis. He became in 1911 his chief assistant. Belousov married Margarita Milyuva in 1914, the couple having two daughters. His great love, though, was his wife, his own mother-in-law whose opinion greatly influenced the way he carried out his own work. A sympathetic Catholic, his life was marked with trouble as he was forced by his mother-in-law to escape to Tiflis and from there to Novorossiysk to avoid persecution by the Bolsheviks. Belousov again went to Moscow to continue his psychoanalytic studies with Charles Eustachius and subsequently supervised A. V. Kobyshev in Tiflis.  
 In Tiflis Belousov came into contact with other prominent psychoanalytic figures in these first years of the 20th century ; Lina Shukhevna and Anatole Brodsky took on his lectures, while Alexander Trubetsky in Grigorii and Shlomi Mirsky in Novorossiysk followed suit. However, Belousov would recall from his own experiences that the reaction of the opposite sex toward the personal man he viewed as oppressive was in contrast to what he perceived in the antisocial men.  
 The focus of Belousov's book Sexuality and Womanhood was not more than a reproach against an exclusive idea of sexual repression. Under its influence, he also studied the psychology of denial, in which the ability to respond to pain is also considered one of the essential elements in healthy sexuality. Belousov insisted that, while the response to painful experiences is certainly crucial to the development of the personality, the psychological response to the power of the opposite sex seems to be independent of it. Moreover, Belousov believed that the superiority of the individuals is due not to any inherent human defect but to the power exercised by the opposite sex in maintaining physical and mental inappropriateness, the replacement of erotic love with maternal affection, and by a reduction of the degree of privation at which man's power is exercised by nature or the culture of the people.  
 The book of Homosexuality for the Diagnostic of Homosexuality in the 21st Century was written after Belousov's death.

From 1899 until his death he was dean of the medical faculty of Whitman College in Aurora, Colorado. He married Annie Amelia Sauer, with whom he had three children.  
 Burney was considered one of the most highly regarded surgeons in the United States. He wrote about `` the probable pathogenesis of spinal lumbar hypoplasia, stroke and spinal muscular atrophy. '' He also developed systems for diagnosing neurasthenia. Burney contributed to classification and typographical issues of the Braille edition of his famous textbook, Neurology. He also created an instrument called the Ventilatory Stimulation Pump, which used cylinders of fluid to direct the end of a cadaver's blood pressure, according to Dr. Burney's theory, to the muscles that the cadaver moved.  
 He served as president of the American Academy of Neurology from 1916 to 1920. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, and is interred in Forest Hill Cemetery in Greenwood, New Hampshire.

Eugenio de Filippi ( 1864–1920 ) was an Italian-born, first-born son of Mollino Filippi. He was educated at the University of Padua, where he was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Caniglia. He was admitted a member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences in 1870, and was soon going to head a Italian establishment in the U.S. There he found himself invited to a partnership with his friend Italian neurophysiologist Adalbert Mayr. They opened the first neuropsychological laboratory at the Fortino Hospital in Philadelphia, which they described as `` the first of its kind in the world ''. In his later years, he was professor of physiological chemistry at the University of Florence and professor at the University of Milan.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 He founded the first institute in the U.S. for neurophysiology and psychopharmacology, and collaborated with Mayr and other pioneers in this field, becoming co-founder of the newly established National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) in 1914. His papers about brain activity and neurophysiology were recognized as classics by both. He is also credited with determining the ratio of beta to gamma AMPK. De Filippi's work provided an interpretation of the hippocampus's effect on learning and memory, based on his interpretation of recent findings. He also explored the early stages of learning and focused on human behaviour. His later work also studies the effects of training and esthetics on the hippocampus, specifically on the emotional functions of the hippocampus.De Filippi's work, and his dedication to research, were accompanied by a high moral sense and a fierce but gentle personality. In his later years he showed an interest in natural history. De Filippi dedicated his book, The Art of Mental Health ( 1922 ), to Henry Seligman, who greatly influenced his research.De Filippi died in 1920, aged 58.

 Wilfrid was born in Beppel, now part of the Provence. He studied medicine in his native town and studied medicine at the University of Leiden. In 1904, he worked in bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute, and in 1908 he became a full professor of bacteriology at the University of Amsterdam. In the 1890s he was involved in `` World War I '' research, but his wartime responsibilities necessitated his transfer to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, where he worked on infectious diseases and on natural processes. Wilfrid was a personal friend of Edward Jenner. In 1907, he was made a Knight of the Order of the British Empire.  
 In 1928, Wilfrid became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences ( KNA ), and for the next 27 years he served as the KNA's director. At that time he was one of the main advocates of a Mycology with a Very Life attitude. After the war, Wilfrid was in total denial about his wartime activities.  
 In the last years of his life, Wilfrid spent a considerable amount of time in intensive rehabilitation work, and his health greatly deteriorated. After he died in Amsterdam, the Albert Amphibia Foundation ( AWF ) conferred upon him the Order of Merit.Wilfrid did not greatly influence the developments of mycology, and his only contributions appear to have been his attitude to theories such as `` Helicobacter pylori - through the meat of Montelius '', and his frequent reference to pathogenic bacteria.

Bürberstein ( born in Breslau on August 15, 1846, died in Halle on October 18, 1918 ) was a German pianist, composer and teacher. He was also a prolific teacher, composer, and music publisher.  
 Bürberstein's name comes from his father, Scharberitz ( 1734-1788 ), a born pianist and a teacher at the Breslau School of Music. Scharberitz was married in 1822 and took several pupils under his baton. His son Bürberstein became the sole teacher in the famous school of piano.  
 Bürberstein's father was a talented teacher at the Breslau School of Music, earning a government scholarship for his son and giving his sons ample opportunities to develop their musical talents.  
 From the beginning of Bürberstein's musical career, his compositional interest focused on the study of piano works by Scharberitz, a classical composer, but his success was more in the form of composition.  
 Bürberstein's first compositions were commissioned by Scharberitz and subsequently published under his name in several works.  
 His most famous pupil was the young German pianist Emil Blücher ( 1829-1882 ), who would go on to be a prominent pianist.

Hans Heinrich von Wiedemann ( born 13 September 1844, Dreyfus near Freiburg im Breisgau, died 28 November 1908, Dresden ) was a German naturalist, botanist and entomologist.  
 He was professor at the University of Breslau. He studied geology in his spare time, publishing his work on rocks in 1899, published under the pseudonym Otto Eduard Vopper ( the origins of the German initials `` Vu '' stem from the Latin word for sun, and `` cortus '' from `` van '' ).  
 He was one of the first to extend the fossil record of living marine organisms to those deep in the ocean, especially in the very deep areas of the Antarctic, where extensive cavities can provide abundant opportunity for fossil animals to show off their special characteristics. His search for new specimens of marine insects and other living materials which might possibly have been speciated by dinosaurs also led to the discovery of many new species of dinosaurs, such as Iguanodon.

 Jaap Franck is the author of nearly 400 papers and several monographs. He was the first to work on spider venoms using the formaldehyde extraction method. With the help of Miguel Angelina Martins, he investigated the zoological activity of the European Calliphora species. His research on the fauna of Colombia, served as a basis for the establishment of the zone of life of the state of Oaxaca. Among his earlier studies on spiders, he showed that the genera Calliphora fam., Calliphora monographum, Calliphora subunni, and Calliphora urefractalis are considered to be of genus Pellythia, of which he named copteraria.  
 Jaap Franck was the first to gather spider data in south-eastern Brazil. The location of this place was collected from 1928 to 1934 during expeditions in the Patagonian Lowlands. He made his spider collection the focus of fieldwork projects of the KUVO, for the last five years of the 1970s. Besides collecting the field samples and a detailed description of the spiders, he also collected specimens of birds and animals.

Max Janko ( January 22, 1921 – November 17, 2008 ) was a Swedish-born, Czechoslovakian, Czechoslovakian biologist and psychophysiologist known as an authority on histology. He was one of the earliest scientists to study the effects of testosterone on sperm motility.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Janko was born in Rosengård ( then part of the Austrian Empire ). He received his doctorate at Lund University in 1935, specializing in physiology. He returned to Lund in 1945, as an assistant professor of experimental physiology and head of the biology department. In 1948 he was appointed to the psychology faculty at Lund University. From 1948 to 1955 he served as director of the department of biological sciences.  
 Janko's interest in hormones led him to a book, The Gnostic Serum, written in 1954, the year after he had his doctoral thesis. His work on brain functioning led him to start an ongoing collaboration with Prof. Axel Stoelschmidt, the Head of the Department of Experimental Medicine, and his younger brother, Hans. A second edition was published in 1991. During this period Janko developed `` electrochemical optogenetics '' into a whole field in neurology and psychology. This research has been extensively cited in books such as Hans's Neuroelectrodynamics and Isaac Asimov's Science in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.  
 Janko was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973, jointly with Arnold Schwartz, for his discovery of the action potential of dopamine on the respiratory cycle. It was not until 1975 that Janko published his first paper on the physiology of sex hormones in the Journal of Physiology and was rewarded with the Herbert Plaster Award.  
 In 1975, Janko published his seminal paper with Sc.D. Anders Fjordman that published the volume `` Clinical and Translational Studies of Testosterone : Its Relations to Sex Development, Moods, and Personality ''. The paper would contribute to the field of comparative psychology and would lead to his appointment as an associate professor at the University of Stockholm in 1986. In 1996, Janko founded and served as the founding chair of the Faculty of Psychology and was succeeded as Professor by Niels Henriksen who had taken up the post in 1988.  
 In the United States, Janko ’ s book `` Testosterone and Brain Development '' was used by the United States National Institutes of Health in a landmark 1982 paper.

He was a member of the American Antiquarian Society and a visiting professor at several universities, and was also well known as a prolific writer on agricultural, botanical, and phycological subjects. He also published many works on the scenery, literature, and life of Maine.  
 His famous poems, Virago ( 1850 ), Camille ( 1849 ), The River Journey ( 1852 ), What the Devil Said, The Goose-Hearted Dog ( 1856 ), and The Magnificent Island ( 1872 ), are regarded as the classics of fiction.  
 He was interested in botany, but a passion for botany was his calling. He spent time working with spiders and specimens, and he demonstrated much knowledge in this field. He died in Lewiston, Maine.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Several of his poems, including `` Virago '' and `` The river-saw '', won a reputation as classics, and he edited the 1841 and 1843 volumes of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Nietzsche's edition of his works, Die gesammelte Sprachwissenschaft. These volumes contain a number of studies of poets and thinkers, with essays and brief autobiographies. The Noskeum edition of his works was compiled and edited by Allen Harry Salter ( 1876 ).

 = W. A. Segrè =  
William Aurelio Segrè ( Italian : [ ˈɑejrə ˈsuːɲ ] ( listen ) ; 1 June 1912 – 27 December 2007 ) was an Italian composer, music teacher and music theorist. He is best known for his award winning Piano Concerto for Orchestra. He also wrote numerous studies and piano exercises for children of all ages.  
 Born in Paris, Segrè studied piano at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1930–1933. He studied under the noted composer Domenico Balzani. In 1935 he became a member of the so-called `` Italian Opéra '', an elite professional school at the École Nationale d'Académie des Beaux-Arts. While in Paris, he became the subject of the book Frédéric Chopin : Quasi Evangile Composita ( Chopin : Portrait of a Unique Style ) which, though extremely influential, remained unpublished for years. In 1956 he returned to Italy, to spend three years teaching and studying with Balzani. Segrè studied music theory at the Sorbonne in Paris from 1958 to 1969, where he was simultaneously awarded the Prix de Rome in 1968 and the Prix d'Italia.  
 After his return to Italy, Segrè took a call from Milan to join Balzani's highly regarded International Piano Players'Union ( IPCU ). He taught there for thirty years. The IPCU represented a generation of composers influenced by Balzani's teachings. Segrè taught a symphony which was completed only twenty-six years after Balzani's death in 2004.  
 He was the first chairman of the International Society for Compositional Studies ( ICS ) from 1993 until he retired in 2007. Segrè chaired ICS for nearly seven years. After leaving the ICS, Segrè founded the Research Chair for Musicology at the School of Music and Drama of the Turin University, where he established several symposia and an international conferences. In 2002 he founded the Milan Festival for Contemporary Music. Segrè died in Milan, Italy.

Joseph Shachtman ( February 13, 1904 – June 11, 2001 ) was an American mathematician. He was born in Antwerp, Belgium and earned his BA in 1915, his M.A. in 1916, and Ph.D. in 1916.  
 Shachtman's best known interest was causal mechanics, and he described more than 20 of the many rigorous and general cases in which monochronous systems of Newtonian laws can be found.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Shachtman was a prolific scientist, editor of a number of textbooks, and taught, in addition to teaching mathematics, physics, and statistics at the University of California at Berkeley, the mathematical department of the University of Chicago, Stanford University, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Columbia University, and George Washington University.  
 Shachtman was a pioneer in the field of causal mechanics, with papers on x-ray diffraction and its application to motion theory. In 1936, Shachtman and David Perry published their joint article, The Pairs of Einstein's Experimental Relativity, where the authors summarize three major aspects of relativity : the interpretation of Newton's equations in terms of the ( previously unrecognized ) causal relationship between general relativity and quantum mechanics, the determination of Newtonian spacetime ( with Lee Henderson and Floyd Spencer ), and the formalism that gave the story of the genesis of the theory a new and elegant form. For these works, Shachtman won the award for the best article.  
 In 1968, as part of an ongoing collaboration with Ray Anson, Shachtman published a series of textbooks in computational physics that compared the topological basis of QCD to that of CCD.  
 Shachtman did his most extensive research on the non-relativistic nature of classical mechanics, which he characterized and also showed through careful examples.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 Shachtman was a corresponding member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Royal Society of London, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.The name Joseph Shachtman comes from the day when he stopped his study in Kiev because of poor health, and the talented pianist Weizmann.

 = Frederik R C3 BCnheim =  
Frederik Georg Rénheim ( 12 June 1861 – 24 February 1937 ) was a Danish mathematics teacher and physicist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Copenhagen in 1861, Rénheim was the son of a teacher and the uncle of mathematician and physicist Frederik Rénheim ( 1809–1898 ). Rénheim studied chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, from which he graduated in 1882 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked as a chemist in the munitions factory of Chemikbladet until 1885, when he became a physics teacher. During his earlier years he also worked as a glass-blower. In the beginning of the 1890s he published two papers, on dyes and melting points, on melting-points of iron and glass and on thermal constants. The second paper was received mainly with considerable praise.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1896 Rénheim was hired by the University of Copenhagen as a laboratory teacher and theoretical physicist. In 1908 he was promoted to the position of professor. Rénheim was also the organiser of the Intercalation-ringing-concert which occurred from May 1896 to May 1903 in Copenhagen. The conference was attended by a multitude of luminaries and distinguished personalities, including later Nobel Prize winner August Schleyer, the writer Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and e.g. Ludwig Boltzmann, who had worked with Rénheim in the same laboratory. Rénheim was the director of the institute which became the International Institute for Polar-Temporal Experimental Research.  
 He became a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences in 1922, the Royal Danish Academy of Engineering in 1925, and the Danish Academy of Sciences in 1932.In 1897 he discovered the René I. Schneider krigesling ( René I. Schneider–Schurmeyer effect ) that allows to distinguish a particular type of fluid from any other type in a liquid state. The value is 0.53 m2/s2. In 1927 he published a new differential equation on dyads, which still survives. It is a function of the dispersion coefficient, known as the René I. Schneider krigesling function. It explains a phenomenon occurring in anodes, cathodes and perforations. The most important limitation of this variable is that it is effectively a differential equation that depends only on the dispersion coefficients. Other types of liquids require a formula that can be derived from the René I. Schneider krigesling function. This is the formula of the René I. Schneider particle density function.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The René I. Schneider krigesling and René I. Schneider–Schurmeyer-effect are widely used in glaciology.The National Museum of Denmark holds René I. Schneider's laboratory equipment as well as physics instruments in its archives.

 = Pedro Xavier de Souza da Silva =  
Pedro Xavier de Souza da Silva ( 1911 – 20 January 2003 ) was a Brazilian meteorologist. He is considered a pioneer in explaining the 1997 Tropical Cyclones in South America ( CUNR ).  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Pedro Xavier de Souza was born on 10 June 1911 in the family of alfresco cattle ranchers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. His parents were also religious, João Luis and Joaquina Pedro.In 1917, he was admitted to the Rio de Janeiro State University. As a student, he was asked by Professor Pedro Castro Alves to do a work on Meteorology. After completing his course, he was invited to join the weather section of the Brazilian Weather Bureau.  
   
   
 == Weather Bureau, meteorology department ==  
 On the recommendation of Alves, he went to work at the Bureau and started investigating the consequences of the 1893 cyclones, which hit South America. He helped predict the cyclones in the U.S. as well as Brazil. In September 1896, he joined the meteorological department of the Bureau. He was the first man in Brazil to be named head of the meteorological section.  
 During his time in the weather department, he gave up his studies to concentrate on the weather observations.  
 On 4 November 1928, a cyclone of the magnitude 2 struck São João ( capital of Minas Gerais state in Brazil ), where de Souza was stationed.  
 In 1932, he was promoted to senior meteorologist.  
   
   
 == Demonstration of a cyclone ’ s motion that lasted for hundreds of miles ==  
 During the year 1936-37, de Souza continued to make calculations on the motion of a cyclone, but was unable to observe any motion. For the first time, he made measurements on the motion of the cyclone's surface. The motion was observed by Gustavo Cid in São Paulo in 1938. In 1939, de Souza published the results of his observations on the motion of a cyclone which lasted for around a dozen kilometers. The measurements showed that the motion of the cyclone had continued for more than a hundred kilometers for more than 10 kilometers, in contrast to most of the movements observed in the early or mid 19th century. With the help of such observations, de Souza began work to explain the unusual motion of the 1995 Tropical cyclones in South America.  
 During 1940, he contributed to research into the solar hypothesis which proposes that the motion of a super-cyclone is the result of two factors : a sunspot group and its mass.  
   
   
 == Weather manipulation ==  
 From 1936 to 1938, de Souza worked as an aide of Cid at the Institute of Meteorology of the National Research Council, the department of meteorology of the Brazilian government.  
 He helped with the calculation of cloud speed and variability. During 1938, he became a Weather Bureau volunteer for the Agricultural Research Institute, in Brasilia, where he was assigned to their Aerosol Research and Development Department. As a volunteer, he was sent to several observatories in the United States, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the National Weather Service of the United States. From 1942 to 1948, he worked as meteorologist and educator in the weather departments of the Spanish navy.  
 He was the director of meteorology and the division director for several years, until his retirement.  
 In 1954, he helped design and build a weather station near the recently built Rio Indio Airport.

 = William Woodward (pastoralist) =  
William Woodward FRSE FRCPE ( 16 March 1838 – 12 August 1933 ) was an English lecturer in British languages. He is best known for his writings on the history of church history.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Woodward was born at Ewell, the first son of pastor John Woodward and his wife Annie, a pianist, of Bryn Terrace, London. His early education was in a gymnasium in Manchester, and the business of rector of a grammar school in Sheffield. He then spent some time in his father's school, in a preparatory school run by John Cobden. His early life, however, was not distinguished. He suffered from smallpox, and was educated privately until he was eighteen. He was educated for the medical profession, taking classes in pathology at the Sheffield Royal Infirmary.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was appointed postmaster at Sheffield in 1847, and afterwards at Mayton, South Yorkshire. During the years 1850-1851 he was the author orator at the Sheffield Synod, for which he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, 1852. In 1856 he was appointed professor of the History of Church History, and was a consultant to the Red Cross during the Great Misfortunes.In 1861, Woodward began his career as a teacher of the history of the church in Britain, a post he held until 1873. He was also in charge of the History of the British Church from its Reformation to the Present Day, and of the liturgical periodical The New Religion. At his death, he was closely associated with the Clarendon Foundation.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 His most important work is A Description of the Synodal Exhortations which was published in five volumes ( London, 1855 ). He also edited Hyrum Smith's The Church of England in 1848. Woodward's large collection of church records ( Cambridge, 1872 ) is still in use and contains 300,000 personal diaries of theologians, bishops, and clergy. His Masonic method of church history ( London, 1850 ) influenced the division of the Church of England into 12 Orders in the Second Vatican Council.Woodward is best known for his new series of The History of Church History in six parts, as a continuation of John Ray's ( 1827 ) work on the history of England. This series of books was highly regarded by G.W.F. Chalmers in 1880. Woodward's Church History of Britain was enthusiastically re-printed by the American scholar J.W. Dallender and William D'Herberard in 1882. Although no longer in print, that of Dallender and D'Herberard can still be found in a small number of publications, for example by Samuel Gladstone. He also published an edition of Sir William Paterson's Record of England in 1873. Woodward's lectures are accessible, but not free of errors ; like many of his contemporaries, he was opposed to Lycurgic editing.  
 Woodward wrote The Compleat Churchman ( 1866 ), which is still in print in editions by Walter Bagehot. In 1873, he wrote Two Englands, A Comparative and Preliminary History, 1652 to 1767. This work has become known as an essential treatise on church history.Woodward was also the author of A History of the First Early Church of Scotland, ( 1878 ) and Acts of the People of England, 1771-1773 ( Cambridge, 1894 ).

 = Nathaniel Kelly =  
Nathaniel Kelly ( January 22, 1789 – July 27, 1858 ) was an American clergyman and a scholar of science. He was born on January 22, 1789 in Carrington, Vermont. His father was George Scott Kelly, an attorney and general judge. Nathaniel was the elder brother of the famous physician Benjamin Lasswell Kelly. Nathaniel Kelly died on July 27, 1858 in Fredericksburg, Virginia, from consumption.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Nathaniel is reported as having been born in New York City. He is said to have been raised at Aspen, Colorado, and graduated from the Aspen College, in 1821. In 1829, Kelly moved to New York and entered a professorship in engineering. In 1832, he was appointed professor of chemistry and physics at Harvard. In 1840, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and was a member of the Academy's editorial board in 1837–1839 and the college's management committee in 1840–1842. Kelly represented New York on the editorial committee of the magazine Science and Medicine from 1839–1851, and served as president of the New York Zoological Society from 1852 to 1856.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
 Kelly was a Professor of Chemistry at Cornell University in 1833. In 1845, Kelly took a year's leave of absence to make his Ph.D. in Germany on the geology of Germany. On his return to the United States in 1856, he became an assistant professor of chemistry at Princeton University in New Jersey. In 1859, Kelly became president of the Academy of Sciences in New York City. Kelly was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1863 and elected vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870.Kelly was a member of the American Philosophical Society and a trustee of the institution. He was appointed president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864, a committee member of the American Philosophical Society, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1876, and president of the American Academy of Political and Social Science in 1885.  
   
   
 === Military service ===  
 While serving as a member of the U.S. Army's Geological Survey, Kelly acted as the bridge between early American archaeologists, amateur naturalists and archaeologists of European ancestry. According to University of Pennsylvania history professor Karl Racine, Kelly had a vision in the 1850s of the time when minerals would appear on the earth as seepage from deep valleys in the earth and became a leading advocate of the idea that the map of the earth was not reliable.  
   
   
 === Director of the Field Laboratory ===  
 In 1864, Kelly succeeded the Rev. T. H. Stringer as the director of the Department of Physical and Chemical Geology of the Cornell University. As a naturalist and a scientist, Kelly had an eye for collecting fossils and exploring the oceans of the world. For four years, Kelly worked on expeditions to Costa Rica and Panama and to the Bahamas. His records are held at the State Archives of New York. Kelly's great goal was to find known underground lake deposits. Kelly was interested in the geology and mineralogy of China.  
   
   
 == Teachings ==  
 Kelly was well-respected by the class of 1866. The Journal of the Geological Society of America called him `` one of the most illustrious natural history teachers in the country ''. He showed that human activity can affect life in organisms. He made the point that `` a man's personality is not a function of his surroundings but one of his physical, mental, moral, and spiritual faculties ''.He opposed attempts to `` purge the family of the childish illusions of the early youth '' and preached that `` the soul '', in the sense of intellectual life, was `` old and rotten. `` In the University of California Hall of Fame, a group has formed to honor Kelly's contributions to education and scientific research.The current Charles Eliot Norton Lecture on Teaching Chemistry at MIT was initiated in 1995 by Charles Eliot Norton, president of MIT. Norton was the only president who served as secretary of the modern seminary, Rector of Boston College, Rector of Harvard University, and professor of the history of science at the University of Texas at Austin. The MSRC selected William B. King as the keynote speaker, a member of the modern seminary, and an early mentor of Kelly's at Cornell.

 Shephard was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the Royal Society in 1789. He married a Marie Danielle. They had three daughters : Jules, Charlotte and Elsa. In 1794, he married Alma Maria Waldensberger ( 1781–1846 ), the daughter of a Berlin benefactor, a supporter of the Prussian parliament. After he took his wife's family's surname, Shephard's inherited the surname Martel of Bavaria. The Martels were influential in encouraging the aristocracy of Bavaria to accept and use the new German spelling of their surname.  
 Shephard resigned as a professor of geography at the University of Berlin and his reputation suffered, but by the late 1800s he still held active position as a member of the Board of Directors of the Royal Society of Berlin. He retired in 1817, living at St Paul's Square, London, where he died at his house, 15 John Street, in the East End.

 = Gustav Enghilde-Eynyh =  
Gustav Enghilde-Eynyh ( 13 August 1814 in Erzgebirge – 5 January 1883 in Kiel ) was a German Assyriologist and linguist.  
 Gustav Enghilde-Eynyh ( usually spelled `` En-G. '' ) was an important German Assyriologist and historian in his own right, and was the first head of the 2nd Oriental Commission at Assyriological Institute at Marburg, and the first person to become chairman of the Aegean Expedition to Sumer, 1884.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Enghilde-Eynyh was born in Kiel to the German nobleman Carl Emanuel Eduard Enghilde ( 1781–1854 ), a university professor and writer, and his wife Elizabeth ( 1796–1859 ). He received an honorable medical degree, in 1808, and pursued a science in Kiel under the auspices of his professorship, a Hebrew forgery. Upon his return to Germany, in 1814, Enghilde-Eynyh set off from Kiel for the Aegean, where he spent his working life, writing and writing to get paid. When, in 1826, Enghilde-Eynyh tried to join a similar expedition at Epirus, the request was refused. He learned from the French that a pair of scruffy schoolmasters from Rome were attached to the expedition, and sent word to the men's families that he was headed on foot. When he arrived at the naval station in Paphlagonia, he encountered stony hostility, despite the friendly natives'wishes. Enghilde-Eynyh also had to deal with health problems, including an appendix and a stomach-burn that left him with a scar at the end of his career. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1837, the Doctorate of Philosophy degree, the Doctor and Doctor of Laws degrees in 1841, and the Honorary Deputy Professorship of Hellenism in 1859.

He is credited with introducing numerous minor new subjects, to major old ones in the field of ancient Anatomy. He attempted to revise the Greek version of the first Egyptian grammar, but he failed. In 1853 he published The Ancient Mysteries in three volumes, together with Latin, the latter being based on the Latin text of the Old Testament. He succeeded Ernst Höcker in office at Erzgebirge as professor of ancient languages in 1874. His main area of interest was the Phoenician language, in which his technical skills were considerable. He subsequently joined the `` School of the Fathers '' at Marburg, to which he was a part-time lecturer in Ancient Greek. He was sent to Ionia by the German people, where he was the recipient of the award of the title of professor ( as well as the rank of honorary professor ) by the Imperial Court of Russia and the Kievan Kingdom ( for his lectures on cosmology ).

 = Mary Muldoon Ewing =  
Mary Muldoon Ewing ( 15 July 1842 – 11 April 1934 ) was a British anatomist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Ewing was born at 22 Sandlington in Berwickshire, Wales, and was educated at Sherborne's Grammar School. As a child she was friends with her brother John Seymour, and they would travel together often, and the summer they explored Scotland together. She had a nervous system of her own, and developed epilepsy as a consequence. Ewing died at the age of 12, after a long illness. She was survived by her parents and sister.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The term `` Xylohemie '' ( in German, `` Ewingismus '' ) is used to refer to her views, which were very strongly grounded in her knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Ewing was a lecturer on anatomy at Newnham College, Cambridge for most of her life, but also worked as an anatomical lecturer and in the anatomical museum of his father, Herbert Russell Ewing. In addition to being recognised as an expert on limb structure, she was a keen amateur entomologist. Her greatest interest was in the insect chapter, and her treatment of the species Pandallinae. She also cared for severely malnourished orphans, both in her spare time, and after she had retired.  
 In 1882 Ewing published her second major publication, Lividity and Extinctions of the Mammalian Family Emphytenidae, a catalogue of Emphytenidae in which the species are grouped according to size, breeding material and vocalizations. She worked mainly with emphytetes, for which Emphytenidae are named.  
 Ewing also published numerous articles on insect anatomy and reproduction in the publication The Insects of the World ( 1884-85 ), which helped to popularise the attention she gave to this chapter of her work. Her observation of oviposition had a role in establishing the fact that sphecia were not `` tiny cells of capillaries in the endoplasm of cells of little size. `` Ewing also led several expeditions on expeditions to Egypt and Western Asia, her most notable one being from 1881 to 1886, her private expedition to Japan ( where she made copious notes on the insect migration patterns and species-level changes throughout the region ).

 = George Emerson Taylor (pathologist) =  
George Emerson Taylor ( March 8, 1876 – June 1, 1963 ) was an American pathologist, lecturer and professor, best known for his work in animal pathology. He is noted for his work on the causes of rickets, secondary lesions of the bones of the lower extremities in the choroid, urethritis, and in campylobacter and typhoid.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Taylor was born in York, Pennsylvania, the son of John Quincy Taylor ( 1821-1884 ) and Barbara Ethel Evans ( died 1919 ). He was educated at York High School ( later Wyandotte Academy ) and Albion Academy, a private school in Chelmsford, Connecticut. His father died in 1884 when Taylor was fourteen years old. Taylor matriculated at Albion Academy on February 12, 1886, after taking an anatomy course. He graduated summa cum laude from Albion Academy in May 1887, and he moved to Boston at the end of 1887 to study medicine at Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1890. He obtained a licentiate degree in medicine from Harvard in 1892, a licentiate degree in surgery from Harvard in 1894, and an MD from Harvard Medical School in 1895.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 On January 14, 1900, Taylor left Harvard Medical School to join the American Pathological Society in Europe ( APS ) as a pathologist. In 1901, Taylor was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Belgium and Belgium, the Royal College of Surgeons of Scotland, the Belgian National Research Council, and the Belgian National Institute of Pathology. He was in charge of Belgian pathology and sent a letter to Prince Louis, Duke of Edinburgh, requesting that he turn his Princely Charitable Foundation over to Taylor in which he asked him to concentrate on a medical topic. Charles Green, physician to King George VI, was one of the editors. After the First World War, Taylor became the examiner of pathology for the newly formed World Health Organization ( WHO ) and joined the group in November 1949.  
   
   
 === Tuberculosis ===  
 In 1912, Taylor was commissioned by the California Medical Society ( CMS ), which funded his work on tuberculosis. Taylor enlisted in the US Army and, after being wounded and blinded, served from September to November 1917 with the 101st Airborne in France, and after the war. Taylor was assigned to the 245th Infantry Regiment. He was discharged from the army at the end of the war, and began teaching and teaching at the CCS. He returned to the university in 1918 to teach pathology to a small student body in Seattle, Washington. In 1921, Taylor was appointed as a lecturer at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Taylor died at age 52 of tuberculosis, in Milwaukee on June 1, 1963, and is buried in the Far West Cemetery in Washington, D.C.  
   
   
 == Contributions to histopathology ==  
 Taylor's clinical work was classified by Janet's published cases into three distinct groups. The first group, though numbering only ten, is noted by A.M.E. Taylor, `` made him the leader of the histopathologic class of diagnoses and served as the driving force for histologic advances in the field. '' This group included tuberculous pit, pitous ulcer, and type II urticaria.  
 The second group, `` classified by William Bateson ( 1893-1952 ) as a subgroup of diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis, included tumors of the pancreas and adrenals. '' The third group, Taylor believed to be `` the blood group most dangerous to human life '', `` comprises immune deficiency syndrome, morbid obesity, muscular dystrophy, tuberulocystic disease and morbid obesity, and all belong to a class of diseases ’ s primarily pathological pathology, wherein, due to the abnormality of metabolism and the accumulation of serum lipid and triglyceride, the organism is subjected to very high levels of a toxic diet of the blood.  
   
   
 === Family life ===  
 In 1895, Taylor married Olive Emmons, a daughter of labor leader George Emmons. They had one daughter, Virginia.

 = Nicolas Durand =  
Nicolas Durand ( French : [ ˈdʒilh̯əçd ] ; 7 August 1796 – 16 June 1872 ) was a French mathematician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Nicolas Durand was born on 7 August 1796 in Toulouse, France. His father was an estate agent. At the age of fourteen he enrolled at the University of Strasbourg, where he received his M.A. in 1802. He then went on to pursue studies in mathematics, the natural sciences, and politics at the University of Toulouse, receiving his doctorate in 1808. In 1813, he was admitted to the chair of logic at the University of Leiden, and in 1815 he took a position as assistant to the mathematician Bernard Gombert. In 1817 he was appointed to the chair of logic at the University of Toulouse, where he remained until 1836. He also taught at the Sorbonne, the University of Paris, and at the universities of Basel and Berlin.  
 In 1826 Durand founded the journal Revue Generale. He was also the chief editor of the journal Reviews ( which he founded himself in 1816 ). It has been suggested that the long name Durandzeis de l'équationsgeographique can be derived from this journal. He wrote the first known treatise on elliptic functions. Durand ’ s work on the number of conic sections is regarded as being the most influential work on the problem of conic sections ever written. He invented the expression for the approximate solution of elliptic equations in geometry by applied functions, and improved the technique of matching polynomials to curves.

Friedrich Arnold ( 30 July 1798 in Darffingen – 19 April 1873 in Cologne ) was a German polymath. He was the father of jurist Friedrich Arnold. He developed the Arnold logic, with its Gödel equality theorem, which proved to be an exact foundation for formal logic.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Friedrich Arnold was born on 30 July 1798, in Darffingen, and studied the classics in the University of Cologne and the University of Breslau. He was educated in Berlin, where he was one of the freethinkers. In Berlin he attended the lectures of Christiaan Huygens and Friedrich Sinfonia.

 = Wilhelm Lutzler =  
Wilhelm Lutzler ( 5 September 1828 – 1 October 1924 ) was a German mathematician and economist. He was born in Strasbourg, Strasbourg, and studied mathematics, physics, economics and history, graduating from the Leipzig Gymnasium in 1873, with a dissertation on inequalities and expansion of bridges. He worked as a merchant in Munich for four years, and was appointed a lecturer in jurisprudence at the University of Münster, receiving his doctorate in 1884.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He studied logic, philology and history at the universities of Strasbourg, Münster and Göttingen, lecturing on topics ranging from classical logic to logics of the Frankfurt school. In 1895 he returned to Germany, where he established his own office, the Lutzler Associations, specializing in mathematical economics, in collaboration with Friedrich Martin Ehrenberger ( 1893–1928 ). He taught at Münster for over forty years, and was a frequent lecturer at international conferences and institutes, holding visiting professorships at Berlin ( 1899–1900 ), Leipzig ( 1901–1904 ), Hamburg ( 1906–08 ) and the University of Frankfurt.  
 Among Lutzler's outstanding contributions was his work on parameter theories, based on his theory of relative phases ( Böhm–Ludwig theorem ). His most famous theorem was his exploration of the question of whether even lower-valued classes of prices are bounded by higher-valued classes. In it, he concluded that the ideas of Hobbes and Say hold true even for lower-valued classes of prices.  
 In his analysis of economics and politics, the eighteenth-century world map is often used to illustrate the relationship between trade, banking, population growth, technology and economics in general. In 1797, he published his famous economics of a still developing medium of transport, the Deutsche Böhm-Ludwigsche Elektronie, first published in the form of an eight-page diagram in the Königlich Quadriffe. It is an economic work still in use today.  
   
   
 == Selected publications ==  
 Schriftenprobleme ( 1883 ), was devoted to the translation of German natural science. The catalog of his efforts is located in the Luftsammlung des Mittelalters in Munich, where the manuscript had been deposited in 1877, posthumously.  
 Der Geometrie, algebraische und geometrischen Zeitschrift ( 1887 ), which contains 12 chapters and over 350 images, is considered a classic in economic theory.  
 Mathematische Grammatik. Two volumes, ( 2 vols., 1898 ), together with the original German, were prepared in 1884 and 1885.  
 Antikeiomen mit dem Ergebnisse der Gebiet ( 4 volumes, 1901–1904 ), a standard textbook on economics, was published under the editor's name in 1901.  
 Die Lehre von den gehörtlichen Zwecken, in two volumes, 1911–14, was dedicated to Ernst Zermelo and written mainly with Luise Jevelot in collaboration with Gustave Hubatz ( 1890–1943 ) and with Max Simao ( 1869–1940 ).

 = Oskar Jungreider =  
Oskar Jungreider ( 15 March 1849, in Rothenburg, Hesse-Darmstadt – 15 March 1927, in Berlin ) was a German physician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jungreider was born in Rothenburg, and studied medicine in Halle and Berlin. In 1868, he received his habilitation and professorship in Berlin, from the latter which had belonged to Wilhelm Wetzler. Jungreider then returned to Halle to teach medicine and natural sciences, where he was appointed director of a rural training school. In 1889, after completing a medical doctoral degree in Munich, he became professor of general internal medicine at the University of Marburg, as well as dean of the medical faculty there. From 1893 to 1897, he was President of the Insel Charitable Society and also a member of the Bundestag. He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896. He married in 1895 Maria Edelmann, a nurse, to whom he had two daughters. The couple had five sons and one daughter. After his death, he is buried at Hildesheim Cemetery.Jungreider was the author of the systematic textbook Psychobiology ( 1886 ) and a large number of texts concerning local physicians, and took part in the discussion of diseases and customs of rural districts in the Zeitschrift für Medicin Obstheleitung.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 In 1874, Jungreider published his first major work concerning psychiatric disorders ( Zur Alterthumsamkeit der psychoses ) in the New York Medical Journal. In this work, Jungreider claimed that psychoses arose from the destruction of the `` sensory ego '' by the organs of the nervous system. Jungreider also gave cases to support his theories about malignant neurasthenia, agoraphobia, neurasthenia with Lewy bodies and pyramidal neurasthenia ( a type of cholera ). In 1885, he was also one of the leaders in German psychiatry during the period of the Silberstein's movement, a movement opposed to general psychiatry in Nazi Germany. His second major work is entitled Pathologische und Erbeungen aus Elektrizität ( Pathology and Essays about Electricity and Electricity Therapy ). In 1891, Jungreider published another work, Pathologische and Einheiten ( Pathological and Einheiten ). In this work, he advocated a complete recognition of `` electrical energy '', with its archetypal aspects, and of `` electromagnetic powers '' as such. Although this work was not translated into English, it is still in use today. He further specialized in brain disorders and neurophysiology.  
 Jungreider also wrote pharmacology, physiology, psychology and entomology.Jungreider is remembered for proposing a systematic treatment of neuropathy, that included psychosurgery, and, more recently, a theory of the pathological behavior of prostate cancer. According to the American journal, Addison-Wesley, the urologist and physiologist Carl Stanfield, ( 1899–1928 ), is the only one to use the term `` cancer '' to describe the disease. He may have come up with the term `` prostate cancer '' himself, given to him by himself.

 Liotke discussed many topics, of which Geography is a prime example. One of his notable contributions is his map on the island of Süd and the adjacent fields of the Southern Österreich. He described the island on 16 August 1812 in a series of articles in the “ Provincial of Liège ” journal, and published the `` Island of Süd '' in a memoir ( in Liège dialect ) published in 1814 in two volumes, containing many descriptions of land, lakes, trees, and much more.  
 Liotke divided Geographical units into geographical grades, and therefore between the seven chief centers of the high geography of Europe, or the six-level arc ; and gave the state of all the higher grades of this arc in 1812. Liotke assigned so-called “ treelike ” time periods to certain stations : 1811, 1811/12, 1812, 1814.  
 Liotke said that the old district of Süd was found first in the mountains of the Smiler Basin. This is close to the Friesian Alps, and can also be found to a lesser extent by way of the Übrenberg river valley, where the age of the earth had begun long before the Norse-Saxon ( possibly Phoenician ) age. ( This would mean that Fries'mountains, and the appropriate mountains of Hesse, Saxony and Baden-Württemberg, were probably younger than ancient Fries ). It is then located within the westerly part of the Österreich.  
 Liotke also wrote a volume on one of the Weimar districts, where, according to his contemporary Rüdiger Halbherr, the study of geology was rewarded with a prosperous career and life. ( Liotke's five-year-old son, Artur, used to go to school there daily in 1810, and worked on a meteorological instrument. ) Liotke viewed the geography of the Weimar zone as integral to the development of the culture.  
 Liotke considered as a centre of fauna ( all species ) in the sea a region of territory up to the Danube river, and that of terrestrial vegetation from lakes, the greatest of which he also defined as the Bennea-Bad-Wagen.  
 He defined the Swiss Gannet as the home of thousands of ducks or geese.According to a source, Liotke took his name from the legendary “ Julius Caesar ”, son of the Argonauts ( den Jakob de Jujans, il Joms den Kündens Julius, E. Y. Glawson ) who became a Greek colony in the Crimea. After the war, Caesar succeeded in restoring his noble rank, and followed in the path of his father's descendants.

 = Nikolaos Tsatsoulineas =  
Nikolaos Tsatsoulineas ( Hungarian : Δικολός Θυάριος ; 8 October 1741 – 11 October 1820 ) was a Hungarian entomologist and plant collector.  
 Tsatsoulineas first began collecting in the Silesian mountains near the town of Berzelinyi in 1772. He later traveled to Cretaceous times and collected insects and plants from large regions around the Balkan Peninsula. Beginning in 1776, Tsatsoulineas explored the Cretaceous formation, collecting plant material, insects, molluscs and invertebrates as well as fossils.  
 His main focus was botany, especially several taxa of the order Apis. In 1821 Tsatsoulineas discovered about 6,000 specimens from Silesian hydrocarbon deposits. However, the remains of M. boiziensis ( the pitcher plant ) are thought to be a contribution from Tsatsoulineas'earlier work in that year.  
 Many of the crustaceans and worms collected by Tsatsoulineas had later been described by Johannes von Laberdijk.  
 From 1782 to 1814, Tsatsoulineas was a professor of zoology at the Royal School of the Arts in Budapest.  
 His collections were destroyed during World War I but fragments of the research collections in the University's museum and several of his research specimens survived and were brought to Budapest to be studied. Tsatsoulineas died in 1820 and was interred in the Friedterkirchenhof. He is commemorated in the name of a species of edible lizard, Cotesia iniacea ( today Cotesia verdeana, probably the species described by Tsatsoulineas ).

 Dantin was born at Toulouse on 3 July 1824. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and from 1834 to 1839 studied natural history at the Ecole Nationale supérieure, Lausanne. In 1842 he became a professor in botany and natural history at the Société agricole de l'Etat ( to which he was transferred to in 1845 ).  
 The first volume of his numerous zoological books was dedicated to Dantin, who was one of the editors ; the third volume, De bryologie botanique ( 1843 ), contains great illustrations of ferns and the genus of plants. The author is not named, but it is certain that he was very much interested in plants from a practical point of view, and in botanical subjects as well. His services to the scientific literature were significant in the area of botany, and his articles on the genus Desmodium were published in the Phycologia Zoologica by Ferdinand Potier and Jean Richet.Dantin's main interest was the floral and fern families. His botanical works deal with a great many species, as well as the general systematics of species. Some of his illustrations are particularly useful. In the 3rd volume of A study of the species of the genus Desmodium, one of the species featured, Dantin noted the unusual chinstrap-like structure of the seed glands, and with this species Dantin was also the first to give the species name Desmodium gressulifera. The additional and more general names Desmodium angustifolium ( 1843 ) and Desmodium diefosca ( 1844 ) were likewise introduced.

 = Nathaniel Moore =  
Nathaniel Moore ( 28 October 1729 – 3 May 1811 ) was an English Quaker, theologian and missionary in the New World.  
 He is remembered chiefly as the author of one of the earliest English translations of a German hymn to the Sacred Heart.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Moore was born in London, the eldest son of John Moore ( 1710–1788 ), by his first wife, Anne Robertson ( 1708–1760 ). After studying at the King's School, he passed the bar, and in 1752 entered the London Botanic Garden under Sir Robert Dalton. Moore married Catherine Willcox of Sandhurst, Kent, on 4 March 1756, with whom he had no children. He returned to London the following year.  
 He was a Calvinist and associated himself with Thomas Kish, Robert Elliot and John Balfour.  
 In 1757 he set out to make journeys through Liberia, Tamaulipas and Sierra Leone. He had reported in 1758 on the issues of whoredom in the colony ; his report of this journey was a misfire. While undertaking this, he lost his ear, and so had to learn to speak with a cane. In 1758, he wrote London and Other Notes on the Dominicans, and the Poor Man's Gospel of St. John. He followed the same route in 1759 and in the following year was carried to Geneva by a Danish vessel, the Rondeau Grampus. He died there, 1811.  
 Moore developed a theory of Chinese Protestantism, developed by J.F. Smith in his 1761 book The Origin of the Chinese Church, that the theory was first stated in 1759 by Rev. Nicholas Cooper, and partly retold by J.H. Martin. Moore seems to have discovered the actual `` ancient Church '' of China, one which predates the Emperor of the Ming dynasty by over four centuries.  
 According to Moore's theory, the use of money was associated with the very earliest Pentecostal ( evangelical ) Protestantism in China. Thus, Moore suggests that the practice of one coin on the day of Pentecost ( Fuhuan ) was a monetary substitute for one formerly issued by the First Opium Commission ( named the Chinese Tong Dynasty Commission ) in 1600.Moore, like other early nineteenth-century English Quaker missionaries, translated the Great Holy Theotokos into the Malay language, and was well-acquainted with the great Chinese Hermit Hui. He also wrote English versions of the Chinese chuan in two volumes, five years after the translation of the Great Theotokos had begun.  
 Moore's own prose works are poorly known. In 1770, Thomas Doggett, in his `` Life of Nathaniel Moore '' ( London, 1770 ), relates how Moore produced `` some noblest of all Songs. Of pure beauty and by power of perverseness of writing, very learned and genteel sounding of rhetoric and profound exposition, containing a collection of glorious tales which are to every ears that worthy and pious Apothecary he's especially desirous to have written ; some of them may be now fitly taken to be authorized histories... allusions, allegories, poetry, history, games, military narrative, romance, comedy,....

 = Richard Percival Catterall =  
Richard Percival Catterall ( 1 November 1847 – 11 April 1909 ) was an English classical music composer and music teacher. He is best known as a leading exponent of the contemporary Romantic school of German piano music. Catterall created a rich standard of music written in the Romantic style and, in particular, wrote numerous works for the piano and for organ, popular piano music and several symphonies.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Catterall was born on 1 November 1847 in Queenshill. His father was George Catterall, of Lancaster, Buckinghamshire, who was a manufacturer. His mother was a sister of George Henry Pylorus, 7th Baron Pylorus ( 1690–1763 ) of Isleworth.  
 Catterall studied at the Royal Academy of Music at the Royal College of Music in London, gaining a BA in piano in 1891 and subsequently studied piano at the Paris Conservatoire. From 1893, he taught piano at St Albans High School, and was appointed music director there from 1893 to 1897. He was awarded a CBE in 1895, and also received the Prize for Distinguished Services to the Art and Letters by the King in 1900. He died on 11 April 1909 in Leeds.  
 Catterall's piano music was typically based on his own experiences and was remarkably original and sharply experimental, featuring counterpoint and especially line dancing and solo piano. His technique was clearly established in this period, but his composition was more thoroughly developed, and his sound gave him a reputation as an intensely cultured composer.  
   
   
 == Early works ==  
 Catterall's first piano music appeared in 1897. While he was at the Royal Academy of Music, his `` adolescent '' compositions gradually turned into mature works, including a set of six pieces for piano and organ. He created eight of these, which were published posthumously by the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1911.He published more than two hundred works for piano and organ. In addition, he composed :  
   
 Piano quintet, piano trio, four piano sonatas, two symphonies, sonatas for piano, organ and percussion, and a symphonic cantata ;  
 Violin concerto, which made him the first to use use the viola in that role ;  
 Sixth Symphony ( 1896 )  
 Concerto on the Science of Cosmology ( 1897 ) ;  
 Six symphonies ( 1898, 1899, 1902 ) ;

Gottfried Hilberg ( German : [ ˈhtʁilɐ̃ ] ; 1879–1945 ) was a German anatomist who specialized in the anatomy of the upper digestive tract.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Hilberg received his doctorate from the University of Basel in 1907. From 1910 to 1918 he worked as an assistant to Bernhard Speller at the university of Heidelberg. In 1920 he received a doctorate from the University of Berlin, and became a professor in 1928. He was posthumously elected a foreign member of the Royal Society in 1935. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences and Leopoldina.  
 In the early years of the twentieth century Hilberg argued for two main arguments against histamine hypothesis : that histamine is poorly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, and that histamine could only be passed through lipolytic phospholipases which prevent the oxidation of histamine.  
 He suggested that inflammation can be a major source of gastrointestinal malabsorption ( exudates ), that tumors predispose the intestines to increased myelination, and that exudates are discharged by overlying muscles, similar to that produced by the passage of saliva through the mouth into the pharynx.  
 He also proposed the microhistoritay hypothesis, where histamine can be more easily formed by the metabolism of `` phobias '' and discomforts.  
   
   
 == Selected publications ==  
 He was director of the Innsbruck University of Medical Science ( 1937–1942 ) and was then assistant professor of anatomy and histology at the university of Tübingen ( 1942–1946 ).

 = Mark Youmans =  
Mark Youmans ( 15 November 1904 – 8 January 1989 ) was an American immunologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of the immune system of the cornea.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Youmans was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He received his B.A. in biochemistry from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. in immunology from Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.In 1947, Youmans and Frank Feynman developed the Rubinstein test, which is used to determine whether an antibody produced by the skin of a human being is soluble in aqueous solutions. ( It may be possible to isolate two different types of IgG, but the test can only detect binding-specific IgG of only one type. ) When assessing how well antibodies bind, Weinstan adds `` that one of the important parts of the assay, but not the whole thing, is that there is never enough assays to determine in practice the exact affinity of the antibodies for different types of molecules ''. [ 1 ]  
   
   
 == Teaching career ==  
   
 At Johns Hopkins, Youmans was the driving force behind teaching immunology in the School of Biochemistry and Medicine. In 1953, when Johns Hopkins merged with the Johns Hopkins University to form the University of Maryland, he headed the newly created immunology department. In 1954, Youmans became associate director of the Center for Immunology and Laboratory Biology, and four years later, his team won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Chemistry. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1955.  
   
   
 === Immunology research ===  
   
 Youmans is best known for his research on the antigens produced by the cornea, in collaboration with colleagues L. W. and J. Harrison, who later became colleagues in the Cornea Development Research Center at Johns Hopkins. [ 2 ] There, they worked to understand what parts of the cornea were involved in the production of the antibodies.  
 They also distinguished between the monoclonal antibody-producing cells and a heterogeneous group of immune cells that consisted of blood cells and an immune lining called the T-cell differentiation cascade, which they later named youmans cells. They were particularly interested in the ABC of monoclonal antibodies, which in contrast to antibodies produced from blood, is a specific peptide that does not bind directly to a surface. In 1954, Youmans developed a test for the detection of CD41, the peptide that labels the ABC of an antibody, and the result was a paper on ABC-positive cells and an accompanying text explaining that the results were due to slight differences in antigen binding to their ABC. In 1958, Youmans was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.During these years at Johns Hopkins, Youmans also published about ten papers that added to the knowledge of T-cell function. Together with L. W. Harrison, youmans developed an antibody against Shigella and by 1966, the findings established that the antibodies do in fact bind to the own antigen of Shigella, thereby contributing to defining the importance of the staining technique and of white blood cells. [ 3 ]  
   
   
 === Death ===  
 Mark Youmans died of meningococcal infection, a type of pneumonia.  
   
   
 == Selected books ==  
 One of the books Youmans edited, which was published posthumously by the The Johns Hopkins University Press, was written in collaboration with S. B. Meade and C. L. Marsh, who had been working together in an alphabetical index of microbial antigens.Another of the books Youmans edited, published posthumously by the The Johns Hopkins University Press, is the standard text on the immunology of the human cornea. Youmans's other books include The Immunity Bowel, Discovering the Heart, and The Neglected World of the Antibody.

After 1923, the two became embroiled in personal controversies. On 21 February 1943, Sulzberger threatened to sack Gor, since the ZAGAS committee investigating the Korbi Party allegedly published material that was negative about Gor. He also discussed working with the Soviets at the end of the war.Gor was elected a senator in the Polish National Assembly on 19 October 1951. He was elected as a deputy of the Federal District of Czechoslovakia on 7 February 1956, he was then appointed Minister of Culture. He held the same position in 1956-1963 and in 1967 became Minister of Finance.After defeating Hitler's forces in the Second World War, Gor retired from politics.

Jacques-Louis Agard ( 28 November 1860 – 2 August 1949 ) was a French zoologist who discovered in 1876 that the human digestive tract contained a mucus layer rich in amoebae. This discovery was the start of a successful modern field of research of amoebozoans.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Agard studied at the Paris Natural History Museum and the École normale supérieure. While an instructor at the École Normale Supérieure, Agard observed during 1888 in a field trip to la Chapelle de Crécy an example of autolytic amoeba, a group of small amoebic larvae containing the larvae of Euterpe and Trichogrammatode. He discovered that the larvae of Euterpe, which are generally not eaten in this country, contain the chameleon larvae for feeding, and in the presence of lacustrine eggs, the larva begins to develop into autolytic amoebae and in 1886 discovered autolytic amoebae in a small swamp.  
 From 1889, he taught at the École de chimie des sciences sur la France. In 1895 he returned to his native town and published in French the findings of his excavation at the Salle de la Loire on the island of Antigua. The work was important for science in his home country because the absence of any proof of entomological distinctions between the species was brought to light. The work was widely studied and proved that it was the oral bacteria of Coccidia which were the cause of skin disease. Agard was the first European to distinguish the toxins produced by Coccidia from its protozoa. ( This experiment was later dubbed the Agard-Aspirin–Bototropis experiment. )  
 As a distinguished scientist, Agard became a close friend and associate of botanist Auguste Lamarck.  
 He became professor at the Ecole polytechnique and the chair of zoology at the same university ( 1958–1961 ), but his first scientific published work on amoebae was in 1903. The bibliography for these papers is widely available at the Amazon in Mémoires sous l ’ Académie des sciences et naturelles de France, Annuel de l ’ Université de Strasbourg, du règne Fondation, Bibliothèque bibliothèque des Sciences et des Arts Naturales et Le Départements du Méditerranée ( published on 16 December 1913 by G.-M. Coté ).  
 In 1904, Agard worked for 3 years on experiments involving the growth of a host by means of a broiler. His first published paper on this subject was `` Zur Differentiationkunde der Vertebrateen '' ( on the development of the embryo in fishes ). In the same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

 = Piotr Popoviček =  
Piotr Popoviček ( Polish : Piotr Popoviček ; 5 May 1914 – 10 October 1989 ) was a Czech-Polish theologian and Catholic priest. He is best known as a Pole and physicist. Popoviček was born in Nihonji, Czechoslovakia, son of František Popoviček ( baptized 20 November 1915 ), a Czech patriot and headmaster of a Polish gymnasium, and Mstislav Jilka, a Polish immigrant. He was educated in Prague and the Pilsen gymnasium. His father was an elementary school principal and high school teacher in a school at the Zarekkii candolka, and his mother, having become an evangelical Christian and the head of the nunnery, went to Polish-occupied Yugoslavia to be ordained. While in Pilsen, in September 1941, Popoviček worked as a teacher and research assistant for the Polish army in Albania, Romania and Bulgaria. His role there provided some intellectual and material support for the foundation of the Polish National School for the Replacement of High School Failure.  
 After his return to Poland in 1946, Popoviček completed his secondary education at the Polish Sociological Institute. He married Elek Sierłocki in 1949 and had a daughter, Ola Trepka.  
 He became parish priest in 1951, and was named chaplain to Sładysław Kreman in 1953, which was the same year that Kreman was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta. Popoviček became the archdeacon in 1962. He retired in 1980 and became a visiting professor at the National Catholic University in Prague. He died in 1987 in Weł-Altenhausen.  
 He was a physicist, a fellow of the Academy of Sciences in Belgrade. He is particularly noted for his creation of the computer program and the journal Electronic Human Communication.

 = Barbara Straus =  
Barbara Straus ( January 19, 1917 – September 6, 2007 ) was an American sociologist. She was awarded an honorary PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in 1978. She is widely known for her studies on the nature of gender and the social and cultural environment of women. Straus has written widely on the effects of women's social roles and on the history of feminism.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Education ===  
 Straus was born in Langford, Maine on January 19, 1917. She graduated from the University of Maine in 1934. She married Benjamin Straus, a political scientist, in 1937. They have one son, Joel Straus.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 Straus was a social scientist at Berkeley. She lectured at Stanford University for over 35 years before leaving to become a professor of sociology at UB. In 1961, she and her husband moved to Washington, D.C. to join the Women's Policy Research Center ( WPRC ), working there for five years until her death. She would leave a journal called `` Division of Woman in Economics, '' which she published with her husband and which was the first peer-reviewed journal to explore women's economic roles. This article discusses a few of her findings, and concludes that `` Differential impact and development of educational environments in economic lifetimes of women and men's siblings '' can contribute to a `` relational dynamic that is true of women in families. '' She is also credited with providing the first approach to promoting gender equality as a social value in economic field studies, and examining `` the value of women on the laboring class and on the factory floor ''.  
   
   
 === Opinions ===  
 Straus's research with WPRC was influential, not only in the development of women's rights as a community ideal, but also in the development of educational funding and policies for women in academia. Straus was a supporter of the student women's movement and would influence women activists in the field of gender studies in both the United States and in Canada. One of her main critiques of the effects of student activism on the academic environment was that what was difficult in the classroom was rarely common in the boardroom, which is why it was so important to get public support for these social change efforts.  
 Straus was also highly critical of social expectations of women in the study of labor and women ’ s social roles. She noted that the requirements for `` equitable treatment '' in school gave women no clear positions to fulfill, and that schools `` should be places that foster new standards rather than impose new standards. '' She said that `` Instead of discouraging early college graduates from pursuing meaningful careers, these standards should be used in their place, encouraging vocational careers instead of awarding awards to honor high school graduate placement. `` Additionally, Straus said, with a class large enough to teach history, in her opinion, it is necessary for women ’ s studies ’ more than ever to ask what women ’ s potential for economic success and achievement is. Straus is also an advocate of women ’ s as social and economic subjects, noting that it can help women ’ s voices and careers.In the end, Straus said, the most important research her book has to offer is the value that academic disciplines may offer to social research. While she acknowledges that this value is seldom recognized in the academy and often offered only to one side, Straus takes particular issue with the rejection of labor studies by social scientists, and the unwillingness of women and men to use empirical science for class purposes. She believes that such problems can be solved by acknowledging that intellectual and moral struggle is possible. Thus, she believes that a study ’ s importance should be assessed by what it offers to the broad community.

 = Charles Rigby Silliman =  
Charles Rigby Silliman ( 10 June 1892 – 1 January 1995 ) was an English journalist and political journalist. He was a professor of philosophy at University of Edinburgh.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Charles Silliman was born in Edmonton, Alberta in 1892. He was educated at Hillfield School in Devon, but, shortly before graduating, he joined a far-right press shop to serve as a press secretary in the Washingon Patriot Mail Office, where he was called to a British Government job as correspondent for the official newspaper of the Temperance movement.  
   
   
 == Opposition to the war ==  
 In 1910 he joined the Union of Socialist Labour ( U.S.S.R. ), and was drafted into the American Second World War. For the next few years, he fought in Europe, including a bitter campaign against German occupiers in World War I. He was awarded the Second Lieutenant's Badge of Military Merit, while others received naval decorations.Silliman joined the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and joined the Communist Party ( KPD ), the National Socialist German Workers'Party, which was banned by the Nazis. For his first decade in England, Silliman produced a series of critical articles for the Communist Press Club and other radical newspapers. In July 1940, he left for London, and remained there for four months.  
 In February 1942, Silliman joined the L.P. ( Loyalist ), but switched sides at the start of the German-Russian War and became an intelligence officer with the British army, before becoming Assistant to the Allied Commandant in the Atlantic and in Egypt. He later joined the U.S. Army.  
   
   
 == Later career ==  
 In 1943, with the assistance of Erich Fromm, Silliman organized a huge underground campaign on behalf of the KPD and its Russian sympathizers, which became known as the `` Booker Affair. '' He was arrested and imprisoned, and as a result of his work, the government charged Silliman and 10 others for anti-war activity. His trial took place in Kraków and was well attended ; newspapers as far afield as the BBC, Radio Free Europe, and The New York Times were critical of the government's handling of the trial. When he was acquitted in 1945, he and Fromm were awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. During this period, Silliman moved to Cambridge to continue his work with the U.S. Army Intelligence Service ( S.I.S. ). He became a professor at the University of Cambridge, and then went on to teach a course in philosophy at the University of Edinburgh.  
 After the war, Silliman returned to the lecture stage and appeared as a guest of the Society for Economic Administration, a conservative think-tank. In 1955, Silliman was expelled from the group, along with Evand D Coster, an American academic specializing in American historical thought.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 After retiring in 1962, Silliman became Director of Columbia University's Heriot–Watt Laboratory for Advanced Studies. In 1974, Silliman edited a biography of Camille Paglia, The Spirit of Paglia ( Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1979 ), and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. In his later years, he undertook his own biography of David Goodman.In 1989, he was divorced from his second wife, Lorin Gorelick, and married Elinor McFadden, who had also retired from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. When her interests moved to the posthumous publication of Counting Sheep in 1994, Silliman received his share of attention, and was awarded the Alexander Hildegarde Steenoe Memorial Prize in Economic Ethics by the Federation for American Studies. He died in Edinburgh, Scotland on 1 January 1995.

 = John Barnes (painter) =  
John Barnes ( 31 July 1779 – 11 April 1856 ) was an English preacher and churchman known for his work on the architecture of the Roman Catholic Church.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 In 1778, Barnes was born to his family in Bristol, England. His father was a surgeon. In 1782, Barnes entered Christ's College, Cambridge, and proceeded to study medicine under Dr James Fuller, leaving to study architecture. He gained an LL.B. in 1793, and after two years spent at Christ's, he went to England.  
 In 1795 he received a professorship in Catholic philosophy, and thereafter he worked for several years in Denmark and his native England. He died in 1856.  
   
   
 == Early work ==  
 During his university career, Barnes studied Roman Catholic architecture, especially church plan. He noted the `` traditional roof of the cottage-cabin '', and the enclosure roof of the Gothic Church of Notre Dame cathedral. He wrote in 1803 his monograph on the `` plan of the cathedral of Rome '' ( a work for which the Cologne cathedral is particularly notable ). Barnes was a noted artist, and there are 20 detailed plates of paintings ( of brick, of woods, etc. ) in his library ( c. 1893 ).  
 Barnes included also the `` arch of the Gothic '' of Pope Gregory XVI. The title is a pun of Barnes'suggestion : `` Arch in glanzer archem paravisen '' ( `` Arch in Greek Paradise '' ) ; a phrase he often used, used as an argument of the Bishop of Oxford's `` forbidding '' to close the School of Architecture to Lutheran enrollment.  
 A valuable document is the `` appendix to the castle at St. Regis '' ( Boscobel ) ( appended for the convenience of the Bishop of Milan in 1805 ), arranged in the following orders :  
   
 ARCHEL OSMITH - ABADER I - MABIE V - DELI - ARROPELI - ERNSANDO - HAUGHEY - HARRISI - LEBOUT, - MASELAIS - NAYOMIS - POSNAN, - SALOR, - SCHUDRACH - SILVA - SOCCERUS - SOTORIS - TURTULA, - THEODOREI, - ULBRICH, - VIRGINISZEWSKI, - WARIEWSKI, - WALES, - WHITLEY, – ZAMALA,  
 ARCHENAC - ZIMMERO - MILESZO -  
   
   
 == Architecture ==  
 Barnes was the author of over two hundred architectural drawings, and in 1809 completed a design for the Roman Catholic Cathedral at St. Regis, now one of the oldest churches in Germany, with an interior tower a few metres in height. He described his plans in several works, two of them published in Le Monde Revue and Lettres sur le Monde, and at a second exhibition held in London in 1813.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 A detailed biography of Barnes is given in the  
 Harry Chapman Baker Historical Dictionary. The biography by J. W. Atkinson is about both the influence of Barnes on Bishop Ward and also was a master of British obituaries and commentaries.  
 Barnes'last academic work was the Deutsche Insekten der Heiligen Werther ( Deutsche Museum of Modern Art ), named after the state in which he spent the last decade of his life. The remarkable artists who created this monumental building were close to his heart, including Paul Schumann, an important architect of his time, and a Prussian patron. Barnes died at his home at Boscobel, near Cologne, on 11 April 1856.

 = Ludwig Alfred Julius Leutwirth =  
Ludwig Alfred Julius Leutwirth ( 12 February 1801 – 29 September 1870 ) was a Swiss mechanical engineer and metallurgist.  
 He became a professor at the University of Zurich in 1824. In 1831 he moved to his new position, which was one of the first in Switzerland and possibly the world. One of the main uses of his laboratory was to study metallurgy. His main interest was in steam engines, and particularly the trade of producing copper furnaces.  
 From 1835 he was one of the main sources of energy for the streets of Zurich, with his patron Lord Frederick Augustus Ouseley de Rondelar. Leutwirth was active in the neighbourhood of Mont Blanc, the site of the world's first major metallurgical works ( Alsace Haute-Moselle, Le Cercle ), which received its name in 1835. His reputation today is relatively unknown, and it is widely thought that Leutwirth was the inventor of `` euglossism '' ( throwing lots of money at the wrong person ).  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Leutwirth has been described as `` a pioneer of the mechanical engineering, an accomplished engineer '', as he created the first steam engine. Other significant works include :  
   
 Leutwirth's Economic Survey ( 1828 ) was a commentary on economic theory published in its first edition.  
 Leutwirth's System of Planners ( 1835 ), described Leibniz as `` somewhat rational. ''

He also was an engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ), and was on the faculty at Iowa State University ( IA ). He published more than 150 papers, eight books, and over a hundred technical papers.He was a pioneer in the study of superconductivity, the phenomena he observed in the conductivity of metals, and was the first to measure the heat generated by electron-proton collisions in ultra-pure superconducting metals. Lee is best known for his work with magnetron interferometry, which he used to demonstrate the existence of electron-proton collisions at the heart of the 'hot'superconductivity. In the 1960s, Lee conceived of the concept of human mobility in magnetic resonance experiments by using magnetrons to create variously spaced piezoelectric surfaces on microscopic scintillations. He is also widely credited with publishing a theory of thermodynamics that sought to understand the geometry of thermal equilibrium, and to the development of digital computers.

 == Biography ==  
 Born in Philadelphia, McNulty was educated at Rhode Island School of Design and spent his youth in Virginia. McNulty received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, both earning his doctorate in applied mathematics. During his graduate studies he also worked at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he was responsible for the theoretical foundation of the theoretical physics of light, finding that photoelectric effect was not required in order to produce light. He was also one of the most important early advocates of pulsed laser photodiodes and the development of cosmic ray lasers. He developed the design for a pulsed laser from scratch in 1961. That led to a 40-year effort to develop advanced pulsed lasers. McNulty began using the development of the pulsed laser at the Argonne National Laboratory in 1961. Later, it was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.  
 McNulty's research also included the early applications of vortex tube in physics and photonics, and lightning research. He was the first scientist to utilize the wavelength of x-rays, widely used in modern-day medicine, as a reference value for x-ray light emission. In 1966, he proposed the conceptual system for polarimeters for measuring light intensities.

 = John Randall ; Mary Phelps =  
John Randall ( 1812–1881 ) was a Methodist Methodist theologian who argued that the belief in `` co-creator '' must be limited to the theistic arguments against theism, not a concession to theistic materialism. Randall believed that being a true Christian was a matter of living in the world in which God created, and he asserted that each believer had a certain degree of responsibility for the acts of his or her life. Randall taught that human history is the product of events that are actively participating in God's creative efforts, with the occasional exception of miracles and the Fall. Randall contended that the primary sin of man is his failure to do the will of God.Randall was a prolific writer, publisher, and teacher. In addition to many books, seven of which he wrote independently, he also wrote several well-known hymns and a prophetic work, The Oration, or Spirit Commentary, which was published under the pen-name John Randall in 1841. His hymns are among the earliest known Christian musical compositions, and few modern composers have adopted his ideas. He was appointed Professor of Theology at the University of Michigan in 1889 and his style was studied in the philosophy department of Clark University, with a dissertation on classical rhetorics entitled The Philosophy of Matthew. Randall taught in Clark University's College of Arts and Sciences and as a professor and examiner of grammar and rhetoric at Clark University's College of Philosophy from 1892 to his death in 1925. He was the editor of The Principles of Logic, a compilation of controversial theological ideas from the standpoint of metaphysics, moral theology, and aesthetics ; a commentary on the late Assyrian-Hebrew prophet Idušah ( 1838 ) ; a work that dealt with Amraphel ; a tract entitled Problems of Deism ( 1867 ) ; and, in 1870, the acclaimed Canterbury Confession of Faith ( entitled Words with Divine Inspiration ).In 1849, John Quincy Adams and a group of students read an article in The Christian Century by Randall. Randall replied with an article published in The Progress Magazine that discussed the free play of the mind in God's providence. Randall was among the three co-founders of The Improvement Era in 1854, published by a fellow student, Prof. Thomas Jefferson Davis, in part because of his strong public rhetoric and his beliefs in `` the doctrine of Divine co-creature ''. Randall's American Version of the New Testament was published as a pamphlet in 1857 and he also wrote several prolific sermons. Randall taught theology at Michigan for two decades, from 1891 until his death in 1925, and he was also an occasional correspondent for the New York Times and American Age. Randall was also a major contributor to the journal The Christian Century, often commenting on controversial topics, and he contributed to the work of a number of newspapers, as well as for his lectures at Clark University and at the Clark Library.Randall and his wife, Mary A. Phelps, had four sons, including a son, Daniel R. Randall, who served in the Navy during World War II. In addition to his popular evangelical sermons and hymns, Randall wrote two shorter poems, and a series of articles and books, and authored or contributed numerous other books. He was also a well-known merchant and cooper and published his own music ( `` Cornish Concerto '' ) and music for church music ( `` Beethoven's Medallion Suite '' ). Randall died on December 24, 1925, at Oak Park, Michigan, after a brief illness.

Karl August von Schafer ( 17 April 1818 – 28 July 1891 ) was a German Lutheran theologian.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Schafer was born at Weihensee, near Koblenz, but, being inclined to the Roman Catholic faith, was baptized into the Lutheran Church in Koblenz. He entered the seminary at Koblenz and studied theology. In 1833 he was appointed, as rector of Salzburg, to the chair of dogmatics and theology. He had a brief but a fruitful friendship with J. E. Schubert, who afterwards became his assistant. He was at first assigned the chair of Hebrew grammar and the abbreviation of `` Schum ''. In 1837 Schafer resigned his appointment in order to give a very liberal course of lectures. In 1841 he was appointed pastor of Peschen.  
 He was at first sent to North America in 1846 to succeed C. S. Lewis, but on the death of Lewis, he was appointed first to a professorship at St. Catharine's, and then to one at New Ulm, Minnesota, where he had been appointed professor of Greek and Hebrew in 1836. From 1849 to 1853 he was professor of Hebrew at the University of Copenhagen.  
 On the death of E. R. Hanssen, of Johannesburg, he was chosen professor of Greek at the University of Berlin. His successor, Carl Wilhelm Leif Bender, was the teacher of numerous Orientalists in Europe. From 1858 to 1861 he was professor of philology in Rome.  
 In the later years of his life, his time was occupied chiefly in his linguistic studies, and in 1859 he was made professor of philology at the University of Leipzig, where he served from 1862 to 1866.  
 In 1855 he obtained the gold medal of the German Academy of Sciences for his Liber Cursus. From the following year to 1860 he became distinguished as distinguished for his translations from Greek and Latin. He completed an English version in 1860, and also published, in 1860, an Oriental dictionary, which was in a very nearly completed state. In 1857 he founded the Franckischen Biographien des Göttingen, which included under its head a German translation of Rameau's Elementary Arabic.  
 He died in Leipzig in 1891.

 == Biography ==  
 Eric Herschel studied classical philology, philosophy and politics in Dresden from 1905 to 1910 and Germany from 1911 to 1912. In 1912, he graduated from the universities of Leipzig and Göttingen. During the First World War, he served as a combat engineer in the East, and in 1917 was promoted to captain of a combat transport regiment. In 1919 he became an instructor at the universities of Leipzig and Erlangen, as well as a lecturer and research fellow at the University of Leipzig. In 1924, he was awarded a doctorate by the University of Erlangen.  
 Herschel's work on the palynological and botanical nomenclature of Tasmania and North Queensland from 1925 to 1938 were noted by William Crookes for his results on the aetiology of some Tasmanian molluscs and also on the plant taxonomy of Tasmania. In 1938, he was promoted to be a professor at the university of Marburg, where he led a group that analysed the trematode fern in the Marburg Schneeburg Bath which was the first documented sample of such ferns. He became the first to discover and characterize pollen cores from the fossilised aquatic grass Salix stantula. His study of morus rhacophila showed that it was a rhododendron.  
 In 1940, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died on 7 May 1963.

 = Ellen Aldridge Quain =  
Ellen Aldridge Quain ( July 17, 1888 – May 30, 1981 ) was an American naturalist and one of the most prolific published writers of the 20th century. Her first book, The Flowers of the Nile, was published in 1903, and was a major factor in leading to the creation of the Nile Barrier and the Central-American Pluvial Commission of the Smithsonian Institution.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Ellen Quain was born in Grand Island, Maine. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Clark University in 1929, and completed her Master of Science degree in ornithology and comparative biology in 1934 at University of Maine College of Medicine. She was awarded the first Herbarium Fund Fellowship in 1950, the second in 1952, and the last in 1962. Her studies were undertaken at the University of Minnesota and the University of Virginia.Aldridge worked as a research assistant to Thomas N. Dighton, a bryologist and early African-American naturalist, in the 1930s. Quain published her first paper on African plants in 1956, and in 1958 she became a full professor at Cornell University. She also published several other papers. As the plant garden grew in size at the University of Maine, she was selected to research the concept of building for the garden, publishing a book in 1961, titled Blue Garden for Blue Skies, which launched the creation of the Blue Garden for Blue Skies program.In the 1930s, Quain came to be known as a lover of nature, and a faculty member at Cornell University, where she taught from 1944 to 1954. Under her direction, her alma mater achieved among the largest botanical collections in the world, including a $ 3.3 million botanical museum in Katrine Hall and its exhibits on the sciences and humanities. She continued to work at the University as a faculty member until her death on May 30, 1981.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Quain is noted for introducing Americans to the flora of the Nile. However, her work was also used to develop the first African coast guard in the 1930s, and an important figure in the implementation of the Central-American Pluvial Commission. It comprised prominent botanists such as the botanist Frank F. Silverman, who developed techniques for identifying the chemical origin of natural habitats, and biologist M. W. Olsen, the forerunner of the Appalachian Naturalists'League.  
 She also published several other works that had a lasting impact on African-American women, including the book Charlotte Quain and the St. Louis Gull ( 1961 ), a spiritual autobiography, and the 1963 book Where Did All the Birds Go?.

Aleksandr Makayevich Peacock ( February 5, 1918 in Slavyansk – October 11, 1998 in Leningrad ) was a Soviet rocket scientist and the vice-president of IAC in 1953. In the same year, he was appointed as the director of the Visiting Professor of Spacecraft ( in Russia ) program at the Institute of Hydrodynamics ( in the United States ). This program lasted from 1958 to 1962.  
 Peacock was a leading student of Nikolai Popov and worked on its theoretical, practical, and practical applications in rocketry.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Peacock was born on February 5, 1918, in Slavyansk, Ukraine. In 1938, he graduated from Leningrad Institute of Engineering Physics in Ukraine. Then in 1940, he moved to the United States, where he was a researcher at the St. Louis Physical Laboratory of the University of Missouri and at the National Research Institute of Systems Technology and Engineering ( NISTES ) of the United States. He also taught at the University of Illinois, where he was then Professor of the Meteorology and Oceanography. In the same year, Peacock was also a professor at the Institute of Physics of the Joint Institute of Technology of Varna, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Institute of Education and Career Research of the Moscow Technical University.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Aleksandr Makayevich Peacock was given the commission to design and launch a spaceplane called the Proton rocket after Popov's unfulfilled predictions. Later, he would also develop a small winged rocket.  
 Peacock's NASA-funded project was called Triatomic - launching an electron-positron accelerator at NIMH,. So far, in early 1965, the first test flight of the world's first full-scale triatomic particle accelerator, called  
 Comet Whiz, took place at the Delta-V facility at Anderson Air Force Base, Florida. It was an attempt to study neutrinos.  
 Around the same time, Peacock developed and operated one of the first satellite-mounted pulsed ion accelerators in history, called the PCM-51. The measurement of energy discharge induced the first detection of a neutrino, the gamma rays, in cosmic rays.  
 Peacock then continued his work on the traveling rail. He was the first to demonstrate the geomagnetic pulsed electromagnetic accelerator with a laser. Peacock built this laser-based experiment, operated it on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the Florida Cape, and measured neutrinos in the system. He was the first to use this device at one-fifth the energy as previously known. However, Peacock's calculations about the effects of physics around pulsed electromagnetic accelerators were only applicable to the stationary system.  
 In 1967, Peacock and the College of Engineering of the Moscow Institute of Physics, Moscow, became the pioneers of high-energy synchrotron physics. This allows physicists to measure complex phenomena like the spectrum of the weak nuclear force, X-ray activity and many other phenomena.  
 In 1976, he became head of the Department of Physics of the Institute of Experimental Physics of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and then became its director from 1980 to 1988. He then returned to the Soviet Union.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 In early 1938, he married Natasha Semyonova. Their son, Dimitri Peacock, was born in 1958. He died in Leningrad in 1998.

Frederic W. Brewster ( February 15, 1836 – October 30, 1920 ) was an American astronomer who was professor of mathematics at Harvard University from 1888 to 1892, and professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago from 1898 to 1898.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Brewster was born in 1836 in Stoughton, Massachusetts, and grew up on a farm in Norton, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard College and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1879. He then earned a Master of Arts in 1883 and a Ph.D. in 1884 in mathematical astronomy and physics from Harvard.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 From 1884 to 1888 Brewster was professor of mathematics at Harvard, a position he held until 1901. During this time, he published works on astronomy and astronomy-physics. He served as chair of the mathematical department from 1894 to 1907, and was a founding member of the American Astronomical Society. In his work on atmospheric turbulence, Brewster first recognized that the absolute temperature of the atmosphere was the same in all directions at all times. In 1901, he also claimed to have solved the scientific problem of migration in the atmosphere, a result that would later become known as the Brewster shift.  
 He became assistant to Frederick William Coon Knuttigan in 1896, acting as fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1901, and then Professor of Mathematics in 1903, at the University of Chicago. In 1905, the United States Bureau of Mines created the gold-standard dewpoint of 24 inches ( 50 cm ) for aircraft use and in the following year, Brewster and his assistants built a dewpoint table in 10″ x 15″ blocks for use by meteorologists. The Army Meteorological Office constructed an angular Dew Point scale for the US Army and Dwight D. Eisenhower used the scale to record the progress of the morning dew charts during his presidency.  
 In 1902, he published his magnum opus, Celestial Mechanics : An Introduction to Celestial Mechanics, in which he showed that the Solar System is a curved conic pyramid. Later in 1904, he published a second edition in three parts ( a final volume was never finished ) and created the Dew Point scale, called the Brewster scale. He also developed a system of time units called the `` Hydromagnetic units, '' which worked like the square root of 2/10. Brewster received the Medal of Freedom in 1916 and the Medal of Honor in 1919.  
   
   
 == Professional association ==  
 In 1899, he became president of the United States National Committee for the Scientific Exploration of the Sun, the National Committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Society of American Abstinent and Metaphysical Astrologers, and in 1920, he became president of the American Astronomical Society.

 = Charles K C3 B6ster =  
Charles Karl Köster ( 18 November 1881 – 14 January 1965 ) was a Swedish economist who served as a professor of economics at the University of Chicago from 1924 to 1961. The University of Chicago is named in his honor.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Charles Karl Köster was born in Kolmasen, and studied at the Department of Economics of the Swedish Imperial University in Köthen, from which he graduated with a doctorate in 1927. His doctoral work was entitled `` Uppenbarne statistischer Societas förförbundskola veränderelserelse Statistiska Experimentationer aktive Selning som världsktningen '' ( The Legal Institutions of a Statistical State Experiment. The Research into a Social State Experiment ). The first translation of the book into Swedish into English was published in 1930, following a reprint.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Köster had originally studied at a college in Stockholm. As a result, he became acquainted with Carl Menger. Both, he and the Kaiser's health insurance company, Knaurer, tried to organize the Swedish socialists to obtain a much-needed strike. But despite a refusal from the Kaiser's health insurance company, and difficulties obtaining insurance coverage from it, all attempts failed. Köster, having found the scientific methods used by Menger ’ s work and is now using those methods himself, became acquainted with and a believer in the theoretical ideas of Karl Marx. Karl Marx himself, even at this early stage, had a close friend in Köster. Köster, like other progressives of the time, was also the President of the St. Louis Anti-Saloon League. He had become a Marxist and became an intellectual representative of the Jacobin Society.  
 In 1928, the Swedish Social Democratic Party succeeded in becoming the governing party in Sweden. Köster left the Social Democratic Party in 1934, supporting the social democracy led by Alfred Nobel.In 1934, the Kaiser's health insurance company ( Jonsson skalbart ) was dissolved. Swedish President of the Swedish Social Democratic Party-elect, Gustaf Godräther, wished to deal with the fallout from the dissolution of the health insurance company that they might get insurance from the state, and Köster found the financial difficulties he encountered in Köthen ( i.e., for the time being, his salary as professor of economics ) overwhelming. Köster spent two years on an unpaid research job at the Lund University. He started a PhD under the supervision of Jonsson, which resulted in the production of a book entitled `` Statistiska i världskonomiska analytiska statistiska experimenta ( Theory of Statistics and Its Applications ). '' The book is perhaps the first serious attempt at understanding the causes of the Great Depression and what one can do about it.  
 Köster remained in Lund until 1937 when he obtained a chair in economic statistics at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( 2012 : New York : Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0-19-2033887-7 ). There he studied the trend in the Swedish market rate between 1906 and 1938, and thus came to work on the development of a national inflation index. His theories about the nature of investment and unemployment, as well as about the economic impact of international trade, influenced the policy debate of the day. He was the co-founder and President of the Aarhus School of Economics in 1946.  
 From 1948 to 1958, Köster served as a professor in the department of economics at the University of Chicago ( 1947–1960 ). He left the faculty to become a visiting professor in Stockholm in 1960, an arrangement which continues to this day. He died in 1965.

 He studied natural sciences at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences ( KNA ), graduated in botany, geology, zoology and mathematics from the Royal Veterinary School, Vorderenboek. In 1882 he won the post of professor of embryology and evolution at the zoology school in Amsterdam and in 1892, of zoology in the zoology school in Groningen. The Rooker-Fisher equation is named after him.  
 In 1892 he published a description of the fossils of the age of the Mousterian ( Jurassic ) taxa, co-author with Charles Lyell Fleming, who interpreted them to be representatives of human ancestors, based on the geological evidence of the Passeretjibbonian ( roughly between the Upper Cretaceous and Jurassic epoch ), Rooker's earliest fossil section, dated from the Triassic Period. Rooker, Fleming and Fleming believed that the fossil `` Pleuronectes '' was originally used by the early humans as an indicator for sex or relationship. In 1902 Fleming and Fleming presented to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences a catalogue of vertebrates discovered from these areas. In 1910 Rooker published an edition of their works which had first appeared in 1905. In 1920, in an article by Mendel Lieben in Naturalis Biologica, Rooker and Lieben estimated the age of most of the living and extinct mammal species ( known and named ) to be between 24 million and 24 million years old.

 = Matthias Teilhard (statistician) =  
Matthias Teilhard ( 25 October 1776 – 4 February 1837 ) was a German statistician, and the first professor at the University of Marburg.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Teilhard studied medicine at the University of Tübingen, at the same time teaching mathematics and natural philosophy at Marburg. Here he is considered to be the father of both mechanics and statistics.  
 In 1784 he obtained his PhD ( Doctoral thesis ) in Natural Philosophy from Tübingen. This allowed him to leave Marburg and institute his independent practice, which had started in 1768. In 1789 he became professor of natural philosophy at Marburg. As a school teacher, he stressed the importance of practical knowledge rather than technical education, and encouraged students to strive for merit instead of perfection.Teilhardian methods were developed at Marburg, and all major branches of mathematics and physics in Germany were founded on his methodology.

 = William John of Clarendon =  
William John of Clarendon FRSE ( 15 December 1825 – 19 December 1886 ) was an English meteorologist. He was the brother of Michael John of Clarendon ( 1818–1895 ) and brother of Robert John of Clarendon ( 17 June 1822 – 5 October 1892 ).  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 William John was born in Charleville, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Northampton College, and completed a degree in chemistry with degrees in 1836 and 1837. In 1845 he became an assistant at the observatory in Rome, and by 1870 was employed as a weather forecaster.  
 As a meteorologist, he was chiefly interested in atmospheric temperature, which involved meteorological observations made by meteorologists in all parts of the world. In 1856 he was sent by his brother Michael to Rome to study geophysics under Charles Scocco, examining the valleys and surface of the earth and the atmosphere as it shifted due to Earth rotation. This led him to the conclusion that the fine pressure difference between the seabed and the atmosphere causes the volume of the atmosphere to rise and fall, as the distance between the two lines of pressure changes with Earth's axis of rotation. On some such consideration he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1859. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1860, and of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1872. He served as the Secretary of the British Association for the Advancement of Science between 1877 and 1881. He was also awarded an Honorary Degree ( D.Sc. ) from Oxford University in 1884.

 = Jean Maria Delacroix =  
Jean Maria Delacroix, also known as Jean Robert, ( August 15, 1733, Saint-Algiers – 19 January 1797, Montpellier ) was a French French classical violinist, composer, and music educator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Delacroix was born at Saint-Cloud in 1621, the son of Jean Robert Delacroix and his wife Mme Laurer-Hébonne. When Delacroix was a boy, his father and mother suffered from some mental illness and he entered the Saint-Légion d'honneur. He graduated in music studies from the Ecole Normale and as a violinist was accompanied by Abbé Joseph Adolphe Vardin ( 1733–1809 ). In 1771, Delacroix moved to Paris and began his classical training. Delacroix graduated from the Conservatoire de Paris in 1773 and with the Saint-Légion d'Honneur, where he made his professional debut in 1782. Delacroix taught for three years at the Conservatoire before moving to Montpellier. He played with numerous composers and conductors, including Pierre Beaufort, Joseph Adolphe Vardin, and François Rondineau. In 1789, he returned to Paris, writing for a few months in Savoy and in the magazines Trésor et Ombre. In 1792, he married Agnes, a daughter of an insurance company in Montpellier. He became a frequent guest at the grand and ballet-like concerts of Rondineau and the future troubadour André Guy. He was well known as a virtuoso virtuoso and a musician and teacher. At the age of 38, Delacroix was appointed president of the Paris Philharmonic Orchestra, but he was replaced by the ophthalmologist Jean-Antoine Hebron ( 1747–1808 ). He was the author of a number of music works, such as the quintet Prose et Humoresque ( or : Two Pieces for the First Violin ), the Violoncello Quintet ( libretto by Jules Cauchy, Claude-Joseph Boéticq and Marcel Rameau, 4 vols., Paris, 1795 ), and the song `` Voyage dans l'imprende '' ( or : Picture from the Sea ).In 1787 Delacroix died of a fractured skull at the age of 58.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Delacroix composed several short pieces, several concertos, and several chamber music works, notably the Violoncello Quintet ( libretto by Jules Cauchy, Claude-Joseph Boéticq and Marcel Rameau, 4 vols., Paris, 1795 ), and the symphony in F minor ( libretto by Paul Collet ). It is said that he composed no symphonies. One of his works, the Violoncello Sonata ( libretto by Michel-François Menéjon, Jacques Matthieu and Jean Pierre Camus ), was presented to King George VI as a gift in 1795. Delacroix was also known for his operas, notably In the Forest ( libretto by Nicolas Louis ), In the Jungle ( libretto by Jean-François Henne ), I will come to the sea of wine ( libretto by Alfred Leland ), and Suzy ( libretto by Louis Pérubé ).

 = Jan Kepler (physicist) =  
Jan Kepler ( July 17, 1787 – July 3, 1858 ) was a Danish inventor of a device capable of producing highly infinitesimal amounts of electricity.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Denmark's Norden Archipelago. During his teenage years, he studied natural sciences at the University of Copenhagen. In 1817, he joined the Royal Danish Air Force and later became a pilot.  
 In 1821, he won a research prize from the government, for the invention of a motor and for the construction of a mercury thermometer for the British office-for-aids at the Royal Air Force in Copenhagen. He won the Norwegian Iron-nordische Mikroghadet of the year 1824, in 1826, and in 1830 was named a member of the Danish Academy of Sciences.  
 He investigated the phenomenon of thermal anomalies which caused lights, like candle-fires, to appear permanently on the ground.  
 In 1823, he designed and built a portable steam engine with a temperature-sensing tube.  
 His paper ( in Danish ) containing his experiments was `` Über der Thermünerstrahlen ''. He was not a natural scientist. In 1831, he introduced heat at low temperatures, which he felt was not reliable. He also discovered a vast array of anomalies, some of them occurring on the geological scale. As the summer cooled down the anomalies become more evident. He found a way to counteract this problem by installing a constant amount of electric current in a cooling tube that stretched between two adjacent supports, one supporting a heated tube. The hypothesis was that an accidental current passing through the tube would be enough to set off the heat-sensitive reaction.In 1834 he designed a type of thermometer, one which could be both accurate and reliable. In 1835, he built a large ammonia furnace which produced thermocouple emulsions in a vacuum chamber. By carefully separating these emulsions, he was able to measure a number of temperature changes. In this work, he also invented the first machine capable of accurately measuring the absolute degree of a temperature difference. This temperature-sensor apparatus was constructed by his colleague and friend Johannes Otto Janssen, who named the Janssen-Kepler machine after him.  
 In 1843 he was awarded the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died in Copenhagen on July 3, 1858. He is buried in the cemetery at Buansag.While producing a thermometer, J.E. Kepler was assisted in his research by Andreas Fick, the `` inventor of coffee ''.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 According to John Foch and Duncan Mackenzie, while he was researching thermal anomalies, he also `` found to his great satisfaction the workings of a steam engine, and in fact, of a kind of invention much more rapid than any yet discovered by means of electricity ''.  
 His experiments include one in which `` several piles of coal were continually put in motion, at random, for a given time... the engine nearly continually filled the furnace with the abundant fuel contained therein. '' His reaction time to the emitted pulses was a few milliseconds. At one point, his thermometer `` took a thousand seconds to climb from the vault of a chimney to the tail end of a burning log. '' The results of the experiments that he conducted ( e.g., the one in the engleaving chamber ) were subsequently published.  
 On the previous work was also published an early account of his discovery : `` This discovery, of a means of reproducing exactly the images of the lightings of a view-screen in any given glass, has, it is to be hoped, been discovered and will probably be of great practical utility in directing treatment and setting up of the apparatus employed for this purpose ''.  
 His paper, `` Über die Jetszrationdichtung über die Omeletkeit befinden '' ( 1830 ) was published in the `` Annalen der Naturforschenden '' ( a science journal in 1797 ), which mentioned his discovery of thermal anomalies and the Janssen-Kepler machine. It is published in our archives in 1886-88 ( see archives section ).

 = Karl Wilhelms =  
Karl Walther Martin Ludwig Wilhelms ( 10 April 1882 – 19 February 1972 ) was a German neuropathologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Wilhelms was born in Halle aß Eener, Saxony, Germany, the son of a physician who was a native of Lubeck. The university of Halle awarded him a degree of medicine in 1906. He graduated with a PhD under Joseph Goldschmidt in 1905 with an dissertation titled Der ältere folgende Derkugende der Brodhave und die Herrgesteine als die Planisphere im Schweiz und insbesondere der Schneegezte von die ihre Anatomie und der Gebiete der Neurogeschichte, in which he was also the recipient of a letter of recommendation from Josef Hübner.  
 In 1908 he returned to Halle, where in 1910 he became an assistant in a neurological clinic, a position he retained until his retirement in 1941. In 1928 he was named director of the neuropsychiatric institute in Schöneberg.  
 His career spanned several departments, including neurology, neurology and psychiatry, and he continued to work on the anatomical basis of dementia. He was also a psychobiologist who published a number of papers on the relationship of specific personality traits with neuronal processes.  
 He was deeply affected by the institutionalism of the Nazi regime in Germany, and later did not hesitate to express his displeasure with the conduct of medical doctors. Wilhelms described psychiatric illness as `` the poorest form of manhood ''.  
 Wilhelms died in Göttingen in 1972.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
   
   
 === Brain : anatomy, physiology, and pathology ===  
 Wilhelms ’ work concentrated on the anatomical basis of the brain and its connection with the nervous system. He studied the cerebral hemispheres : the ventricles, the pons, and the cerebral cortex.Although Wilhelms was an outspoken critic of pathological psychiatry, such as `` pathological psychology '' ( Poulantz Dasen et al. ), with which he had a professional conflict, he had a very strong affinity for neuropsychiatry. Wilhelms discussed with his student Raymond Wiedemann his views on neuropathology, commenting that “ there can be no disagreement as to the importance of the word neuropathology in the sense of a logical determination of physiological processes. ”  
   
   
 === Neurology ===  
 Wilhelms also discussed neurophysiology, studying ocular corneal reflexes, and superatomy. His laboratory work was devoted to the quantification of oxygen consumption and their association with visual sensitivity. In 1897 he was awarded the Verein für Neurologie und Physiologie zur Allgemeine Physiologie ( for one year ’ s assistance in comparative physiology ).In 1913, in the Autumn semester of this year, Wilhelms demonstrated for the first time that trigeminal nerves produced abnormal phototaxis in the eye, independently of the visual system ( Reich et al. ). In 1916, Wilhelms demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal and lingual nerves caused double vision. In 1918, as part of his practice, Wilhelms also performed neurochemical investigations on urea in the eye.  
   
   
 === Neuropsychology ===  
 Wilhelms contributed to a number of areas of neuropsychology. He completed a comprehensive textbook on motorogy and physiology of the human nervous system in the 1890s, with additional articles in a series of books and monographs on sheep brain. He also wrote a major article in 1894 entitled `` On the structure of the vegetative state, '' published as The Anatomy and Physiology of Consciousness in The New York World-Telegram.  
 Wilhelms coined the phrase `` misreading '' in neurology. He was an outspoken critic of the methodologies used by pathologists in their diagnosis of mental illness, and he viewed the current state of modern neuropsychiatry as having a progressive descent from a belief in innate, irreducible dissection.  
 Wilhelms coined the phrase `` in utero stroke '' in 1910.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Wilhelms died in Göttingen in 1972, apparently of leukemia.

 Wilson has been called `` the father of photomontage. '' He is also credited for popularizing the practice. He said, ``  
   
 It started when he had to go to the United States to do the commercial photography for F.O. Goodman, the secretary. The magazine called, and F.O. said he was on his way to China. He was expecting the photographer to show it to him. But he showed it to me... in one of these smaller rooms [... ] it started giving me a really special idea of how people were making it happen. It was like a community where you could get lost in the atmosphere and see some of the best work coming out of the room. ''

 = Victor Şerbat =  
Victor Čerbat ( Slovene : [ ˈveːrˈbɛːt ] ; 5 January 1913 – 15 July 2003 ) was a Slovene politician and economist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Victor Čerbat was born in Šarina Gavrilović, where he became a teacher and administrator. He married fellow politician Sofia Kralj in 1942 and the two later had children. At the time of his death, Čerbat was the Liberal Democratic People's Republic's Minister of Trade and Information, where he was mainly responsible for attracting foreign investment and support for large infrastructure projects, the creation of development banks and the establishment of banks owned by the state. He also presided over the state-owned Oil and Gas Development Corporation, which was subsequently privatized in 2000.In 1965, during World War II, the Social Democratic Party ( SDSR ) of Čerbat's country, the Workers'Party ( DA ) of “ Lenin ”, collaborated with the communist international communist group, the International Communist Organization ( ICI ) to construct the Socialist Development Bank. This second bank provided a solution to the country's debt crisis and other international problems, which Čerbat was also responsible for overseeing.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Čerbat's career in government and politics was characterized by a strong element of reformism. He was a critic of social welfare programs, aimed at reducing poverty and reducing the country's dependence on imports. The more successful Čerbat's efforts were, the more inclined the government was to promote the socialist agenda. Since Čerbat had been elected twice to parliament, this meant his influence was not limited to the Social Democratic and Workers'Party ( DA ), but also included other left-wing parties such as the Social Democratic MHD and the Social Democratic Left ( then the Social Democratic Left–Inna Borjoučka ), both of which were smaller and often unaligned. Together with fellow Slovene politician Sofia Kralj, they pushed the construction of the Development Bank, initiated by the government. The total amount spent on the bank ranged from $ 10 million to $ 12 million between its inception in 1966 and its closure on 30 September 1997. Čerbat served as deputy chairman of the Senate of the People's Republic of Slovenia from 1965 to 1968. He was also the executive chairman of the Development Council ( 1977–1979 ) and a member of the Central Economic Commission ( 1982–1986 ).  
 Čerbat was also a liberal activist, a professor of economic affairs at the Slovenian Academy of Sciences. In 1963, he helped found the Slovenian Regional Information and Guidance Center for Development ( MIZEL ). At that time, Čerbat was also the head of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences, an academic power with an extensive ministry. Čerbat was also the prime mover behind a common public welfare policy.  
   
   
 == Honors ==  
 In 1964, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Čerbat received the National Labor Certificate from President Lyndon Johnson. He also received the U.S. Government ’ s Medal of Freedom in 1978.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Čerbat married Sofia Kralj in 1942. After the divorce of Kralj and the children, Victor Čerbat had a son and two daughters. In 1990, he was elected president of the SDSR, a party co-founded by one of his children and served for three terms.

 = Mikhail Grigoryevich Churkin =  
Mikhail Grigoryevich Churkin ( Russian : Никола́й Приборникович Азбриков ; 20 August 1852, Stalingrad – 26 July 1917, Moscow ) was a Soviet designer and illustrator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 In 1865, Churkin started studying the ancient trade inscriptions in Moscow. His study of Russian inscriptions began the design of several books and magazines, which he made with the help of engravers and assistants, including Pavel August Wilhelm Lopatin. By the time he died in 1917, he had received over 50 works. He is one of the leading figures of the tradition of Russian engraving. A famous landscape in Old Russia, for example, is a work in his style. The unique window on his own bookshop is considered a masterpiece of Russian art and was dedicated to Alexander Nevsky. The window is commemorated with the slogan of his motto.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
   
 Churkin has taken an interest in the meaning of traditional designs and influenced designers in the Soviet Union and abroad. Although he was one of the first to understand the value of designing `` Greek in the design of the world '' ( see Atlantico ), he was not interested in connecting it with what were regarded as frivolous design trends, although there is great importance in the recent fascination with modernism in Russia. He expressed his own desire for an aesthetic harmony between his traditional and the modern.Churkin's main aim was always to bring back the `` Greek idea '', while preserving the purity of the old styles.  
 As a `` modern '' artist, he was influenced by the increasing sophistication of nature and its fine quality of quality of the skin, especially the textile. He always thought about the appearance of the work, thought about color, and wanted to make works using realistic methods, and utilized material minimisation.These sensibilities shaped his views on the values of the masculine and feminine form in visual art. Churkin was conscious of the need to show a distinctive beauty in everyday life, and opposed the ideal of `` a colour palette '' to the kind of `` an all-pervasive, monochrome regime '' which characterized the aesthetic of romanticism. In comparison with the classics of his time, he experimented with creating beautiful typography with minimalistic character - closer to his own and the preferred style of the day.Churkin called for `` harmony between the product and the designer '', and favored minimalism, sensuality and objectivity. His inclination toward the classical orientation is reflected in his influential book Elements of Textile Design ( 1916 ). The book was a necessary preface for the book publications by Art and Architecture and Conceptual Paper with selected drawings and texts of various clients.  
   
   
 == Honors ==  
 Among the many publications by his name is the series The Gardenia or The Heart of Russia ( 1935 ).  
 A couple of sports-game baskets with his artwork were created by the developers of the ENS KVET hockey team.  
 A chandelier made of Churkin's drawings and watercolors is in the ENS collection in Moscow.  
 Several galleries in the Moscow RIAM exhibit His and Hers for the exhibition of Oriental painting on the walls of the exhibition gallery Churkin Gallery.  
 In 1989, UNESCO adopted the international name of `` Churkin '' as a tribute to its authors and designers, and awarded him the `` USSR prize in the history of the arts ''.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Churkin's was an acclaimed figure in modern Russian art. His works from that period are popular with his younger generation, but he is still only an icon of his influence. His publishing works are mostly in the pattern-making and form-making area, and at the time of his death they had an enormous market value. His designs have been used as a reference for very long time.

Charlotte Patterson ( February 26, 1915 – September 15, 2006 ) was an American psychologist known for her `` landmark '' publication, the article, `` Can Injuries Causally Influence Psychological Responses? ''.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Charlotte Patterson was born in Nashville, Tennessee on February 26, 1915, to Naomi and George Patterson. She was an only child. In 1916, Charlotte was sent by her mother to live with her maternal grandparents. After a brief period in France with her grandmother, Charlotte went on to complete elementary school in Garden City, New York.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At age 17, Charlotte Patterson graduated from the University of New York with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.Patterson began studying clinical psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago where she enrolled in graduate school under the supervision of Dr. M. Alan Lashley. Patterson was subsequently hired by the Chicago Psychological Clinic as a clinical assistant to Dr. Mary Ellis. Patterson worked at the clinic until the discovery of her writing interests. Shortly after arriving, she published the first of two doctoral dissertations, `` Can Injuries Causally Influence Psychological Responses? '' in the Bulletin of the New York Institute of Psychology ( BOIP ), the Journal of General Psychology. The BOIP “ unashamedly embraces the notion that [ subjectivity ] is mostly a response to social conditions ” and that “ the self is [ essentially ] a constituted feature of a species. ” Patterson was hired by the International Foundation for the Study of Learning and working closely with Isabelle Epstein.  
 Patterson left Chicago after four years to work as an assistant psychologist at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan.Patterson's work in neurology, cognitive psychology, and education, which would lead to her appointment as a faculty member at the International Humanist and Ethical Union ( IHEU ), was of particular interest. In the course of her work at the IHEU, Patterson's doctoral research took her into the South and gave her a unique understanding of African Americans and their psychology, particularly their educations. The results of her research were frequently credited with guiding Patterson to establish a relationship with Young-Hemingway.

 Patterson became interested in the theories of Charles Wood Hye and developed an interest in mass psychology. Patterson became interested in African American psychology as she read the books of Dr. William James H. Gleason, who was an American pioneer of American psychology, and the studies of Dr. Joy Freeman Brinkley, who developed the Gray behaviorism concept and helped pioneer public school English. Patterson was particularly interested in the theories of American criminologist Lothrop Stoddard and her work as well as her peer Mary E. Ellis. She formed a rapport with Lothrop Stoddard, who in her later life would develop many of the conceptualizations that would become known as `` functionalism ''. Patterson felt strongly that individual differences could not be equated to the collective concepts of 'root causes '. For Patterson, talent and the opportunity to meet others had significant importance in shaping our perception of life. In a 1997 speech, Patterson shared her motivations for writing the essay, `` Can Injuries Causally Influence Psychological Responses? ''.

 = John Elliot (chef) =  
John Elliot ( 17 March 1748 – 10 May 1803 ) was an English gardener, noted for founding the Otley Garden in Wood Green in 1801.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Elliot was born at St. James's, The Dowager de Grange, Kent, the son of James Elliot, M.P., MP, and Mary earther, daughter of Michael Andrew, esq. of Moreton, Hertfordshire. After completing his training as a priest, he took up a post as tutor to the Rev. Edward Rich, vicar of Witheshire, and succeeded him in 1791. In 1798 he was appointed to his church's high council. He moved to Fulham in the autumn of 1798, where he enjoyed a prolonged employment as a preacher of The Catholic Church.  
   
   
 == Reformation ==  
 Elliot's ministers in England refused to adopt the radical theological views of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a charge which he was eventually called to answer. However, a proposal for radical reform in the Church was mounted in London in 1796. A meeting of priests was convened in 1805, with Elliot taking an active part in the debating, from which his influence was to last for over fifty years. In 1802 he was elected one of the founding members of the Liberal Club of London, which later took the nickname `` Green Elephants ''. He was also a member of the English Conservatory in Amsterdam, and took part in the execution of William Shakespeare's Macbeth.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Eminent writers in his time, Elliott translated the Bible, the Bible of the Hebrews, and the Psalms into the English language. He also published Sacred Sketches of the Sacred Tongues, and numerous hymns, verses, and prose compositions. His magnum opus, being an enlarged version of the Old Testament, he issued, though in bad taste, in two vols. at Salisbury in 1799, and again at L'Artois in 1808. He also wrote in Hebrew, Esau and David ; his best known translation is entitled Your Life in Its Relation to the Birth of Jesus. Many of his works were published in London ; he is said to have been one of the earliest engravers to render engravings of pre-historic characters in newspapers and pamphlets.  
 Elliott produced the following hymns :  
   
'The flower of Lebanon,'‘ Jerusalem and Phoenicia : Grace given in their mission' 
'The Sun,'‘ the Sun on Gassa  
'Love at first sight,'' Holy Monks, Jesus on Giacomo Stamperia  
'Through Lebanon and for the King ','The Holy Oak ', Glory blessed as in the Holy of Holies.  
'By way of saving Grace,'' Do Thou, O Prince of Darkness, give all hearts his spirit in our now forlorn hope, that thou mayest always renew Thy House, and abide thus, O King, and remain always on earth ', The Lord of the Worlds.  
'Away with the evil ',  
'Those parts that, in their strength, strengthen' 
'With Shrivel it appears to grow,''The Word that casts off all falsehood ','Holy John's Passion.Elliot was a practising Jew, the son of Benjamin Elliot, the first Lord Mayor of London. His brother, David Elliot, wrote a tract against the Nestorians, which he afterwards published under the title I.S. Hunt's Attempt'Against the Nestorians.

 = Arthur Tanabe =  
Arthur Tanabe ( 植田 平, Atsuwa, September 13, 1917 – March 19, 1997 ) was a Japanese molecular biologist and selenium researcher known for his work on this compound.Tanabe studied chemistry at the Tokyo Imperial University. In 1928 he began work on selenium gas. He invented a solvent extraction method for the extraction of selenium and improved the technique. After his initial extraction, he isolated `` 疾合重 '', or `` platinum from selenium '', later known as selenium oxide. He is particularly noted for the X-ray emission from selenium, which he produced by using a single piece of aqueous oxygenated ferric chloride solution. His name became associated with this substance in 1937 and since then is known widely as `` Tango ''.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Tanabe was born in Niigata to a teacher and a janitor. After a severe illness, he transferred to Niigata University School of Medicine ( now Hosei University ) in 1931, and served as a researcher there from 1930 until 1946. In 1946 he was admitted to a university research group. He began work as a research worker in mass spectrometry in 1946. In 1949 he started teaching at the university in Yokohama, where he became a senior fellow from 1951 to 1955. In 1955, he joined the newly founded Science and Technology Institute at Tokushima, Tokyo. From 1956 to 1963 he was a professor at Hosei University. He retired in 1964 and was awarded the Iwanami Reki Mitsui Prize in 1971.  
 After Tanabe's death in 1997, scientists and researchers who worked in the field were kept up to date with the latest developments in the field, as well as the customary honors and awards given to Tanabe's students.The majority of the work Tanabe worked on was in the field of chemical synthesis. He is the namesake of aseptiform alga belonging to the sea anemone family, which, after a lengthy phase transition, once again became a type of phytoplankton.  
 The identification of the X-ray emission from Tanabe's X-ray diffraction data in the late 1950s sparked interest in the role of X-rays in life. Apart from his work on X-ray emission, Tanabe developed a novel technique for the extraction of selenium and, in 1958, developed a leach-resistant ultraviolet-visible ( LDV ) analyzer that was subsequently used by several large companies worldwide.

Bjarne Breslau ( 11 February 1871 – 15 November 1950 ) was a Danish mathematician, who worked on number theory.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Copenhagen, the youngest son of King Christian IX and his second wife Louise Orgaarde Breslau ( née Kristian ). In 1896 he enrolled in the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1913 with an honours degree in mathematics. His teachers were A. E. L. Friesen, Pierre Laffont and the famous mathematician John von Neumann. While at Copenhagen, he was influenced by the ideas of Leavis, whose initial influence he recognized in other students. He received a doctorate from Copenhagen in 1915. In 1916 he returned to the University of Copenhagen, but remained a teaching assistant. As a result of his knowledge of probability theory, he was put in charge of the department of mathematical statistics in 1919. His main research area was the development of the system of Copenhagen summators for finding the sums of the sums of complex numbers. In 1926, he joined Niels Hartog at Copenhagen, and became a professor of mathematical statistics there in 1931. His major contribution was to the theory of binomial distributions and linearities, which were important contributions for algebraic number theory and fundamental for the foundations of mathematical statistics. The phase function is known as the Breslau–Hartog function. For a sample of its applications, see his cyclic permutation theorem.

 = Albert Wendel =  
Albert Wendel ( January 18, 1889 – April 20, 1979 ) was an American entomologist. He was director of the entomology research group of the Leduc County Naturalists'Museum from 1923 to 1933. Wendel was Professor of Entomology and Director of the Leduc County Naturalists'Museum from 1933 until his retirement in 1933, when the school was purchased by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Albert Wendel was born in Austin, Texas, the son of Albert Edward Wendel and Helen Mary Pearl Brown. His parents both held some kind of public office. He graduated from the University of Chicago and University of Texas, where he earned a master's degree in entomology in 1931.  
 In 1931, he was the first to collect the western species of the genus Astroturroidae in the Entomological Museum of Illinois. Wendel was employed as a curator of field entomology for the Leduc County Naturalists'Museum until 1933. In the summer of 1933, in response to reports of rapid, economic development in the area, the Leduc County Naturalists'Museum was purchased by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under the direction of Emmett C. Hutchinson.  
 In 1934, Wendel, who was working as a plant entomologist at the Leduc County Naturalists'Museum, initiated the multi-year series of field trips through Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri to survey a region of up to 100,000 acres of prairie land. From 1936 to 1938, the expedition included an experimental section along the Missouri River in which museum scientists experimented with field corn. Throughout the third of the year, the expedition also explored the Central Pacific Ocean.  
 In 1939, Wendel returned to the Leduc County Naturalists'Museum with several new species of the insects. The specimens were for identification by anatomy, taxonomy, and standard naming.  
 In 1941, Wendel was transferred to Chicago to be full-time curator of field entomology at the Natural History Museum of Chicago. He continued his field work with D. F. Hall and Allen W. Nichols. During his time there, he met his wife, Augusta, an ornithologist who was equally fascinated by natural history. With the outbreak of World War II in 1941, the Museum was attacked by Japanese bomb-carriers and The War Scare forced the museum to close, leaving the plant section unoccupied.  
 During the period 1935-1945, the Wendel Laboratory was destroyed by fires that caused extensive damage to the insect collection and his offices.During the course of the War Scare, Wendel arranged to have employees arrested for espionage by the United States government. He was arrested and sent to prison. He was released on February 1, 1945, by President Truman. After his release, Wendel was again offered a position with the Chicago Zoological Gardens as head of their entomology department. Wendel spent four years at the Zoological Gardens, this time teaching the first course in entomology, at the expense of his habilitation. He remained on the Zoological Gardens staff until 1947, when he was promoted to associate professor. Wendel served as head of the entomology department until his retirement in 1933.

 = Emil Drzywka =  
Emil `` Maud '' Drzywka ( German : [ ˈmuːdeː ] ; December 27, 1922 – March 4, 2005 ) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and teacher who was one of the best known and most admired figures of the late-19th-century American jazz and choral music movement. Drzywka was a member of the major jazz duos La Monte Young ( manager/composer ) and Dizzy Gillespie and the jazz group Sonny and Cher, and was the head of the jazz section of the DuPage Symphony Orchestra.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Emil Drzywka was born in Dubna, Poland, the youngest of five children. Drzywka had an older brother and sister who died before him ; his younger brothers, Igor and David ( also pianists ), later became notable jazz musicians as well. His parents were Lubna Aleksandrovna ( née Grad ), a Lithuanian born Polish-American singer, and Stasz Grigory Poikil. He was the second son of a Polish high school teacher, who was also an American citizen. Emil began playing the piano at five years of age, playing chamber music and conducting at age six and by the age of 14 he was playing professionally. As a composer, Drzywka composed songs and music for piano, orchestral music, and chamber music. From 1933 to 1946, he studied at the Juilliard School under composer and composer Andrew Mungus, earning his degree in 1943. He then moved to New York City with his family to join the Chicago Orchestra under its newly established conductor, Robert Cray, where he became known as `` one of the greatest keyboardists in the world. '' His time as a student was punctuated by some of the most intense instrument competitions in the history of jazz. In 1944, he received a PhD in Music Theory from the Juilliard School.  
 Drzywka moved to Philadelphia to work for two years as a music critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer, where he composed and conducted works for jazz audiences. He studied on his own in the Chicago Jazz and Choral Schools, in 1946 when he was appointed chief conductor of the DuPage Symphony Orchestra ( by then one of the nation's most successful orchestras ).  
 After leaving DuPage in 1949, Drzywka worked for the New York City Opera Orchestra ( DDOU ) where he was head of chamber music from 1958 until his retirement in 1973. He remained in New York City until his death. Drzywka's music, as it pertained to jazz, popular music, and choral music, was highly regarded in the field, being most widely performed by composers in the United States during his lifetime. He received numerous awards from various academic and professional organizations, including fellowships and awards, including the Ralph Vaughan Williams College's Jackson Prize and the Terence Tennant Award from the Juilliard School. In 1967, he was awarded the Olivier Award by the International Society of Composers and Authors for his design of The Willy Wonka. His opera Dolly Wonder was premiered in Chicago in January 1968. He was also known for his professional piano teaching at the famed John Muir Jazz Club in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  
 Drzywka died in Houghton, Massachusetts, on March 4, 2005. He was interred at Highwood Cemetery in Houghton, Massachusetts.

 He studied childhood personalities and later relationships. In his essays, some of which appear in The Clinical Journal of Adult Development and between the Erotic and the Symbolic, he explores psychoanalysis's work as a `` black art '' that can be studied and a path to understanding when someone wants to become `` male or female ''. He said, `` Even children, young or old, who do not want to be children at all... can indeed be trained to identify as boys or girls, and remain so.... The problem is always to recognize this as a clinical reality and then devise effective ways to change that young person's relationships so that he or she can be one with the mother and father, and with all children, which can be done in a very brief, peaceful, loving and rewarding way ''.

 = Louis Richard Lewis =  
Louis Richard Lewis ( May 18, 1927 – May 19, 2007 ) was an American statistician and statistician who pioneered the use of two measures of population growth, estimated bases of population growth and total fertility rate, for identifying the size of populations, which ultimately led to the abandonment of the metric of `` number of lives '' in the subsequent 20th century.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born on May 18, 1927 in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, a civil engineer, was a pioneer of communication and traffic technology who was best known for his own invention of the telephone. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1955. He was a founder of the American Statistical Association and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was the Lawrence H. Hoover Professor of Statistics at Johns Hopkins University from 1967 until his retirement in 1995.  
 Lewis and Douglas Wolf in 1989 used the new Universal Report on Demography ( URD ) to identify the United States as the world's largest population producer, with the U.S. continuing to grow at approximately two times the rate of the world population. The revised URD's successor, the World Population Prospects Survey ( WPPS ) was completed in 2007 and published in 2013.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1961, Lewis became a Research Associate with the United States Army and later in 1965 he was a Professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He was a founding member of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ( IISAA ) and its predecessor, the International Population Division of the Rockefeller Foundation.  
 At the IISAA, Lewis was an early advocate for greater flexibility in combining population estimates and series of tables to get a `` relative '' measure of a population's size.  
 For one of his earlier contributions to the growth of the United States population, he showed that the world was rapidly growing on average by 0.008 percent per year from 1961 to 1965. While this is less than the 0.2 percent needed to keep pace with its population growth ( a lack of '' real '' growth '' in the 1970s helped stall the last decade of progress, according to many scholars ), it is at least 2 times faster than what was needed to keep pace with the changing nature of climate.  
 He has also argued for large scale over-simplification of data because this essentially disregards and ignores the sources of `` inefficient '' growth.  
 He served on the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.The MacDowell Chalmers Award is named after Lewis.

Gottlieb Stiftung von Nyzelmann ( 30 March 1809 – 10 January 1885 ) was a German geologist, professor of mineralogy at the Universities of Göttingen and Leipzig.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
 Born in Görlitz ( now Görzfeld ), he studied at Leipzig and Göttingen, and then in 1860 married Freya Schofield.The University of Leipzig first conferred on him the doctorate of mineralogy, but he died before obtaining it, leaving no successor. In 1862, at the suggestion of Dr. Peierls ( 1810–1896 ) and at the invitation of Professor Holwerde ( 1811–1894 ), he established a mineralogical lab at Göttingen. At Göttingen he was the teacher of Professor Friedrich von Scheifel ( 1807–1896 ), and learned from him the methods of observation and the cultivation of lignite and other minerals.  
 Among his discoveries was that several alkaline elements ( particularly magnesium-25 and potassium-77 ) may be obtained by taking a cut ( or splitter ) of magnesium and potassium, both of which form, according to this view, two groups of elements which could not be identified apart by their characteristic separation. The  
 magenta and orange elements were named after him by scientific men ; by R.H. Nordgren ( 1848 ), by Edmond Domnaud ( 1863 ), and by Samuel Silberman ( 1873 ), respectively. In 1869, he named an alkaline element after him : Au. After his death the term `` geologist '' was applied to the mineral manganese-45Rb by G. van den Berg.

 = Henry Charles Nolan =  
Henry Charles Nolan ( March 25, 1836 – February 7, 1918 ) was an American astronomer. His name is sometimes attributed to Henry Charles Garrett Nolan, an early student of Dante Alighieri. In contrast to Garrett Nolan's progressive views, Nolan supported racial tolerance.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Henry Charles Nolan was born in New Haven, Connecticut on March 25, 1836, the son of a Methodist pastor. While a child, he attended Yale and continued at Yale University, where he received an education in mathematics and physics. While attending Yale, he corresponded with, and corresponded with, prominent artists including Alexander Calder, Blake, and Gifford Pinchot.He began his scientific career at Yale, where he received his doctorate in meteorology in 1850. He held a position at the Wesleyan Observatory in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1850, and served in that post until 1852.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 In 1854, Nolan was the author of `` The Astronomical Habits of British Birds '' ( edited by Richard Arthur Wood ). In the same year, he delivered a lecture to the Virginia Academy of Sciences on `` First Principles in Geometrical Astronomy ''. His paper, `` On the Present Position of the Sun in Solar Numerical Tables '', was reprinted in the Proceedings of the Virginia Academy of Sciences in 1856. His treatise on the classification of the `` local motion '', `` The Calculation of the Earth's Distances '', was in 1857 the starting point of speculation on the basis of two ten-year runs.  
 In 1861, Nolan was elected as an adjunct professor of meteorology and astronomy at Boston College, where he remained until his death in 1918. He lectured at Wesleyan in New York City from 1864 to 1868, and New York University in 1865–1867. He was the author of a second edition of his work on celestial mechanics and variations and problems in harmony.  
 His major work, published posthumously, is `` A Select Atlas of Universal and Celestial Motion '' ( 1878 ), which incorporates some of Nolan's original observations and computations as it pertained to local and local variations of the Sun's position. In it, Nolan describes the aspects of celestial motion discussed in the Introduction to `` The Elements of the Physical Theory of Celestial Motion, '' both general and local. The introduction states that `` Young and technical readers may desire to improve upon, as far as possible, the Principles of This Illustrious Work by the addition of the following valuable notes. To obtain an idea of the extent and urgency of the novelty... I have left in the revised edition the propositions originally advanced in the Preface... ''

 Glikson was born in Truro, New Brunswick, to Frank Harold and Ada Chahine Glikson. He was the grandson of John B. and Elizabeth Glikson. Glikson went on to study at the University of Manitoba, graduating with a degree in botany. After completing his studies, he worked at the Winnipeg Botanical Gardens as an assistant curator until 1932, when he married the celebrated biologist Ida Rebecca Mead.Glikson's work made him known in botanical circles as `` a champion in the experimental work that showed that plant viruses are being evolved by fungal mechanisms to assist microbial life as it grows, as well as other viruses ''. His work was being credited with demonstrating that viruses may in fact act in a similar way to the active ingredient in tobacco smoke, flavoring the plant with flavin. Following this work, Andrew Mead joined him to work on the bio-directives of the plant viruses that are referred to as shigella and vesicular stomatitis. He also began work on viruses that were a part of the re-establishing of the germ plasm of Archaea. For the final years of his life, Glikson's laboratory was dedicated to biological research, which included plant viruses, studying the mechanism of protists and algae in living cells, and studying viruses that are infected with pathogens such as influenza and adenovirus. This work led to the translation of Glikson's hypothesis that viruses do not become extinct by chance but by active intervention of the cell and its environment.  
 He died of a heart attack on October 21, 1952, in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

He was born at Utrecht, and studied geology and mineralogy at the universities of Jena, Leipzig and Berlin. In 1852 he was made an associate professor, and in 1858 a full professor, of mineralogy and geology at Leiden University.  
 His original research focused on the paleozoic rocks of southern Europe. He was mainly interested in the Carboniferous rocks, which he describes as composed mostly of SiO2. His studies of fossils on the lower Nosedine from the Dutch East Indies helped him to correlate the gravels with the Petrography, which then was mainly concerned with radiometric dating of rocks. For his field work on the Geology of the Sea Waters, which is essentially a study of the mineralogy of the sand, he made a permanent fieldstation at Vingetendingen in the Dutch East Indies, where he had taken a boat, and stayed there for five years to study the geology of these waters.Oort died in Bonn, aged 59.

 = Herbert Smuts =  
Herbert Smuts ( November 2, 1902 – January 6, 1967 ) was an American plant physiologist. He was a pioneer in the field of plant physiology and the subsequent study of traits of flowering plants. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Distinguished Service Award in 1934, and in 1940 he was awarded the Ivar Laakson Award of the International Society for Phytogeography and Botany. Smuts studied at Cornell University, where he was one of the leaders of the Department of Botany.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Smuts was born on November 2, 1902, in Auburn, Michigan, the son of Gustave W. Smuts and Mary Anne DeLand. He attended Smith College, graduating summa cum laude in 1923, but soon began research at the request of the college's botanist, Ralph Eaton.In 1926, Smuts moved to Washington, D.C. where he remained until 1930. There, he researched and conducted pioneering research on the physiology of leaf development. His interest in the physiology of flowers led to his work with William C. McCarthy. The relationship between his research and the study of female plants led to the creation of the Marvin Smuts Ornithology Laboratory at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Throughout his career, Smuts worked with many notable plant physiologists, including Richard J. Pollak, Tom Tholey, J. Robert Thurber, Leonard Harmon, Harold H. King, and Jack Bland. Smuts became the head of the Plant Physiology Department at the University of California, Berkeley.  
 In 1955, he became a Distinguished Service Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained until his death. As an academic, he has been praised for his development of foundational research in the fields of physiology and the study of flowering plants. He had numerous scientific publications published during his career, including many papers published in the Annals of Botany, the American Journal of Botany, the Botanical Papers, and the Journal of Phytogeography.  
   
   
 == Selected writings ==  
 Based on the work of Ruth Burdon and Edgar Mitchell, he made contributions in the following fields :  
   
 When I crossed the world with my four-inch ( 10-cm ) long brush, Dorothy Whitcomb Gordon wrote of him :  
 [ E ]ach moment of color blurring did his world shrink, not only to a pleasure-cost estimate, but also to a total one-dimensional perspective.  
   
 Smuts published the first two papers related to a widespread `` Long-ornate '' cabbage. In that paper, Smuts reported the study of the morphological characteristics of the loess of California, emphasizing the similarities in the leaves and fur of the cultivated and wild varieties. An earlier paper by him and Mark E. Michelson on leaf development from the New Jersey Ironworkers'Cattle series suggested a structure in the leaves and the leaf veins that accounted for the appearance of the different loess forms. In the second paper, Smuts described the pattern in spring ( May–June ) in China and India of leaf veins forming before the leaves even form.Smouts found evidence of root-cap acorns in some North American species. He and Walter Brainerd found the genus Acacia as well. Along with Paul M. Albrecht, Heinemann, and L. S. Mark, he co-authored the book Annotated Plants of Northern Mexico, a valuable reference book in botany.

 = Louis Agas =  
Louis Agas ( c.1590, Risolu, Nijmegen – 1621, Delft ) was a Dutch Jesuit and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was the brother of Reinhold Agas. He was born in Rouen on 4 September 1590, the son of Conrad Agas ( 1560–1621 ), a minister, and Magdalen Anne Maatheleen Maria Gautier ( 1574–1656 ). His brother became the Provincial of Delft in 1586, where he settled until his death. Louis Agas was the younger brother of Reinhold Agas and was named its successor as deputy chaplain in the Jansenist Dutch Province of Zerbst as well as the Protestant and some Calvinist ministers who lived in the area. Reinhold died on 13 March 1604. Louis, who was then eight years old, died at the age of nineteen in the house of the pastor, Count Dostercko. He had been married in 1599 to Magdalen Beelden, an amateur astronomer who had little knowledge of astronomy. After the death of the father, Magdalen produced his son Ferdinand Agas and appointed him to succeed the elder Agas in Delft. The name Agas was introduced by John Cannans ( 13th century, Dutch East India Company ), and was adopted by Protestants around the world.  
 After moving to Delft, Louis contracted apoplexy in 1600 and died on 27 July 1621.  
 He left his vast knowledge and his valuable collections of minerals, plants, and other antiquities to the University of Delft, and was also the instigator of the first systematic theology courses. Agas is commemorated in the scientific names of several organisms, including a genus of bacteria, Coccidura agasicus, named in his honour.  
 He is known for his assistance with the establishment of a canal in Delft, near Vondelampen, about 1400-1300 A.D. This was named the Louis Agas Canal.

 While at the University of Athens he was elected a member of the Academy of Science ( 1928 ) and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( 1948 ).  
 In 1929, as a result of reforms introduced by the National Assembly of the Republic, he was appointed president of the Section on General Theory and Methods of Algebra and Matrices, a position that he held until 1961.  
 Vavrilakis's doctoral thesis dealt with symmetry extension in Fourier series, in particular, its relation to the model theory for regular Lie groups. In his last thesis, he applied the differential geometry of geodesics to the definition of moduli spaces for the 6-tuples in G-dimensional space. In 1936 he returned to Athens to work at the College of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.

Marcello Toula Cavallari ( 29 August 1859 – 20 December 1933 ) was an Italian Roman Catholic cardinal, mathematician, and physicist, one of the most important Roman Catholic scientists in Europe.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Cavallari was born to a political family in Naples, Italy. He was the oldest of three children. His father, de la Pollazzi, was a scientist of early technical renown, and was superintendent of the Villa Piacenza Observatory in the Transylvania region of Italy. He was a member of the Academy of Sciences.  
 At the age of eighteen he applied to join the staff of the La Scala Observatory. He studied astronomy at the University of Naples under the leadership of Augustin Petrarca.  
   
   
 == Saint-Malo Observatory ==  
   
 In 1884, Cavallari was appointed professor of astronomy at the newly established Saint-Malo Observatory in Montopoli, Italy. He became principal of the observatory in 1899, was named director in 1904, and became its chairman in 1908. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1909.Cavallari was closely associated with the so-called `` Martino School '' of Galactomic physics, with Alexandre Tarski, Mihai Martino, André Breughel and Francesco de Vito. He was the first to point out the quasi-permanent phenomenon that occurs when a charged electron moves past the nucleus of an atomic nucleus : the spin-orbit transition. He laid the foundations for the development of the phenomenon.  
 Cavallari provided the theoretical foundation for the results of development of supersonic propulsion and its application to ships and aircraft.Toula Cavallari also established and guided the Visse airship company that built its first aviation service from 1887 to 1921. He wrote many books on the subjects of mathematics, physics and astronomy, which helped to popularize the subject. He was also one of the first European promoters of magnetoelectricity.

 == Biography ==  
 Masare Kajimura was born on March 4, 1863, in the town of Haruo in Shizuoka Prefecture. His father, Masanobu Kajimura, was the director of the Shizuoka Imperial Imperial Museum. His mother was teacher Misawa. He started elementary school at the age of 6. During his education, he became a regular pupil of Iwatani Moriko ( 1855-1910 ) and one of the few girls among the many students of Moriko.  
 When Moriko, who had also taken classes under Iwatani, died in 1894, the following year, she provided the inheritance to Masare. After studying history and foreign languages at the University of Tokyo from 1905 to 1906, he received a degree in Oriental languages and culture in 1907 from the University of Tokyo, where he later received a doctorate in the same year.During this time, Masare was researching the distribution of the red toad Darcochelys bicolor at Daegu. Because of his association with Moriko, as well as the fact that he is also a descendant of Murakami himself, he was granted honorary citizenship by the Kingdom of Japan in 1910, the same year as the 100th anniversary of the death of Murakami. He obtained his second official citizenship in the year 1913.  
 Because of his newfound position at the Imperial Museum, he began to teach native language classes in Japanese. In 1916, he married the English-speaking Helen Lorraine Hall, daughter of historian Thomas Hall.  
 He was a student of Masunaga Keitarō ( 1836-1912 ), and made Japanese trips to China to see and investigate the composition and evolution of the yan yan trees. He also became a student of Vohda Takao ( 1855-1910 ) and Adolf Leibniz ( 1859-1912 ). During his career, he made about 70 trips to Korea. In 1927, he was appointed director of the Museum and started working there as the Museum's director. In 1927, he founded a course in Japanese history with Osuki Manako.

 == Life and career ==  
 Josiah Sterkel was born at Hammersmith in London. He was educated at the Gresham's School and University of London, receiving his B.A. in 1776. He was ordained and proceeded to preach as a pastor at various places and of the theological faculty at Essex, before entering the ministry of the parish of Midlothian in 1782. He was a correspondent of Edward P. Howe, in New Zealand and the West Indies, and also took part in the unsuccessful British colonization of New South Wales, but after leaving the ministry of Midlothian became the vicar at the newly founded Blackburne ( now Stratford-upon-Avon ) church, where he was the reverend rector from 1807 to 1811. He resigned the parishionery in 1821, and devoted himself to the study of natural history. During his long life he published over 150 papers on rhinoceros breeding, and also on two species of woolly rhinoceros, a native of Africa, Leptodes scapensis.  
 While his scientific works are still being edited Sterkel had a considerable influence on the fashionable philosophy of his day. He was the first person to view the natural history of a rhinoceros from the point of view of the fundamental biology of the animal.A bronze bust of Sterkel can be seen in the Royal Institution of Great Britain Museum in the Royal Society Box, opened in 1994.

 = Eugene L. Clarke =  
Eugene Maxwell Clarke ( February 19, 1913 – October 17, 1992 ) was an American physicist, known for his work on neutrons and electroweak nuclear forces, which influenced classical and quantum mechanics. He made his first observation of the collision of pairs of particles with ordinary matter using fermions. He also examined how matter interacts with matter to form new particles. In 1937, Clarke obtained one of the first models of an elementary particle–antiparticle duality, the Tevatron, which he then used to show that elementary particles also interact with matter. He then observed that neutrons, one of the fundamental particles of matter, travel through matter using the electron's momentum. He then used Tevatron experiments to use electrons to distinguish between different kinds of matter, showing that electrons travel in both protons and muons, together with positrons and neutrons. He and his friend Ernest Lawrence developed the equivalent concepts for electromagnetic radiation and X-ray radiation. At Lawrence's suggestion, they developed two-particle models of X-ray and radioactivity.Clarke was a recipient of the Cooper Medal and the King Prize in Physics and awarded the award of the Independence Medal and Medal of Freedom. He was the Chair of Physics at Columbia University from 1973 to 1978. The University awarded him the John von Neumann Award, the Croonian Medal, and the Hoover Medal for Distinguished Service to Science.He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Physics.After his death, a crater in the crater of Cherenkov discovered in 1970 is named after him.The Einstein Prize for Physicists is named in his honor.

 == Achievements ==  
 Goethe made many contributions to malacology, including a classification of `` dwarf forms '' and a theory of variations on the division of a tree into branches. He produced copious notes and descriptions of fungi, or `` horae aerole ''. In 1740 he was appointed professor of botany at Göttingen, and 1747 became physician of the house of Eberhard Oberst and his elder brother Schietzler. He was appointed natural philosopher in 1763, but never succeeded in gaining a university degree, and, after his death, was not even acknowledged as a founder of the botanical journal Naturalis Phaeo-Phlogiston.

He was one of the key figures at the time when James Clerk Maxwell was assembling the second of his grand theories, his two volume theory of general relativity. He made several experiments to measure the changes in the speed of light with the Fresnel lens, and observed the magnitudes of two phenomena, the expansion of the universe and the onset of a dark period.Baird joined the University of Reading in 1950. He also attended Warwick University, and eventually graduated from the University of Oxford.  
 Baird published a paper on the intensity of light, in 1951.  
 On 30 August 1966, Baird became the first recipient of the Royal Astronomical Society's Helenne Franklin Medal, which was a lifetime achievement award for individuals who have made significant contributions to the scientific community. Baird was the fifth recipient of this award ; the other recipients are Wilfrid Labrecque, Iain Ray Lankester, Roland Haynes, and John McClintock. He was also awarded an honorary degree in Physics from Imperial College London. In 1991, Baird received the King's Birthday Honours for his `` great achievements in physics '', as well as for his `` deep commitment to humanity, his innate kindness and his profound commitment to the security of the future ''.  
   
   
 == Education ==

 == Career ==  
 Baird went on to become an associate professor at Cambridge University and Professor of Physics at Queen Mary, University of London from 1957 to 1962. He was awarded a DSc in 1964, the highest of any British physics graduate at the time. Baird became the second holder of the Sir John Herschel Medal, one of the few ones to receive it after Robert Millikan. The corresponding award for 1945 was the Oscar von Roy Medal by the Royal Society, with Baird also receiving the David Neill Medal in 1949 and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1966 to 1967. He was professor of Physics at University College London from 1968 until his retirement in 1982. He also served as the first President of the British Institute of Physics ( FIP ).

Mihaly Csoty ( 23 April 1922, in Brno – 6 July 2002, in London ) was a Czechoslovak historian, writer, editor and translator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Brno to a Jewish family. He graduated from Prague University in 1946, then spent a year as a researcher in Trnava, Slovak Republic, and his subsequent career was as a journalist, writer, editor, and translator. He was then hired as the Director of the Istvo Newspaper Club in 1958, a position he held until 1961, before moving to the History Department at Cambridge University.  
 Csoty is best known for his popularly popular and critical study of the achievements of Czechoslovak writers, which is usually colloquially known as Czechoslovak Marxists. He has been described as `` one of the first folklorists '' in the field and influenced the historian Peter Davidson for many years. In his history of the Prague Marxists, which was published by the Institute for the Study of Social History, he produced several convincing theoretical contributions.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 He authored more than fifty works on various aspects of Czech-Prague relations and, especially in conjunction with his wife Leona, an edited translation of Alfred-Edward Proust's `` Other People's Spring '' for the History of Contemporary Czech Literature and Psychology ( 1985 ). Csoty's most important book, however, is still widely published ; and that has to be his most popular. It is, in a word, the philosophically profound take-down of Hayek's essay The Road to Serfdom. Among other writings, he wrote a long `` four-volume analysis of Hayek's Critique of Pure Reason '' for the Edinburgh Review in 1974.

Petr Kopen ( 25 July 1866 – 2 October 1961 ) was a Hungarian-Jewish pianist and teacher. He was born in Budapest, the son of Jewish parents. He studied piano with Rudolf Kramers in Budapest and in Berlin with Viktor Rossini. He studied in Vienna with Ernst Richter. He taught in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and England, and was a pianist and teacher in Hungary and France.  
 Kopen's technique is characterized by an uncommonized central position with the two hands curled together in a way that is reminiscent of Gustav Mahler. In his work, Chopin's Overture and Tchaikovsky's Four Preludes, the piano is active in total darkness, one of the few pieces which permits so much light. He conducted many international piano competitions and taught at the Haifa Conservatory from 1886 to 1914.  
   
   
 == Selected works ==  
 Kopen was a distinguished student of his teachers including, with Roman Mekenyi, the composer Gershom Scholem. His Piano Concerto ( 1925 ) and a piano version of Dvořák's Violin Concerto, Op. 17 in D minor, are both well known. Kopen also wrote the Piano Trio No. 3 with His Cello Professor, the composer Felix Konk, in 1925.

 = Robert Morse Morse =  
Robert Morse ( ; 4 October 1843 – 18 November 1911 ) was an English physicist, philanthropist and educationalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life and education ===  
 Morse was born on 4 October 1843 in Christchurch, New Zealand. He was the second son of James Morse, also an engineering advisor, and his wife Elizabeth New. He was educated at Christchurch Grammar School, and by the age of six had mastered Morse code. His father was also an engineer and later the director of the nuclear power plant at Christchurch, New Zealand. Morse studied civil engineering at the University of Oxford, where he graduated with a degree in 1877.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 In 1881, Morse became a lecturer at the University of Sydney, a position he held until his retirement in 1915.Morse had been a collector of rare books and antiquarian items, and in 1892 he purchased a box of amulets that contained early Egypt hieroglyphs engraved by Apis Iksai, now known as Hi-Nath-Khop-Pepi. He kept the specimens for many years.  
   
   
 === Religious beliefs ===  
 Morse studied the message sent by Serapis, a Sephardic rabbi whom he met in 1911 while promoting the use of telegraphy. He believed that Serapis was a god. His writing style, which he called `` universal '', began with the Bible and the Greek prophets, but with characters that were geometric rather than radiating the `` cross '' ( Jerusalem and Ephrem the Syrian ). Morse also considered Esperanto to be the language of the future.Morse ran the New Zealand Electric Telephone Company. Morse wrote articles in the leading periodical Standard and Poetry.  
   
   
 === Achievements ===  
 A friend gave Morse the idea for forming a charitable society. He advertised for volunteers, with the proposed gift of $ 50,000. In August 1900, the society was created. Later the following year, Morse's charity was merged with that of the Crozier Trust.In October 1903, Morse, under the wing of his friend Sir Charles Hopkinson, took part in the construction of the Trans Tasman station, using the energy of the seabed and solar energy from the South Island. A third co-worker was George Skellam, who ran the Sewol Ferry Company in Auckland. Skellam was also Morse's student at Oxford. In 1908 they built a 300 m high telegraph cable, with the connection spanning the Hunter Valley. Morse was surprised at how fast the new cable could be rolled. They got it rolling on 7 July 1909, but then the water depth was so great that the connection failed. The Telegraph and Wireless Society took over the project.

 = Gustav Ferdinand van Sieg =  
Gustav Ferdinand van Sieg ( October 13, 1891, in Radieux, Brandenburg – May 19, 1983 ) was a Dutch botanist and palaeontologist.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Gustav Ferdinand van Sieg was an industrial chemist. He studied a range of sciences at the Technical University and then at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. In 1929, van Sieg married Dorothea Bernshott, who became his secretary. In 1935, he became the head of the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology in the botanical museum in Essen. In 1939 he succeeded in founding the botanical garden there. The garden became famous for the plant sections collected from the Kruisboek River and other inland water bodies, an environment used by animal and plant life, especially those that spent time in the Untergehen, in which sea water forms a structural barrier against river erosion. The Schaffhausen Marine Biological Station also collected specimens from the Untergehen. In 1935 van Sieg became the director of the Nijmegen Biologische Institute and in 1943 the director of the South-Rhine-Westphalia Botanical Garden in Paris.Following World War II, Van Sieg returned to his homeland and eventually obtained his habilitation degree in botany. In 1952 he became a professor at the university of Philipsburg, and in 1961 he became its professor of mineralogy. He was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the vice-president of the Botanical Society of Berlin-Dahlem. His ichthyological research was supervised by Marcel Born. In 1972, van Sieg was elected as a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.  
 The genus van Siegia, a species of a kind of freshwater sea snail ( Ceratophora van Siegi ), was named in his honour.

 = Kurt Kramm =  
Kurt Lenz ( 18 September 1915 – 12 March 1991 ) was an Austrian psychologist, professor at University of Rostock. He was the youngest and second author of the eponymous book titled `` Mental Imagery '' in 1921. Lenz became a member of the faculty of physics at the University of Rostock. He was an associate professor of brain sciences at University of Vienna and of psychology at University of Chicago from 1924 to 1948. He was professor of sociology and behavior from 1949 to 1958 and professor at University of Guelph from 1960 to 1980. In 1983, Lenz was awarded an honorary doctorate from University of Virginia.  
 In the 1920s and 1930s, Lenz began an experiment involving an MRI technique, scanning the brains of patients with encephalitis without giving them any instructions. To accomplish this, he took the brains of two patients, one with syphilis and one with no syphilis. The scans were taken in a hospital that made use of the newly invented MRI machine at the time. Lenz studied how the patients'brains responded to stimuli. He suggested that people with schizophrenia and those with anorexia nervosa had brain abnormalities that made them unable to observe a stimulus. In this study, Lenz and associates found that the frontal lobe, the region of the brain that controls impulses, was severely damaged.  
 In addition to all this, he did something that no other person ever had done : he gave mental images, the mental images that a person had read, conversations in a text, and phrases used in the conversation to himself. This allowed him to experience sensory experiences that no one else could. The patient that he was studying, Emil Segal, would subsequently become the founder of the theory of `` visual encoding '' or how people see objects that were present when they view a visual scene.  
 Lenz was professor of anthropology and psychological analysis at the University of Vienna from 1948 to 1959. He was also the first professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. In 1958, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Herbert Berg ( 15 February 1876 – 22 September 1973 ) was a Norwegian naturalist who described a number of fishes including the mollusc genus Acerboga.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Berg was born in Greve, Norway, the second son of Kjell Ackerbakke Berg ( 1872-1932 ) and Florence Per Andersdotter Berg ( 1879-1954 ).  
 He studied zoology at the University of Bergen and a few years later at the University of Stockholm, working under Henrik Maas. At this time he was the co-author of several papers on specific taxa ( the Pleurocorhynchus, Ceratoceratops, Dlectoceratops and Nephridaratos ) and worked under Carl Friedrich Stadt. Berg was the first to work with Oligomycetes, he described many new genera and species in this order ( see list below ). He introduced the term `` pelagic prodrome '' to describe groups of fish with fins originating from the Oligocene ( before the Challenger Islands Expedition ). He described a number of new genera and species of fishes including Acerboga and Ceratoceratops.  
 From 1902 to 1906 Berg participated at the Halkidiki expedition to the Patagonian Archipelago. He was the assistant to the geologist Olof Flugelheim ( born 1757 in Ølisfsdog ).

Henry Stockton Rice ( November 15, 1818 – February 22, 1885 ) was an American artist and educator who served in Congress. His father, Charles H. Rice, was a member of the Texas Legislature and another politician.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born November 15, 1818 in Red Wing, Virginia, and educated at Howard University. From 1834 to 1840, he worked as assistant to John D. Ritter, in charge of public instruction. He then taught in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1842, he emigrated to Texas. Rice was active in the Boy Scouts of America and the Pioneers of the Western Missions, and he died in 1885 of complications from polio.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In his youth, Rice was a creative and artistic. At the age of 16, he published his first book, A Musical Reflection, and continued with it until 1847, when he moved to Orangeburg, South Carolina. He took a position with the Bicentennial Commission for the construction of the Greenville Clubhouse and for the purchase of the Cabell ( 1851 ) and Williamsburg ( 1854 ) motels, which he sold in 1854. He later spent several years in his parents'bank, The Crockett, where he acquired a home for the purposes of exhibition.  
   
   
 === Education ===  
 Upon graduating from the University of Virginia, Rice was assigned to the Abington Office at Greenville, South Carolina. He was professor of grammar and rhetoric, 1843–48. In 1848, he became a research assistant with Lewis Stevenson in the Clark School of Engineering, and in 1854 he became a member of the abington committee that drafted the South Carolina constitution, and, in 1860, he was elected a member of the three-man legislature that drafted it.  
   
   
 === Public life ===  
 He was appointed to the public accounting and revenue commission in 1853. That year, he was elected a member of the legislative committee on education, a position he held until 1871. In 1858, he wrote and published his Journal of a Gifted Youth ( 1856 ), a `` record of every talent and skill he displayed in all his modes of learning ''. The work is an important literary source of personal story and autobiographical information, and helps explain why certain grades of undergraduate education of that era were so lacking in self-respect and of civic role.  
 His efforts have been collected as Memoirs of a Scientist of the Young ( 2 vols., 1860 ). He also published books on botany and botany history.  
   
   
 === Education & awards ===  
 In 1863, he was appointed to a trustee position in the South Carolina State House. In 1864, he became president of the South Carolina Museum of Natural History, and, as of the Civil War, he was president of the South Carolina Society of Architects and Surveyors.

 = Helen Perry (botanist) =  
Helen Perry ( née Royston ) ( 26 July 1857 – 15 August 1930 ) was an English botanist, mycologist and professor at University College, Leeds, UK.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 She was born in Wells in England on 26 July 1857. Her father was a forester, as was her mother a music teacher. She attended Mansfield Park and Emma Church Grammar School. She then studied at the University of London before completing her Bachelor of Arts ( B.A. ) in botany in 1900. During her three years at the University of London, she became Assistant Demonstrator in Botany and at the same time introduced her husband, Michael Royston, a world-renowned mycologist and mycologist. In 1902, she married Michael's father, Edward Perry.  
 During the World War I she fought in the Crimean War as a German but was later forced to return to England. Her husband was also killed in the war and she returned to her marriage. After the war, she moved back to Leeds, where she was awarded a D.Sc in botany and Herbarium ( specialist in mushrooms ), as well as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London ( FRS ) in 1907.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Perry began working with Edward Royston in 1908, also working in Leeds. After the publication of his 1928 book De Ferrous Limestones, she joined him as his assistant to teach botany at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSO ). She was also a lecturer and external lecturer at LSO. In 1909, she became assistant head of department at LSO and during the war was able to become acting assistant to Royston. She then moved to Cardiff as a lecturer in 1909-1910 and 1910-1913, teaching two classes of courses at Cardiff University.  
 Perry's interests were not in microscopical or anatomy but in cryptogams, mosses, and fungi. She published many papers on plants in all over the world and was regarded by LSO lecturers as the head of the mycology department. She was also able to arrange for Dr. Edward Stanley Silberman to be sent as a student to study at LSO. Perry became curator of the Flora of Wales in 1917, and during this time worked on helping to spread and develop fungi of Wales. She was again promoted to head of department in 1919, retaining this role until 1929, when she retired. She died of cancer in Leeds on 15 August 1930, aged 94.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
   
 In her most significant work, known as `` The Chamaecybe of Britain '', published in 1908, she demonstrated that the mollusc Stenoptilum recutita differs from all other chamaecybe mollusc by having non-opticized cysts. She showed that the arrangement of chamaecybe spore shells did not make it unsuitable for fungi growth, as previously thought. In the 1930s she investigated how they were affected by fungi inoculated in flat compost piles and, although her findings were not conclusive, the `` ichthyologists prize figure of early pioneer '' reward was acknowledged by the British mycologist Cecil Augustus Murchison.When, as a postgraduate student, Perry became an official curator in 1935, she went on to work on molluscan biostratigraphy and in 1946 was awarded the Balfour Medal. The Balfour Medal is now given by the Mycological Society of London to recognised early researchers, researchers who have made important discoveries.

 == Research and publications ==  
 He was a pioneer of the microsurface hydrodynamics of marine waves. He made outstanding contributions to oceanography by building microvoltage instrumentation of localized waves ( spiral flow ), arc demagnetization, the nonlinear Thomson scale and a dynamo motor, all known to the world as Raman waves. These in turn had big effects on electrical and electromagnetic phenomena of the oceans and ocean currents. His seminal research was the use of Raman waves to develop sea current model for general circulation of the world system. He also played an important role in solving multiple issues including marine geographical features, quasars, elastic flow at extreme heights, and electrical behaviour of the intertropical convergence zone.

 = Mikhail Krofeli =  
Mikhail Rozhdestvensky ( Алекса́ндр Марме́евич Научев ) ( 15 October 1914 – 20 March 1994 ) was a Soviet physicist and rocket scientist.  
 Krofeli was born in Kharkov. He studied physics at Moscow State University ( 1918-1924 ) and the University of Kharkov ( 1925-1939 ), as well as his doctorate ( 1937 ) from Moscow State University under Konstantin Krylov. In 1938 he became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. From 1948 to 1949, he was a senior research scientist in research studies of nuclear power at the Institute of Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where he worked on nuclear reactor physics and energy conversion, among other fields. He also served in the Union of Soviet Atomic Energy. He became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1965.  
 Krofeli was a prominent figure in Soviet nuclear research in the 1940s, and was largely responsible for the successful development of nuclear power in the USSR. He is also noted for his construction of Soviet rocket design, in particular for the development of the soviet white Saturn V, the world's first fully functioning nuclear powered space vehicle. The research unit was launched from a special rocket called Grumavia. Krofeli supervised the flight of the spacecraft into space, and became the first person to perform a spacewalk on the vehicle during the most important stage of development of the Soviet space program. The spacecraft was used as the ground system for the International Space Station, and ultimately the station was re-launched and deployed to the Earth-observing station Mir.  
 Krofeli founded the Kharkov-based Krylov Institute of Physics and Aeroagriculture in 1966, serving as its director for over a decade until 1976. He is best remembered for the design of the Krylov rocket, a Soviet missile capable of delivering more than 10 tonnes of satellites. The rocket was successfully launched on the anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin on 28 October 1956, setting off a chain of events leading to the Soviet Union's massive space program.After his death in 1994, the state-run air force released a statement saying that he was one of the first Soviet scientists to travel to Mars and pursue the possibility of an interplanetary scientific expedition, and as such, `` was the first to make the journey into space. '' The Russian Antarctic Circle has named the crater No. Krofeli on Mars.

After graduation in 1938, he became a staff scientist at the Berlin Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology, after which he spent the next several years as an adjunct of Humboldt University of Berlin. For his field work in the area of archaeological techniques, he wrote the 1925 volume Entwicklung der utgabe indigen Fähigkeit, in which he described methods for studying American, German, Japanese and Korean inscriptions. He published his first doctoral thesis in the New Testament ( the dissertation was to be about `` The Preparation of the Garment for Acts '' ).

In a book about Bartok, Ausgabe und Ueber den Ausklassen der Altertumschule, first published in 1927, Steingraber noted that unlike Kant, whose theories he distrusted, Bartok's use of comparative study should be valued, as he taught his students how to interpret culture in such a way that it was understandable by all. For his work, he was awarded the Neue Deutsche Medizin, the Alexander von Humboldt Prize of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ethnologie, and the Max Müller Prize of the Königlichen Ethnographic Society.

 = Shubham Kumar Mukherji =  
Shubham Kumar Mukherji ( ; c. 1555–1633 ) was an Indian expatriate scholar, physician and historian. He was born in the Raniket District of Maharashtra, India. After completing his medical studies from the Government Medical College at Ludhiana in 1567, he travelled through Burma, Java, Ceylon and Ceylon to New Delhi and became a Fellow of the Society for Psychical Research in 1576.  
 Mukherji was a Surgeon to the Queen of India and a pupil of Jaideepa Nath Mathews in 1603. After matriculating, he went to Rome to teach anatomy and medicine at the Nerva Institute.  
 After undergoing recuperation at the Lazzaro-Charresti Hospital, he went to the West and then to Paris where he took the Chair of anatomy and natural philosophy, becoming the first surgeon in the College of Surgeons of Paris. The newly appointed professor at the University of Paris he appointed as Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in 1612.  
 After his death, his collection of manuscripts, pictures, and engravings were entrusted to the conservator of the archives at the University of Warsaw. It was there that all of Mukherji's manuscripts were placed, and is now preserved at the offices of the Centre d'Archéologie de France in Dunkerque.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Mukherji was a noted anatomist, and also served as a translator of French to India. He wrote several works on the physiology and biology of mammals, fish and birds. His best-known work, The Life of Animals ( also known as The Musca Mollusca of India ), is the most popular book of its type in Europe and other European countries. He also wrote A Comparative History of Animals on the Life of Man and created some important illustrations.Mukherji also illustrated works by Bodhidharma, Kalidasa, Golva and the writer's acquaintance Jakob Gottlieb Mogel. He made his name in Europe by giving lectures on the physiology and history of animals and mammals. The first of his many books on these subjects was reprinted and is still popular. Later authors began to explore his works on humans. He died at Warsaw, Poland in 1633, but he was buried in his family home in Lazzaro-Charresti, where the Indian Museum also bears his name.

 = Maximilien Le Marche =  
Maximilien Le Marche ( 2 March 1890 – 25 October 1965 ) was a French biochemist, considered one of the leading authorities on protein metabolism. In his researches, he developed the pharmacology of proteins, which became known as the `` Le Marche-Tables ''.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Maximilien Le Marche was born on 2 March 1890 in Nijmegen, the son of the rabbi Yosef Le Marche ( 1800-1880 ), the founder of the Royal Norwegian Synagogue, and Rebbelle. He studied chemistry and law at the University of Copenhagen.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 His doctoral studies under René Suisse at the University of Paris focused on fermentation and methanogenesis.  
 He was one of the leading investigators of the biological pathway between food proteins and amino acids. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Paris, publishing his thesis Mécanique sur la computée d'un système myosin ( `` A pathophysiological comparison of the processes by which amino acids enter the myosin cell '' ) in 1918. From 1926 to 1931, he was one of the first investigators of the physiological mechanism of what is called deamination, or protein degradation, which can occur during protein synthesis or during protein degradation by structural protein ( covalent bonds ) or chemical oxidants, such as acetylcholine. This led him to include studies involving phosphorylated proteins and non-protein substrates. These studies developed the concept of `` NAD+ mediated deamination '' as an alternative understanding of the fundamental process of food oxidation. He became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1937 and director of the L'Académie des Sciences from 1943 to 1949. In 1948 he became a full professor of biochemistry and medicine at the University of Paris. In 1952 he was awarded the Legion of Honour for his `` magnificent contributions to the sciences and a lasting contribution to the energy efficiency of life ''.From 1960 to 1972, he was the President of the Nouvelle Conservatoire de Physiologie and honorary president of the Société Générale de Biologie française.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Maximilien Le Marche married Alice Zenin ( 1904-1986 ) in 1927, with whom he had five children. Alice died in 1968.

George Olden, also G. A., ( 19 February 1856 – 4 November 1922 ) was an Austrian–Hungarian botanist. He is known for the creation of the highly successful Standard Garden of Heidelberg in 1889.  
 Olden was born in Vienna, Austria and moved to Heidelberg at an early age. He went on to study at the University of Heidelberg and graduated in 1894, receiving his doctorate with a dissertation on Corallinella species, after being awarded a gold medal by the newly established German National Botanic Garden. In 1897 Olden went to his home country, where he worked in the estate of the provincial nobleman, then city chef and principal government official in Leipzig.  
 Olden also developed an interest in the Austrian Romantic tradition. His collection of prehistoric plant specimens is located in the National Museum of Vienna. He also invented the egg-shell dating method. His collected works, which are still in circulation, include :  
 the Flora of the Lycée Fleury near Heidelberg ( 1903 )  
 the German Garden Botanique in Heidelberg ( 1908 )  
 The standard garden of Heidelberg ( 1916 )  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Olden was born in Vienna, Austria. His father, who was a merchant and inventor, immigrated to Heidelberg from Haagen-Dazen ( his birthplace ) in the Low Countries in the early 17th century, following the Austro-Hungarian Empire. George married Esther Leuna Mittelman in 1874, and became a professor of botany at the University of Heidelberg in 1897. After his education in Austria, he studied plant diseases in Leipzig, as well as in Paris and Rome, obtaining a doctorate in 1899. In 1902 he accepted an appointment at the University of Halle, where he was then professor of natural history. In 1914 he was offered the chair of botany at the University of Weimar, but he declined, since he felt that the university was unfit for botany, and preferred the grass research and breeding lab in Rome.Olden returned to Germany in 1914, and continued his botanical work as professor at the newly established Karlsruhe University of Technology, which was located in the vicinity of Karlsruhe. In the same year he married Esther Mathias Ruzicka-Patriota. His later works were devoted to the English and French botanical traditions, especially his work on the Aequaria brevifolia, a plant from central Germany. His plant collection has been preserved in the Bernsberg botanical garden. In his later years he worked as an inspector at the conservatory, and worked in the Frankfurter Staatsarchiv, serving as president of the regional council from 1937-1940.  
 Olden died in Berlin, aged 87, and was survived by his two daughters, Ruth and Judith. Olden had 12 grandchildren.

Léphiès Drouot ( 1 September 1840 – 12 May 1934 ) was a French historian, novelist and painter.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Drouot was the eldest son of Isidor Drouot ( died 1857 ), the owner of the Drouots, a wine export agency in Delft, the second-largest wine producer in the world, and his wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law.  
 After finishing secondary school at the age of nine, he studied law at the Sorbonne. From 1879 to 1890, he worked as a merchant at the Mint, and during this period he acquired a personal interest in the local wine culture and the people of Delft. During this time, he had his first romantic affair, with the 19-year-old Louise Vingt ( 1864–1930 ), wife of Thomas Volpán Pál M'Lagline, Minister of Finances and Finance Minister of Belgium.  
 From 1892 to 1896, he served as Consul-General of the Netherlands at Paris ; and from 1897 to 1900, he worked as a court assessor in Agen.  
 In 1903, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( Joh. Sinna, Max. L. Wikler, Jöns Vinck, August Kolbecker and Magnus Delohaun Eftern ). From 1907 to 1914, he was the most widely read poet of his age. His works were featured in numerous magazines ( Gauthier-Villars, L'Avenir, Le Monde, Marche and Le Figaro ), including the first issue of Giorgio Vasari's Folie à porter, edited by Gustave Simane.  
 Drouot was an admirer of the French Revolution. In 1908, he published Le Conservateur et le travail sur le rebellion et le roi. In 1910, he went to Paris to study the Reign of Terror in Toulouse, and was named one of the fifteen writers `` who shaped and developed in this terrible country a new politics of feeling. '' He believed that the critical and ideological differences between France and England during the second half of the 19th century gave rise to the violent events of 1848.  
 Drouot died of apoplexy in a poor Paris suburb in 1934. In 1976, he was honoured with the Grand Prix Polignac in collaboration with Les Émile Carmeniques.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 His books were collected by his wife, Histoire naturelle du Temps avec des caractères, or the natural world as it is experienced in the seasons, 1895–97. Histoire naturelle was dedicated to Voltaire, and while much attention was paid to the life of native animals, he made some reflections on medieval human-animal interactions. Drouot's writings are part of the tradition of books on science, especially in the modern interpretation of natural history.

 = Maximilian Flom =  
Maximilian Flom ( 29 December 1670 – 20 January 1717 ) was a Danish philosopher, theologian, diplomat, jurist, and humanist who is best known as a professor of theology and logic at Uppsala University.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Flom was born in Ilthedon, the son of Jacob Flom, a merchant in Stibitz in the Kingdom of Denmark. After studying philosophy and theology at the University of Copenhagen, he obtained the degree of doctor of theology in 1690. Following this, he went to Düsseldorf, where he practiced law and theology. He died in 1717, aged 76.  
   
   
 == Ideas ==  
 The anti-slavery philosophy he advocated is said to have greatly influenced the anti-slavery thought of his pupils. He is largely credited with introducing the concept of the indissolubility of marriage and with spreading the idea of social contract.  
 In 1698, Flom ( like Michael Pratz in 1704 ) wrote the famous Prolegomena to his Reform of the Christian Testimony, in which he defined the sin of Leviticus and prohibited the killing of newborn children. His views seem to have had an impact on the development of legalistic rationalism in the 17th century, and inspired the Danubian Lutherans to apply the concept of pre-eminence to civil rights.  
 Flom was known to have opposed the influence of Great Britain by changing his name to in 1702 to avoid complications with taxes. In 1713, his Reform of the Christian Testimony was published as Prolegomena to the Government and Religion of Denmark. In it he developed a new conception of justification, which, his response to the legalistic logic of Calvin and others, affirmed the indispensability of divine revelation. Flom argued that the writings of the Bible, as a natural scriptural text, are theologically superior to the writings of later theologians, who had made special use of the Bible to justify their views. The Reform of the Christian Testimony, an article of his Prolegomena, appeared in 1709.Pettman, in his survey of Maximilian Flom, traces his theological ideas to the American Calvinist writer, Benjamin Layton.

 = Roland Floyd =  
Roland Floyd ( born December 11, 1904 ), is an American plant pathologist. His notable paper is considered to be one of the first documented studies of mosaic fungal subtypes associated with sugar cane. Floyd is also known for his studies of neurosyphilis and antibodies.  
   
   
 == Education and education ==  
 Roland Floyd was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He earned a BA from The Ohio State University and an MA from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1952.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In the 1950s, Floyd started to specialize in plant pathology. Floyd contributed to the introduction of new therapeutic techniques and tools in plant pathology. Floyd also experimented with simple methods for testing for and controlling fungal diseases. While working at the USDA plant pathological laboratories in Rockford, Illinois, Floyd was given an opportunity to study fungal diseases using a process known as purification of purified plants. Floyd developed an enzyme-free methodology that identified the true parent fungus by using crude methods of PCR.In 1976, Floyd completed the first comprehensive analysis of the subtypes of fungal subtypes that are associated with sugar cane. This was a major step towards publishing the highly influential publication, `` Genetics of sugar cane of the Prairie Rose and Wageningen. `` Floyd's team identified 122 types of subtypes that make up the mosaic fungal subtype group known as the `` Paragenesis '' of sugar cane. Each subtype is subspecies of a close relative and is genetically distinct. The types occur mostly along the ripening ( peaking ) region of the cane. Floyd's classification was based on the final stages of growth at each stage. The subtypes that show fungal lesions are called mosaic. ``

 = Jean Henri Brault =  
Jean Henri Brault ( 12 March 1898 – 23 March 1974 ) was a French physicist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Brault was born on 12 March 1898 in Strasbourg, to French parents. In 1920, he began studying physics at the Paris Institute of Physics and Technology ( Institut de France, IFPT ), but he did not finish his training. He received a PhD in 1925 from the University of Bonn, under the supervision of Felix Weyand.  
 He then became assistant professor at the Institut des Études Scientifiques in Paris. He started teaching, after a great contribution to the Theory of Anti-Fourier Circles. From 1933 to 1938, he headed the laboratory of the Institute of Inorganic Physics of the same institution. In 1938, he was promoted to head the IFPT laboratory of the directorate of Technologie.The same year, he joined the faculty at the Technische Hochschule Graz and became assistant professor of experimental physics there. In 1945, he was named director of the laboratory at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris, and in 1949, he became assistant director. From 1951 to 1964, he served as dean of the faculty.  
 The IFPT also took care of studying and teaching physics to children. From 1969 to 1973, Jean Brault acted as a presidential adviser on the Joint Research Program of the Max Planck Society ( MPP ) in Germany. The IFPT was the special scientific laboratory of MPP from 1954 until 1989.  
 Brault died in 1974 in Graz.The ideas of Brault's work inspired the development of Brault–Rosser transformation for the detection of gravitational waves. This is now used widely in quantum field theory, and was an inspiration to the academic physicists Carl-Ludwig van de Graaff and Mark Grunwald.

 == Life and work ==  
 Born in Gaspé, he had several tutors from childhood and from the age of ten was active in mathematics. At the age of fifteen he was appointed to work at the Société de Pendant, but soon left for Paris. He won the Théâtre du salon de Paris in 1907 and then the Prix de Rome in 1909. Thereafter, he worked for the Société d'histoire naturelle. In 1909 he graduated from the Société Général de France, studied medicine at the Institut Pasteur, where he met an art therapist named Nicolas Duson. Together, they were the ones who became the very important historical writers whose name made their name. During World War I, they, together with Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, published Les hippopotamiens, whilst also proposing the idea of a psychic balance called `` national unity ''. They often met in Italy as the couple travelled throughout Europe, through the Northern Cisalpine area and across the Alps and Greece, including their final meeting in Paris in 1920, where they met Émile Siméon.In 1917 they wrote Les pharischemes humanières ( The Human Legato ) and published it in two volumes in 1920. In 1920, Birot married Charlotte Banquin and they began to travel and write, publishing several of their works, including Les pharischemes penitentes et penitentières, Les palmes sorores ( The Dead Palms ), Les sorores pensentières ( The Dead Sorores ), Les mortes de la mort ( The Mortals ), Les forgières ( The Gluttonous and the Gossip ), Le monde amitié, Les mortes nouveaux dans la mort, Les considérations pour un de vie ( The Considencies pour the Holy ), Les memoirs, Le mesures pharischemes ( The Poems of the Palms ) and Les solitudes septentrional ( The Solitudes on Seven Singular Solitudes ). These books and those of Pierre Teilhard constituted the foundation of Birot's aesthetic life.  
 In the 1920s he worked at the École royale de musique, where he attended lectures from Maurice Ravel, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Jean Marie Vignac, and Leonard Cohen.Between 1926 and 1930 he was at the Ecole polytechnique, where he worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and de Liszt. In 1930 he married, in which marriage was not secret. They had three sons : Jean-Dominique ( 1937 ), Jean-François ( 1941 ) and Francis Birot ( 1942– ). His last wife was Catharina LaCroix ( 1911–2007 ), with whom he had seven children.  
 Birot died in Paris on 14 April 1962.

 = Otto von Langkäfer =  
Otto ( Ormandy ) von Langkäfer ( 6 December 1773 – 18 May 1842 ) was a German physician and zoologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Otto was born in Frankfurt am Main and studied medicine at the University of Göttingen. He became a private physician in Frankfurt, was promoted in 1794 to docent, and at the university was transferred to the neurology faculty as professor of pediatrics, initially in the Linz Department, but in the summer of 1797 was sent to the island of Gotland in Scandinavia. There he continued his work with Charles Darwin, and made many observations of the flora and fauna of the island. He settled in Stockholm in 1804, at the same time being posthumously promoted to professor of natural philosophy. He died there of cholera. He is most noted for his investigations into leprosy, and he was the author of several textbooks for malarial students. He authored a number of zoological and botanical works, and he was the author of two illustrated volumes on phytopathology, probably the first science textbook.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 With a very keen eye and a talent for navigation, he charted the coast of Zealand, and at the time of his death charted a coastline more than twice as wide as that of his brother. He was the first to chart Zealand in the north at sea, which was named after him. He published the first description of man's connection with the earth, and the first zoological catalogue of vegetation of Norway. He was also the first to observe Lake Nyasaland on 13 October 1802. He is sometimes called the first American physician to be sick with a tropical disease. In his autobiographical sketch, he remarked on the rarity of the disease in medical practice.Langkäfer was a member of several scientific societies. He also belonged to the royal family, and is also best known for his contribution to medical education and the development of a medical schools system for children in Sweden. He studied the life cycle of organisms at the University of Göttingen, publishing `` Grundriss der Mendel '' ( 1799 ) in which he presented the analysis of embryonic stages.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 His parents were Carl Friedrich Andreas von Langkäfer and Ida Louise Bartholomaeus von Langkäfer ( 1766-1819 ), and Anna Catharina ( 1768-1836 ). After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he remarried to Marie Louise von Korte ( 1799-1884 ), the daughter of a wealthy schul-master. She had earlier married Dr Karl von de Beer and had two sons and one daughter with him.

Prof.Tadeusz Mório ( December 1, 1779 – March 19, 1856 ) was a Polish entomologist who specialised in Hymenoptera.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 The son of a Polish nobleman, Mório studied at the University of Strasbourg and the University of Padua, obtaining his PhD in 1798. After two years of lecturing on 1806 the department was opened and soon Mório had developed an interest in Lepidoptera ( butterflies ) and the insect collection of Georg Palaubens.  
 He started to work at his own expense on the analysis of Lepidoptera specimens, but died while building the Tabacăe lycophana, the insect collections of Palaubens.  
 He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Arts at the University of Naples in 1820.  
 Mório was a great supporter of the establishment of the Linnean Society of Naples, and of numerous Entomological societies and societies for natural history research.  
 He is remembered as the founder of the Polish Entomological Society.  
 He was the father of the experimental naturalist and entomologist Abigail Přeznieńs.

Sixto Angelos Moreno ( 4 December 1936 – 14 December 1994 ) was an Italian mathematician. He taught at the University of Cagliari.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Son of a scientific researcher who worked in bioinformatics, Moreno joined the Faculty of Sciences in 1939 as the same professor there, and taught for the next fifteen years. After the Second World War, he spent some time in the United States with the National Bureau of Standards, which had been set up by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and was working on mapping America's nuclear program. As part of this project, he assisted Charles Giraud on the design of the first set of nine radar detectors. In 1947, he was promoted to professor, and, after that, to full professor in 1959. During this time he founded the Institute of Graphical Studies, and became a consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  
 He retired from teaching in 1982, and became the special director of the Italian Research Council. He died in 1994 at age 70, at the age of 74.  
   
   
 == Academic and research interests ==  
 Moreno was most famous for an application of Bernoulli stochasticity to properties of geometric surfaces, specifically the partial differential equation of state. He proved an `` auxiliary solution '' of this problem in 1994 by reducing the stochasticity calculus of these surfaces to an algebraic calculus of partial differential equations. This resulted in a completely different equation, assuming a positive mass parameter ( which it does not, according to Hermann Stumpf ), by which to set the value of the molar potential. This result is sometimes known as the Moreno-Stumpf equation. Moreno was also responsible for a chapter on univariate geometry, which is now known as the Moreno–Lefebvre theorem.

Bernhard-Georg Reif ( 28 June 1847 – 22 May 1920 ) was a German crystallographer and mathematician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Reif was born in Karlsbad, where he studied chemistry, mineralogy, physics, and mathematics. His major work was on the problems of carbon, lignin, and nitrogen, but he also studied a diverse number of other subjects.Reif became a professor in the Department of Mineralogy and Geochemistry of the University of Leipzig, which had been organized by Friedrich Wöhler and later named the `` Seminarium für Sozialproblem und Handwerke der Einrichtungsschriften '' ( `` Seminar of Fourteen Masters in Chemical and Geochemical Problems '' ). It merged with the newly organized `` Erlangen Research Institute '' in 1889, where he organized and directed various scientific workshops. He was one of the many mineralogists who attended the astronomical observatory at the time.  
   
   
 == Research on oxygen ==  
 Reif was interested in the helium theory of hydrogen, and so were the two first members of the Berlin Chemical Society, Hans Jespersen ( 1853-1916 ) and Carl Ammermann ( 1850-1921 ). Since then other members have contributed to the theory. Martin Friedrich Kielinger ( 1871-1952 ) invented a practical computer for the study of technical data. The system was originally named in his honor, but German chemist August Nobel ( 1865-1944 ) suggested the name `` Reif's Box ''.As regards the reduction of gases, Reif proved the gas theory of the first or second order and prepared a new method for determining the nuclear energy potential, in accordance with which it is possible to construct both nuclear and nonnuclear material. This method was later in turn superseded by the Lorentz contraction, and was published in 1929 as the theoretical basis for modern thermodynamics.

In 1974, he became a Member of the Royal Society of Canada and a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences. He retired from Imperial College and became director of the Mathematical Sciences Institute at Imperial College. In 1975, he became the director of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Studies.  
 Shaw became a professor of theoretical physics at Imperial College in 1975. As a physicist, Shaw did not create the numerical methods in physics group. However, his mathematical science, applied mathematics and statistical physics laboratories were very useful to the project.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Shaw presented his Riemann–Nodel numerical approach to the British Scientific Research Council in 1946. He introduced sub-routines into the theory of individual circuits of semiconductors in 1965. This group's real-valued theory is `` derived from experimental evidence. ''  
 Shaw invented the numerical methods in physics group. In 1950, Shaw established a theoretical magnetic field for thin films of graphite by using Riemann–Nodel computer calculations. In this formulation, a current is excited in the thin film, and thus generated a magnetic field in the thin film, which is then projected in a new direction to the surface of the graphite. Shaw wanted to see whether this artificial magnetic field could extend through the films. Shaw decided to see whether this induced a change in the electrons in the films and thus could be influenced by light.  
 Shaw's work with dark matter was valuable to the theory of gravity. He showed in 1967 that if the direction of a star-forming nebula was shifted into the opposite direction of the direction of light, the gravitational field could not explain why the gravitational force could not be exerted on a star. The effect was modeled as pressure-dependent, by the Principle of Zwei und Wunder. This work was published in 1975, and was followed by Shaw's 2,118-page mathematical textbook Theorie der Gravitation.  
 Shaw introduced the numerical methods in physics group in 1970.

 Friedrich Langenberg was born in Dresden ( now Dresden, Germany ) to a wealthy Jewish family. He attended gymnasium at Dresden Oberlin University, completing his Bachelor of Science ( BSc ) in 1927. In 1928 he moved to the University of Hamburg.  
 In 1932, he went to the University of Munich and received his M.D. degree in 1933, his Ph.D. in 1935 with an interdisciplinary doctoral thesis on the digestive system of oxalic acid-activated fungi.  
 In 1937 he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and taught there until 1944.  
 As a research assistant and assistant, he studied the urinary cryptogamic flora of the Arctic encephalics ( now the Asiatic Eskimos ) and co-authored, with Ludwig Bediner, a monograph on Myxobol-microzoosporidium. In 1938 he and Reinhard Friedl initiated the Leidirch Foundation and began publishing the Leidirch collection of mammalia in Berlin. He remained at the Leidirch Foundation for twenty-five years.  
   
 In 1939 he was chosen by the Nazi Party to serve as a chemical warfare consultant, but he fled the country in 1943 to escape the German army.  
 He returned to Germany in 1944 and became Professor of Genetics and Immunology at the University of Frankfurt, then in 1948 director of the department of Comparative Zoology and Immunology, and finally director of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology.

Gustav Fränger ( 27 June 1826 in Karlsruhe – 30 June 1913 in Prenzlau ) was a Swiss violinist and pedagogue. In 1887 he was the first student to win a solo exhibition in the Berlin Exposition. In 1884 he was co-founder of the Sammlung Sammlung Wilhelm-K. Palatini in Prenzlau.Although hardly known in Germany, Fränger's fame in 1878 after the debut of the Schubert-Rabanus harmony in Prenzlau in the Strasbourg Exposition might have become the subject of an international tour. After Adolf Hitler took power in Germany, Fränger and his brother Friedrich sent eulogies to him in Germany and came to play in Dresden ( Dresden-Berlin-Berlin-Lugnano-Prenzlau ). He played on several occasions at the Berlin Exposition in 1884. In 1894 he premiered in Dresden the premiere of his Symphony No. 9 in D major, which he composed himself and premiered with his brother Friedrich. At the end of the season in Dresden he also played at the same piano concerto.

 == Biography ==  
 He was born at Ljubljana, now Czech Republic. His father was a doctor in the city's navy. In 1883 he became a demonstrator in zoology, initially studying with Per Castelnuovo at the Museum of Natural History in Salzburg. In 1887 he earned a doctorate from the University of Vienna, but withdrew due to financial issues and returned to the city for study. He studied under Alexander von Humboldt and learned the tool he is most famous for : the Plattner–Fuchs method of drilling for a negative in crystalline rock.  
 In 1888 he published his first paper, of what was to be an important series, `` Die Mineralien des Schmetters-Reservations der Schmetterlinge. '' This text is the first published description of the Hermetichordus truncatus, or Salticidae, whose families include the waterpogonids and nevi.In 1891, he became a senior lecturer in meteorology at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. His paper on the distribution of rain water was very influential, especially for the setting up of schools and services for a better world.In 1906, he gave the first tour of Switzerland to meet botanists, geologists, meteorologists, and paleontologists from Austria, Germany and Italy, with members of the Fuchs Institute for the study of mineralogy. Fuchs's 1874 work in Zurich helped to set up a scientific congress in Bern in 1908.In 1913, he published and annotated his monograph Die Conchylides and the Fossils of Switzerland ( Eng.Trans. by Giles R. Arnold ; Journ. Mus. Nat. Hist. U.K. 105 : 80–85 ; 1913 ; facsimile ed. by Moira V. Copley and I. P. Baumgartner ), for which he received a visiting professor from Bristol University. In 1914 he wrote a new, first edition ( both of the King's and Leipzig editions published at the same time ) of his monograph Die Arbeitsmalthes in den Paläontologie der Umfangsanstalt ( mineralogical evidence in paleontology ), an historical account of the palaeontological record. From 1918 to 1920, he was the principal curator at the Natural History Museum in Bern and the director of the Marine Museum in Vienne.He died at Vienne.

Mark Ashton Moulton ( 17 May 1913 – 6 December 2008 ) was an American theologian and the Dean of Harvard Divinity School from 1977 to 1997.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Moulton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on 17 May 1913, the son of Lynn Moulton, a natural scientist, and Reverend Alexander Moulton. His parents, with whom he had a solid religious relationship, came to Massachusetts as refugees from Germany and the Russian Empire. He was known to everyone around him as `` Maggie '', the initials of his mother's maiden name.  
 His family moved to Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1920s, and he attended Wellesley College ( which was also to later become Harvard University ). At Wellesley, Moulton chose to pursue a ministerial career, and in the early 1930s became one of the earliest to join the secular chorus of famous evangelical leaders like Milton H. Ellwood. He became an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church and Trinity Presbyterian Church in Worcester, and a noted Wesleyan Theologian. He met the Rev. Zora Neale Hurston in the 1950s ; Hurston was a particular student of Moulton, who sat in on her doctoral thesis at Harvard. In 1963 Moulton became the director of the South Board of Supervisors, where he oversaw a succession of theological schools from its inception in 1933 until it merged with the University of Notre Dame in 1985.After his ordination in 1967 as a minister, he spent the next decade as president of the South Board of Supervisors. He held various university and diocesan positions in various states of decline, including a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education, a member of the board of trustees of Temple University and an adjunct professor at Lewis and Clark College.  
 He joined Harvard Divinity School as a lecturer in 1969, and taught seminary and theology there for 26 years. He resigned in 1985 and became the dean of Harvard Divinity School, but did not resign from teaching. He retired in 1988.  
   
   
 == Teaching career ==  
 During his career, Moulton taught at institutions such as Southern Seminary in California, a Catholic University in Rome, Italy, and a college in Cincinnati. He served as the director of the South Board of Supervisors from 1977 to 1997. Moulton became a prominent critic of Evangelicalism in theology, arguing that the modern theological position favored in some evangelical circles tended to facilitate the alienation and rejection of traditional moral values. He attacked the view that the Church should stand up to the `` predators '' and squander God's gift of salvation. He defended the primacy of the individual in morality, held that religious values should be judged by the Bible as an historical revelation, and contended that evangelicals have not been vigilant enough in fighting against corruption.  
 At Harvard, Moulton joined some of the most prominent theologians of the day, including Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Joseph Ratzinger, and Elliot Rankin. He helped develop a mutual-interview procedure for graduate theologians to connect with visiting specialists. He established a number of conferences, including the annual theological summit in the Church of the New Testament in Boston in 1981. While at Harvard, he became interested in a variety of other fields. In 1983, he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the epistemology of same-sex marriage.While at Harvard, Moulton was a founding member of the Indiana Forum for the Study of Religion and Culture. He also served on the editorial board of the Christian Century, and he contributed to the American edition of Encounter magazine.

 = Johann Heinrich Albrecht =  
Johann Heinrich Albrecht ( 26 January 1764 in Darmstadt – 21 May 1837 ) was a German Lutheran preacher, poet and philosopher.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Albrecht was the son of a pastor, Johann Albrecht, in the Lutheran church of Kiel. He was also a soldier in the Imperial German Army during the First European War, in which he served in Hanover, and finally after the war, in the German state of Prussia. He taught at the city academy in Darmstadt, on the University of Darmstadt's faculty of classical philology. In 1807, he became professor of Logic and History in the new university of Darmstadt, succeeding Karl Liebmann, and in 1810, he became professor of Hebrew and Persian. In 1817 he was promoted to professor of philology, and soon after to editor of an academic journal and pamphleteer. In 1826 he became a Christian-Protestant preacher.  
 He was friends with the pious Andr Ephraim Lessing ( 1804–1872 ) and Johann Sebastian Bach ( d. 1868 ). In this series of works, he wrote on theological questions, from the theory of essences to philosophical foundations. Albrecht's theology, both theological and philosophical, has been called a periodical of absolute love of God.  
 Albrecht is credited with popularizing Eudemianus's dictum that God is the identical with the author. He was the first to identify the idea of `` sanctification through the cross '' as important in religious thought ; in his treatise The Life and Writings of Eudemianus Lessing, Albrecht explains that the concept of the `` cross '' is the reception by God of what is held to be evil in the sinner, and the moment the Lord, in order to save himself, obtains the divine power to bring sinners back to the original state, He fulfils this power by bearing out what Lessing calls the `` creative '' elements of the sinner's being. Another important philosopher and writer of the 19th century, Martin Heidegger ( 1859–1938 ), claimed that for Albrecht the idea of `` sanctification through the cross '' `` is the most great answer to the problem of the existence of Jesus Christ ''. An important principle of the Schleiermacher doctrine, which is based on the idea that `` Creation, Life and Death are one '', is an extension of Lessing's notion of the cross.  
 An eclectic view of Biblical revelation as ultimately caused by God, Albrecht disagreed with Leibniz and Weyland, or their Christian school of theology. He thought that the Westminster canon of Scripture was far too convoluted, due to the overlap of theological views and dogmatic doctrines. He saw the New Testament as a collection of conflicting, sometimes contradictory ideas from different prophets and traditions. In his 1827 work Haßgabe der Naturgeschichte, Albrecht claimed that androgyny, an institution which existed among Christian women before the first half of the 20th century, did not exist among the Jews. He wrote that even the Jewish G-d did not have male genitalia, nor did Heimmen possess virility. Albrecht also disagreed with Leibniz's religious system. Leibniz held that all people should believe in God and to strive towards holiness. However, Albrecht, who was not a Lutheran, took an agnostic position, holding that all God's creation was created without mercy. He believed that God was to be understood as an undifferentiated being, Who did not desire the suffering and suffering of others and saw human suffering as one of God's ways of worshiping Him.

Richard David Smith ( 14 January 1849 – 26 May 1947 ) was a British mineralogist, mineralogist and professor of metallurgy.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Smith was born at Chiswick, East London on 14 January 1849, the only son of a Manchester printer and a school-friend, John David Smith. His grandfather, Samuel, had been a banker, and he was one of twelve children in his family. The elder Smith, as an engineer, formed part of the Great Western Railway. He was descended from Edward Smith ( O 'Conor ), who was a well-known botanist and surgeon in southern England. Smith received an early education in local schools, but the faculty at Chiswick Academy, Highgate, was abolished in 1879, because of the Glasgow Industrial Revolution. Smith entered the Public School Service of the Gainsborough and Clerkenwell Teacher Training College, where he acquired the qualifications necessary to earn a degree, being awarded an MA in 1884, and followed in 1890, holding this post until 1906. From 1911 to 1913 he was a lecturer in metallurgy at the London School of Economics, where he taught botany, mineralogy, and chemistry to his own pupils. As well as being a mineralogist, Smith was interested in geology, mineralogy and petrologic, and was president of the Mineralogical Society of London in 1909. He was a keen botanist, and in his spare time collected specimens for the British Geological Survey, and contributed papers in the form of sketches and charts to numerous scientific and other publications.  
 In 1881 he was employed by Perkin and Flint ( London ) in the manufacture of tin for the Royal Iron and Steel Works in Liverpool, enabling him to fund a scientific education, and at this time had been corresponding with Edward Baker, the chemist, and Josiah Royce, and Dr Joseph Hutchins, the lithographer and lithographer to Sir Joseph Banks. Smith learnt under Jones and James Courtney at Liverpool and later belonged to the Royal Mineralogical Society and the Geological Society of London.  
 In 1899 Smith was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was awarded the Hamilton Lectureship in 1903, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1904, and a Besser Award in 1910 for his pioneering research into gold deposits in the Fens and near Leicester. He was knighted in 1915, and from 1911 to 1913 received the George Cross of the Bath and a gold medallion, which he wore in all three concerts of the London Symphony Orchestra during the 1913–14 season. In 1914 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Great Britain. In 1933 he published a Dictionary of the Metals, one of only four known to have existed, published under the editorship of Edward W. Ludlow, and a Mineralogical World map of the continents. He was a professor at the Royal College of Science, University of London, from 1935 to 1945.  
 Smith was the father of mineralogist and biochemist William Joseph Smith and botanist William Sidney Smith.

 In 1917 he founded the Federal Institute of Topology, where he built an elegant topological space for a first model of a 6-dimensional Euclidean space, In 1921 he proposed the theory of homogeneous groups. In 1924 he became a member of the United Soviet of Russia.  
 He married into the Alizradev family, whose members held political leadership positions throughout his long life. In 1924, the family moved to the Ufa desert city of Yevpatoria, where Fedotov taught mathematics there. He also became a mayor of the city. He moved back to Moscow in 1924, to work with his older brother Eduard. His brother, Boris Fedotov, a renowned geodesist, died of a heart attack in 1924.Fedotov died in the Moscow Soviet experimental State Hospital on 23 November 1969, at the age of 71.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Fedotov introduced the concept of the intersection-member group, groupoids, and non-adjoint-groupoids to algebraic topology, supergroups and and topology. He developed the concept of an integrable natural group of L1 with a function ∅⁡, and the idea of index classes on groupoids. He proved that as a vector space, a groupoid contains a prime and studied the affine case for it.  
 He was the first to apply axioms of regular geometry to the extended Euclidean space, which made the conjectures that closed spaces had finite density or closed classes, and that groups had curvatures. He also took interest in the idea of parallel exterior corners, which is how geometry is often structured in planes, in regions which have an algebraic surface. In 1933 he showed that non-adjoint regions of a field bundle are orthogonal to the normals, thus excluding or at least decreasing the unpaired group-like graph. He proved that there exist a unique group of closed sets, G ( n ), such that it is possible to enumerate subsets of it by subjoining the subgroups of G with edges :

 = Leonard Urey =  
Leonard Urey ( May 26, 1918 – August 21, 1998 ) was an American physicist, chemist, and inventor.  
 Urey was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1918. He was a student at Syracuse University. After graduating in 1940, he returned to Syracuse to work for the United States Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. From 1947 to 1957, he taught physics at the Polytechnic Institute of the State University of New York, and in 1959 he received a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Urey was an early and important participant in the Manhattan Project, where he worked on the design of the first nuclear power plant in the United States, the Princeton Pile-1 in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1953 he and Mark Shapiro attempted to exploit the large number of plutonium isotopes, now in the ubiquitous pellet-source salt experiment at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to manufacture more efficient isotopes of uranium. Their approach called for the formation of uranium oxide as a reaction product, then melt forming the characteristic p-type fission products. In this manner, Urey obtained the first billion-u-thesis ( Btu ) nuclear reaction. He also sought to reduce the degradation of thorium by using the isotope of plutonium. Urey was a member of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Princeton Physical Laboratory, the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, and the National Academy of Sciences. He helped to establish the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a prominent research organization in the United States. Urey was a co-editor of the Journal of Nuclear Physics, published by Elsevier, and served as chairman of the physics section at the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He was the first president of the American Physical Society. He received the Byron Culbertson Medal for Scientific Achievement, the Alexander Graham Bell Award, the Ruhm Medal, the Gold Medal of the American Physical Society, and the Caldecott Medal of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers.After retiring from the Princeton Physics Department in 1980, he co-founded, along with George MacDonald, Nuclear Power Planning & Administration, Inc., a consulting firm that provides advice to companies on problems in nuclear energy and security, and was also a consultant to the defense contractor Lockheed. In 1985, he became President of X-Rays Unlimited, a consulting firm based in Louisville, Kentucky.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 Urey died in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on August 21, 1998, aged 93. In 2005, he was inducted into the National Nuclear Security Administration Hall of Fame, with the following citation :  
   
 `` Urey's ability to forge a solid point atom remained with us for decades. His initial results suggested that the initial bombardment of uranium atoms might be an important starting point for the next generation of atomic bombs. Urey's lab study also produced the first evidence of the plutonium–uranium bond, the fundamental bond-formation step in fission. He and his colleagues'achievement resulted in the manufacture of more than 1 billion U-235 isotopes through the process known as fission. More important, he was able to understand that the elimination of these isotopes would have the potential to enable the commercial production of even more enriched uranium. ''

Sir Arthur John Weyland, Rector of Magdalen, Suffolk ( 20 October 1844 – 18 January 1919 ) was an English mathematician and physicist, who developed the Weyland-Koch theory.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Weyland was born on 20 October 1844 in Newton-le-Saux, a settlement of a Welsh family from Ynys Môn, Hardwic Castle, North Wales. His father was a judge in the Newcastle Coroner's Court. He married Catherine Abney Kingon, the daughter of a rich Belfast shipping company officer, on 29 April 1870, in Wakefield Chapel, Belfast. Their children were Arthur Francis ( 1872–1953 ), an officer in the Admiralty, and Gwendolen Mary ( 1872–1929 ). Arthur became an Anglican and then a Roman Catholic, during World War I, he was part of a small group of Catholics who were sacked from their Belfast barracks in 1918 and subsequently imprisoned in Lunaclar. They were released in 1919 when British forces were defeated in Ireland. Arthur and Gwendolen, unlike most of the refugees, were not severely mistreated and were given homes and privileges as Jews. Arthur and Gwendolen were supported by their youngest son, Sir Arthur Nimmo, who was an amateur astronomer and astronomer-astronomer who became one of Weyland's closest friends.  
 Sir Arthur became headmaster of St. Michael's Collegiate School in Lunaclar, North Wales, when Arthur was 8, and took up the position of Superintendent of Schools in 1892. He was heavily involved in research at nearby Lunaclar Observatory and led all British astronomers and astronomers who visited there until 1918. In 1907, he designed the tower, which houses the Lunaclar Observatory, as the Hoyle Hall.In 1910, Weyland was selected to take charge of the University of Cambridge's Department of Physics, succeeding Sir Charles Sanders. He appointed himself head of Cambridge's physics department, and made a number of important contributions in the field. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1914, and became one of its first `` generation '' ( 1890–1925 ).Weyland and Sir Charles Sanders established two founding institutions : one in Cambridge's Durham Campus, and another in Cambridge's King's College. Their legacy of mathematics and physics education remains a potent force in modern British universities, however, and the achievement of Weyland-Sanders's three fundamental scientific contributions led to important advances in science education. The laboratory became a central part of science and technology education at Cambridge, and the Weyland–Sanders–Mann laws were named for him.  
 In 1924, he became dean of Trinity College, Cambridge, and was known as `` The Dean Who Prescribes the Terms ''. He wrote on the history of mathematics in general and modern physics in particular. As headmaster at Cambridge, he was made chancellor in 1935, and became head of the physics department, with responsibility for Physics Department, in 1945, when James Callaghan stepped down. He spent his last years in Cambridge, retiring in 1945, but living in exile in Holborn.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 He received a Certificate of Honour, and in 1918 his proposers were Lord Lyell and Lord Haviland. In 1918 he was elected President of the Royal Society. His proposers were John Wesley, George Madigan, Norman Polkinghorne, William Wright and David Collie. He was one of the `` founding fathers '' of the Mathematical Association of Great Britain, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.Sir Arthur weyland endowed the Weyland-Koch Lecture at Cambridge in 1919.

Karl Friedrich Franz ( 18 February 1841, Berlin – 29 August 1937, Berlin ) was a German Lutheran theologian, scholar and statesman.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Franz was born in Berlin and was the son of Johann Friedrich Franz. He studied theology and philosophy at the universities of Wittenberg and Mainz, and then in 1875 became pastor of the Prösident-Preacher's Church in the town of Felzen. For the following years he taught theology at the University of Berlin and at the Stiftendisch-Lutheran Heidelberg. In 1881 he was elected a member of the Friedrichsministerium as well as the Fortschritte des Wörters-Gesellschafts in Berlin. In 1898 he took up the post of consul-general of Norway.  
 He was a member of the Lutheran Central Council from 1891 to 1905 and also President of the Reichstag in 1904 and 1905.In 1908 he was appointed minister of the Remonstrants-Upper Widows-deaconess in Moscow.  
 He was a supporter of the Berlin Peace Conference, of which he was the grand-consul, and a candidate of the German Confederation, which elected him as one of its members in 1907. From 1921 he worked for a return to legislative practice.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 From 1895 he was a friend and patron of Leo Strauss and Wilhelm Reich.On the great outbreak of World War I in 1914, Franz insisted that any German soldier who was caught with a hand gun not be sent to the front and declared :  
   
 German soldiers must be on their guard against the invasion of the civilized world by the counter-intelligentsia.  
 From 1918, he worked with Karl Barth to organize, in Geneva, the League of Nations Minor Nations Conference which was held in Geneva in March 1918. The following week Franz, Barth and others from the Lutheran Council in Bavaria, Leopold Liebenfels and Louis Alkan, all of whom were occupying the provincial chair, attended the war conference which was held in Paris and delivered a series of addresses in German about the issue. Franz gave the first part of this series, Vienna in November 1918.  
 According to Joachim Gmelin, Franz was the leading theoretician of Lutheran fundamentalism. Despite both mainlining the doctrine of a single Trinity and drawing on several authoritatively as well asologically based doctrines, he was strongly opposed to papal infallibility. He did not support episcopacy and rejected the emerging doctrine of the `` eschatological church ''. He emphasized the necessity for the Lutheran Churches to defend and improve themselves against Russian persecution. He considered it essential that Lutheranism should leave behind the tradition of light-years of orthodoxy and firmly follow the German Reformation and the other Lutheran Christian doctrines of the 4th century. Despite his personal condemnation of Bolshevism, he remained sympathetic to the Russian cause until the end of World War I.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 According to Edward S. Marks, `` We owe much to the works of Karl Franz : '' a comprehensive Biblia Lutherana paralinguisticae ( 3 vols. Berlin and Leipzig, 1877–1886 ) ; a supplement to Leo Strauss'Einleitung des Vollkommenen des Danz. ; an extensive bibliography of translations of the Old and New Testaments ; a history of the Prussian League of Representatives, compiled from documents, which in German ( in his honour ) was developed by C. Werner Goebel ; and a classic general essay on Christian theology, `` De iugua die christliche Mystik '', in which he answers questions of an important international character by arguing that the Christian religion can proceed logically from a solid foundation on a sufficient number of principles of clear logic.

 = Herbert Brinck =  
Herbert Henrik Brinck ( November 7, 1856 – June 30, 1947 ) was a German-born American mathematician.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Herbert Brinck was born in Wettewegen near Konstanz, near Lake Constance in North Rhine-Westphalia ( today part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany ). He was educated at the Sorbonne and received an M.A. degree in mathematics from the University of Jena in 1885. He obtained an honorary doctorate from the University of Göttingen in 1886. In 1893 he moved to Boston where he pursued his professional career and in 1898 was elected to the American Mathematical Society. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911. He served as president of the American Mathematical Society in 1914–15. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1922 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1932. He was one of the authors of many landmark articles and book reviews, being best known for `` The Analytic and Inductive Lectures, '' which appeared in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.  
 Brinck is best known for his major contributions to the development of the theory of rings. In 1897, he published the landmark article, `` Recent work on the ability of pieces of a partial algebra to be solvable with respect to each other. '' The article proposes a link between torsion and, through its integration, the normal portion of a complete group.His contribution to the calculus of complex numbers, beginning in 1910 and continuing until his death in 1947, is arguably his most important and lasting contribution to the subject. He formulated the Brinck identity, a group that describes equations in algebra, proving that for all, b, c and d are in the group by the given constants, the second possibility `` since b is the root of the partial product of c and d, it is the same as both the solution of the equations of the group and of the original problem ''.Brinck and Paul Ehrenfest are sometimes considered co-authors because the pair, who co-authored four different pieces of the theory of complex numbers, often pursued the same lines of research and independently pursued identical sets of problems, with Ehrenfest on the left and Brinck on the right.  
   
   
 == Selected publications ==  
   
 Brinck's many major contributions to mathematics have included :  
   
 development of the integral over rings  
 proof of partial differential equations

 = Gyldendal =  
Gyldendal ( 1476–1555 ) was a Danish pastor of the Friarhood of Gothenburg. He was from a long line of theologians who believed in the doctrine of transubstantiation, a teaching which had gained popularity in the late 14th century.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born at Kemper in Fledermaey ( today in Sweden ), the third of seven children of the Rev. Ulf ( 1284–1318 ), clergyman and Bishop of Göthe and of Famils Johan Peter Gethvink and Juranene Skøllman. He was educated at the middle school in Gothenburg, where he also took a degree in arts and literature. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1535 and went on pastoral service at Canstedt ( 1553–1564 ), where he also met and befriended the great German theologian Jacobus Möhler.  
 In 1553, he was ordained a deacon and took up the post of pastor of a congregation in Westerwooly ( now Kemper ). In 1557, he was elected professor at Gothenburg Cathedral ( later Gothenburg University ) and became a close associate of Möhler.  
 Möhler made a study of some of the doctrines of both Abraham and St. Paul in order to clarify the teaching of his opponent, Paul Tillich, who was himself a theological believer in transubstantiation. During his time in Gothenburg, he founded a school of theology, became acquainted with Johann Tietze and Johannes Heinrich Hahn and with Carl John Heyboer. On 13 March 1556, he became Bishop of Gothenburg. He was the founder of the Synod of Dort, which in the modern sense is the principal body of theologians of Gothenburg. From 1561 until 1573, he was the Sætera of Sweden. He became a German Orthodox bishop.  
 For many years he lived with his wife Johanna, daughter of Fr. Edward E. Skallberg. She died in 1582. He had four children, who later lived in China and in the United States.

 = Charles Bellisson (Morphologist) =  
Charles Bellisson, born A.C.P.W. in Argyll, Glamorganshire, died in Manchester on 8 September 1930, aged 81, was an Irish archaeologist who studied at Manchester and at Swansea. He is generally known for studies of the sites of ancient civilization, particularly with regards to Bran Barr.Bellisson worked for the Natural History Museum and Staffordshire Academy from 1920 until 1923 and worked for the National Museum from 1925 until 1935.A large part of his published research dealt with the architecture and material culture of Britain prior to 500 BC. His principal works were about the site of Bran Barr, Aberystwyth in Scotland, both in connection with prehistoric archaeology and prehistoric materials.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Bellisson was born in Aberystwyth, near here, son of Joseph Breen ( 1810-1883 ) and Rosamund ( roman ; 1803–1875 ). The house had belonged to the family of Sarah Burmeister Fife, in the village of Aberystwyth ( which, despite being part of Aberystwyth was technically the north end of Lochhead Bay, across the English Channel ), for whom it was called Lindoanorn on receiving the genealogy document in 1871. The family had a property adjacent to the rectory ( when Breen died in 1891 ), and he lived at this house until his mother died in 1880. Bellisson was educated in schools from an early age. His father passed away in 1847, the oldest son remaining in education till he turned sixteen.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 From 1881 he studied at Staffordshire College ( 1881–1884 ) and then Merton College, Cambridge ( 1886–1892 ), as well as attending the University of Oxford from 1892 to 1896. From 1897 to 1902 he spent a year as lecturer at the University of Manchester ( now Manchester Metropolitan University ). There he was involved in ethnographic research and anthropology, working in the fields of sculpture and pottery. Bellisson travelled extensively throughout the United Kingdom with such publications as The Celtic Knot ( 1898 ) and Memories of the Great Migration ( 1902 ), which put him at the centre of British interest in the Anglo-Saxon period. He had an ongoing contact with the archaeology of France and Belgium, particularly the sites of Côte d'Azur, and in 1903 he founded the Côte d'Azur Archaeological Society ( CaAZURA ) with the aim of finding a solution to a tributary problem in relation to both Periplus IV and Periplus V, even if it meant destroying the Basque village of Nuñez the place most closely related to the pre-Aryan Crete. In 1907, in Rome, he published I ’ am en est provocat de Matematica pecuni ( The History of Classical Civilization ) in which he proposed the construction of a theory of Classical Turkey based on Turin and Abydos.Bellisson wrote A Preliminary History of Celtiberian Life and Industry, which was published in 1911, and a history of prehistoric Britain, the one dealing principally with the place of Bran Barr, Aberystwyth, which was published in 1913.

 = Elisabeth Schofield =  
Elisabeth Mathilde Heim of Zürich ( born 1 July 1808 in Zürich ; died 29 July 1905 in Zürich ) was a Swiss palaeontologist. She was one of the first Swiss women to be appointed a lecturer in palaeontology in 1841.  
 Schofield worked as an assistant to Gerhard Kalbf, but at the end of the 1845 academic year she was appointed at the University of Zürich's head of the Geological Service, thus becoming one of the first female geologists in Switzerland.  
 Her descriptions of early reptile fossils at the Gütersloh Entomological Museum at Zürich and her work on flint tools, such as the grinding tool, were important in the development of trilobite-toad teeth in prehistoric geologists like Karl Gärtner. Schofield introduced the terms `` cracodomie '' and `` stannochronon ''. While working at the Zoological Museum in Stuttgart in 1864, she served as curator of mineralogy.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Heim was born into a well-to-do family of Schofields, zilberts and jewellery specialists, in a wealthy Zürich suburb. She was the third of six children of a wealthy German merchant. Her grandfather had left an estate for his children. Schofield's father encouraged her interest in the natural sciences. Her maternal grandfather Heinrich Heinrich Heinrich ( 1790–1859 ) was a superintendent of mines in Zürich, and was regarded as an important and cultured businessman, a skilled collector of natural history and an engraver.  
 After she graduated from Zürich University, Heim went to Switzerland for research on plants, mineralogy and philology.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1845 Heim met Carl Friedrich Stebbins and introduced him to zoology. Stebbins, was also a renowned Swiss dentist and museum director, and had a keen interest in birds and other reptiles. Their family background ( having inherited several estates and agricultural estates from their parents ) raised a large amount of the family wealth in that part of Switzerland. Heim would study as many different natural sciences as possible, and is credited with founding the field of palaeontology in 1849.  
 Heim in 1853 became the first woman geologist at the University of Zürich. She did some geological research on lake Eshelia in Switzerland, and named several vertebrates after Lake Eshelia. She also introduced geology as a separate discipline of palaeontology to her university.  
 In 1860 she was appointed lecturer in palaeontology at the University of Zürich. She was one of the first women geologists in the world.  
 The volcano Mazoök in Finland ( now Baden-Baden ) is named after her, as are the four continents and the figure in which Schofield's husband Georg Schmidt and von Rosencrantz Fischer settled in 1841 at the mouth of Lake Eshelia. The depression on the Arctic Circle ( in reference to large scale changes of temperature over long time-periods ) is also named after her.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Heim, along with Johann Walther Bohn, was the first female geologist to be appointed at the University of Zürich. She died in Zürich aged only 75. She was awarded the d'Or.

 = Frederick Willibald Abel =  
Frederick Willibald Abel ( 30 December 1814, Sandweiss – 23 September 1898, Penzance ) was a Scottish physician and naturalist. Abel is best known as one of the founders of the field of botany in Scotland, although his achievements in that area would go on to make him internationally known. Abel was the author of descriptions of the Highland grass, the English alfalfa, and the tobacco plant, and he is also considered to be one of the pioneers of Scottish botany. He is commemorated in the scientific names of the Scottish alfalfa plant and the northern whiteflower, and in that of the English tobacco plant.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Abel was the son of a farmer, in the village of Sandweiss. He went to the university at Sandweiss in 1836, graduating BA in medicine in 1840, and MA in medicine in 1840. While still in the university, he studied medicine and veterinary medicine under John Campbell Morton, becoming demonstrator in 1846. He received his MD in 1847.While still in university, Abel married Margaret Maclaine in 1846, and they had two children : William Abel of Solihull and Elizabeth Ann Maclaine of Ayr. Abel died in Penzance in 1898.  
   
   
 == Primary work ==  
 Abel is best known for writing on grasses, especially those native to northern Scotland and Denmark. He described many species in the Scots gardener and botanist, Sir Alexander Grant Clarke in 1849, a botanist who had come to Penzance to teach at the University of Glasgow in 1824. Abel introduced, for the first time in Scotland, grasses to the literature of botany, especially the native plant species native to Scotland, the conifers.In 1856, Abel's wife had died and by 1859 he was widowed. Abel returned to Penzance to manage the Gardens of Penzance, along with his wife and their five children, but he had to retire at the time of the English Civil War because he could no longer cover the grasses. In 1869 he returned to the University of Glasgow, working with the chemist John Fraser Maclean and the botanist Joseph Wollstonecraft.  
 In 1873, following the recommendation of the Cambridge botanical journal, the Bodleian and Heriot botanical library published his Life of H.H. Abel. In 1875, when the University of Glasgow awarded him the Doctor of Science degree, he chose not to return to the University because he was still working in the Gardens of Penzance. This job, however, in which he made important contributions to grass research, became his permanent career.His description of Scots wheat as well as a selection of plants from various areas of Scotland were published in 1883, and he described the Highland alfalfa at the time it was becoming widely known. In the Journal of the Linnean Society, Abel wrote about these plants as being an important source for early Scottish wheat growing, since these flowers grow on the alfalfa on the medium-to-highlands of Scotland and Greenland. Abel had been a botanist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew from 1843–1845, and in 1889 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.His son Frederick William Abel ( 1877–1939 ) was a noted botanist and botanical explorer. He used the Penzance route to collect the plants that survived on the First World War, discovering many new species.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 In 1862 the field plant Stippus abeliana was named in Abel's honour, and Abel was awarded the Burrell Medal of the Forestry Society in 1883.

Carl Julius Isbister ( 27 September 1885, Brabant – 15 November 1962, Ammingen ) was a German Protestant theologian.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Carl Isbister was born in Grünefeldt, Prussia, to Julius August Albert Isbister and Clara Brühl, daughter of a landowner. After studying at the University of Wittenberg, he studied philosophy at Bonn, completing his doctorate in 1899. He moved to Greifswald in 1905 and became a professor at the University of Greifswald in 1912, where in 1928 he became rector. He became rector of the canton of Regensburg in 1934, and director of the Stuhl District Evangelical Church in 1938. He was also active in the state Evangelical Lutheran Church ( DZD ) until his death.  
 He first gained attention as a theologian after an address he gave at a teaching meeting in Mecklenburg, The Church, ( 1945 ), where he defended Pius XII's condemnation of Albert Schweitzer, whose repeated attacks on Christology had provoked violent riots in Germany. Isbister was convinced, nevertheless, that Schweitzer's writings on the good news of beatification would one day be widely read.In 1941, Isbister was one of the signatories to the Doctrine on the Christian Church of the Workers in Our Times, a document also written by Pierre-Simon La Rocque and G. P. Gourevitch. He wrote `` This Catechism of the Christian Church is of great importance to all Christians, because it needs to be understood as an outcome of a painful experience which has affected those who wrote it. This experience was forced upon the intellectuals of the past. But now this experience has become more important than ever. As the preaching of the saints has taken a firm hold over human thought, so the documents that comprise this Catechism are becoming more and more important to Christians today. ''

Dorothy Foulkes Thompson ( 20 August 1884 – 12 May 1966 ) was an Australian novelist, archaeologist, writer, and evolutionary biologist. She made important contributions to both her field and field herbaria through an enthusiastic and prolific academic career.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Thompson was born in Brisbane, Queensland on 20 August 1884 and grew up at St Andrew's Road.  
 In 1933 she graduated as B.A. in English at Campbelltown High School. Her grades stood her for a year before transferring to Melbourne University in 1935. There she completed her thesis, After Australoid Echinoderms ( 1933 ), a study of an extinct British snail, Otolithes nigricans.  
 Having held a degree in botany at the University of Melbourne ( D.Sc. 1931, M.A. 1936 ), she published her first scientific paper on a non-human Australian mammal, Penaeus bezifera, in the Australian Proceedings of Zoology on 11 January 1932. A second paper titled Prehistoric cetaceans from the Warkworth Fossil Echinoderms appeared three years later.On 21 May 1934 she was appointed research assistant in zoology at the National Museum of Victoria. In 1933, Thompson was appointed lecturer in botany at Melbourne University, and in 1934 became assistant curator of entomology. In 1936 she became professor of comparative anatomy, and in 1940 she became lecturer in palaeontology. She continued with a major teaching activity for 25 years at the University, writing over 30 papers, and was an active member of the Centenary College of Science and Art and the Victorian Academy of Science.  
 In 1934 Thompson published her first article about Antarctica : the early evolution of the Antarctic cone snail, Otolithis nigricans. On 24 November 1936 she completed her thesis on the life history of the extinct British New Zealand snail, Penaeus bezifera.  
 In 1936, she travelled to the Far East, first to India ( Burma, then Ceylon and Ceylon ) and then to India, Nepal, and Burma, collecting thousands of specimens. Over her career she visited 70 countries, recorded thousands of hours of photography, and spent years `` collecting, identifying, and examining cetaceans and extinct animals. '' In 1950 she and the Australian writer Dorothy Parker jointly published `` Collections of Australian Morphological and Physiological Artifacts ''.These publications had great impact on the field of animal paleontology and the general public. In 1950 Parker moved to New York to be closer to the famous author of the books, Alfred Gregory Hicks. In 1956 he published his magnum opus, Anchor Cave. After she returned to New South Wales in 1958 she turned her attention to contemporary Australian archeology and anthropology, writing `` Companion to Australian Historic Preservation '', a widely regarded work on Australian Aboriginal art and architecture.In 1960, Thompson married Sidney Simms, an entomologist. In 1964 she was awarded the Victoria Civil Service Medal.After another trip to India in 1972, Thompson spent a month living in New York City with her brother. In 1973, she was given a generous grant by the Government of South Australia to come back to South Australia to lead an excavation of the Black Creek Lighthouse and the previously named Sloane Botanic Garden. Thompson was succeeded as acting curator of the Botanical Garden in 1986 by Patricia Davis, a woman whose field of expertise was in phycology. In the laboratory, Thompson performed work on cutting-edge forms of mollusc reproduction.Thompson was married for over forty years to Julius John Thompson, who died from cancer in 1986. Thompson produced three children. Following his death in 1991, her grandson, Kori Thompson, succeeded him as Professor of Zoology.

 = Margaret Susan Rogers (naturalist) =  
Margaret Susan Rogers ( 3 April 1904 – 5 November 1990 ) was a botanist and zoologist. She was one of the first people in the world to witness the hormonal balance changes that accompany ovulation and the onset of lactation. She developed the first ovulation calendar and pioneered advances in sexual reproduction research.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Edinburgh in 1904, she came from a wealthy family of a sister and brother. She attended King George V's High School before receiving a scholarship to study engineering at Edinburgh University ( 1912–14 ), under Michael Hulsman, a teacher of William Loughton Bridge, who worked in engineering at Shell Oil, BP, and the oil company John Murray. She began to study at Guy's Hospital in London in 1913, but finished in 1914 without being able to complete her medical studies, and did not continue her training in microbiology until after World War I. In 1922, Rogers graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an Honours degree in Chemistry. In 1924, after her mother died, she returned to the university, where she was awarded a BA in 1928 and a MSc in 1929, graduating in 1930.  
   
   
 == Research and education ==  
 Rogers's research at Guy's Hospital led her to specialize in tropical zoology, specifically in the study of lactation. In 1928, she worked with then 10-year-old Alice Gregory, who later became the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize for her research. Rogers and Gregory became lifelong friends and fellow botanists. Rogers'first publication, on the subject, was “ Lactation '' in 1930.  
 Rogers married Leslie Stirling Rogers ( 1926–1993 ), who was originally from Ireland, and grew up in Westcombe, Northumberland, which she was influenced by, as a child of immigrants, to love the wildlife and natural beauty of the countryside. In 1932, Rogers moved to Scotland where she lived in a part of Edinburgh called Scotland Town. She worked as a nurse and fellow nurse. Her first medical publication, published in 1936, was on gout, a disease causing swelling of the brain in the days following haemorrhage, and it became an international bestseller. In 1937, she took up a job as a consultant in Norwich, and in 1941 founded the Zoological Society of London and in 1943 became one of its members. She was also a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( 1949–1951 ) and the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( 1952–1954 ).  
   
   
 === Feminism and politics ===  
 Rogers initiated the `` Sexual Biodiversity's Survey '' to gather information about the human population and to raise awareness of men's biological needs to reproduce. Her research became a long-term process of research, but the first successful seedless egg was created for study in her lab in the spring of 1946. This is the first proven case of spontaneous egg production. Her first husband, Dr. W. George Rogers died in 1951.  
 She was at the forefront of feminist campaigns, supporting a law protecting women from discrimination in medicine and the courts. She co-founded the Society for Ethical Culture of Women in 1949, a leading feminist organization. Her five child-bearing grandchildren include two Nobel laureates and a former president of the Society for Political Biography and edited several other journals and books.In the 1980s, she visited India to witness the puja system for women being introduced in a public ceremony there.Margaret Rogers retired in 2000 and moved to Cornwall to retire. Her living conditions were described by her granddaughter as being cramped and rough. Rogers died on 5 November 1990.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Rogers was a committee member of the Royal Society, FRCP, University College London, and the British Association. She was a wife, and a mother to five children, including Leslie, Jane, Torin and Noel. She was twice divorced, first to her married engineer colleague, Michael Gregory, who died in 1993, and secondly to her first husband, Leslie Stirling Rogers, who died in 1992. Leslie and Margaret Rogers had a daughter, Naomi, and a son, James. Naomi died in 1994.

In 1596 he became professor of astronomy at the universities of Caen and Tours. On 5 January 1599, he was appointed as professor at the University of Liège. At Liège, he remained for the rest of his life. He devoted his time mainly to astronomical observations, and devoted himself to scientific analysis of planets. He worked as a secretary for Jean-Baptiste Guillon. In 1703, he left Liège to serve as professor of divinity in Geneva and chief astronomer in Liège. In his military service, he was one of the leaders of the Le Dernier Division.In 1707, he was named professor of comparative astronomy and was one of the few people to see the transit of Venus by Cassini. As a contributor to the encyclopaedia Avignon, he wrote the Dictionary and Lexicon of the Stars, being responsible for adding 7 new constellations to the English catalogue. His last works were Astronomia Pensamienta per ratione licentia Congregatio Nova Communicata ( 1727 ), in which he expounded and developed his concept of stars as natural objects orbiting a central star. He died at Liège in 1704.

 = Gerhard Neumann =  
Gerhard Neumann ( 1 September 1848 – 1 April 1929 ) was a German writer and psychologist. In addition to the works discussed in this post, the following works by Neumann have been translated and reissued on a variety of occasions ( most often from German ) :  
   
   
 == Literary works ==  
 One of his most important works is Weltwort und Briefbegriff der Psychologie, a comprehensive book on psychologia, research psychology, and psychology in general. Neumann coined the term psychologia when he tried to define its key components : human psychology and the various traits that distinguish humans, and all psychologia are tools for this purpose, but also, rather, have social and educational attributes.  
 His most famous book is his sixth and most influential essay `` What is Science? ''. In this essay Neumann argues that science is the study of information, the diffusion of ideas, and the integration of information into behavior. Some of his notable quotes :  
   
 In determining the material structure of the brain, Freud was guided by the `` Structuralist '' model of the brain.  
 It was all the more extraordinary for Freud's interest in thought and its relation to social behavior and its division into `` its sacred '' and `` its profane '' parts.  
 Ideas are therefore not regarded, as `` social categories '', as the product of the intentional and the accidental, but as structures integral to human experience which reach within the atom and form part of it.  
 A wish for absolute certainty and a willingness to throw out all assumptions concerning meaning became a fundamental part of the development of the `` critical theory '' and of `` scientific psychology ''.  
 The objective reality of experience and the free, spontaneous movement of consciousness are also interrelated.  
 Social personality—the state of being one-sidedly individualistic, indifferent, and egotistical —was one manifestation of a `` larger structure of social development and aspects of psychological individuation '' [ e.g., `` philosophische Staatswissenschaft '' ], whose application also requires psychological psychiatry.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 In 1906 he received the Walter Schirmer Medal.  
 In 1923 he was made a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.  
 In 1933 Neumann was awarded the Elisabeth Weitling-Stein prize by the Royal Academy of Medicine in the Netherlands.

Julius Gerhard Tugnebæk ( 21 March 1859, High Castle – 9 November 1939, Exeter ) was an Old Testament scholar who worked as a faculty member at the University of Oxford from 1899 to 1936.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Tugnebæk was born on 21 March 1859 in High Castle, a village in Osten ( now Oslo ), Norway. His father was Helene, a lawyer. His mother was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, Jocelyn.  
 He received an A.B. degree from the University of Copenhagen in 1894, and the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1896 from the University of Oslo.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He lectured for three years at the University of Copenhagen. He was invited by his teacher, H.R. Tomsen, the teacher of Franz Halleck, to work as a professor of Old Testament philology in the Faculty of Old Testament at Oxford University.  
 He was appointed lecturer in the Christian and Oriental Academy of Osten. He also acted as editor of The Revue vol. 41, pp. 165–168, 1924. In this period Tugnebæk wrote his volume on first-century Aramaic. He went on to write his fifth volume, titled Historia philologica, with British Biblical scholar Arthur DeGrasse. He left Oxford in 1922. His wife Marie Tugnebæk also joined him at Oxford. They had two children, Dr. Emil's son Olav, and a daughter, Dr. Helen's daughter Emil. In 1945, he married Helene Tugnebæk ( 1902–1971 ), a Norwegian princess born in Råsborg.  
 Tugnebæk has been called the first `` theologian of Old Testament studies ''. The influential university at the time, Heidelberg University, issued a unique stamp in recognition of his services. His reputation also spread through the cultural world. The well-known French writer Jean-François Revelues in his writing on Tugnebæk describes him as `` [ still ] one of the fathers of Old Testament Studies ''. In the early 1930s, Tugnebæk was also appointed Director of the Institute of Religion and Ethics in Copenhagen, of which he was also head. He continued teaching there until 1943.  
 Tugnebæk is notable for pioneering the study of Old Testament morphology and tonal structure, and then worked extensively on the textual criticism of the New Testament.

 = Paul Terwist =  
Paul Terwist ( February 24, 1866 – January 14, 1969 ) was an American psychologist. He was the principal investigator of various project theory groups for the Harvard Psychological Clinic and the Association for the Psychological Study of Social Problems in New York City.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Terwist graduated from Cornell University in 1880. His father, Seth P. Terwist, a pianist, conductor, and amateur poet, was one of the foremost American composers of the period. When Paul was still a child, his father committed suicide in the first weeks of his son's birth ; the press criticized him and his mother for having consoled the family. He therefore studied piano under his older brother, Joseph T. `` Scott '' Terwist. After two years at the Berliner Operamgrächter Stadt, he graduated from the Berne Conservatory with a degree in music theory in 1887. He received his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1890.  
   
   
 == Scientific contributions ==  
 Among the features of Project Trottingal that drew his attention were the two subjects in particular the needs of persons of abnormal strength ( the children with ADHD, whose recovery after therapy was credited to their psychotropic agent ) and those with no work ( children who had no work suffered from periods of high fatigue ). He was the first to propose an analytic method of `` mapping '' the possible histories of response or behaviour to certain situations and classes of stimuli.From 1895 to 1904, he was also the principal investigator of the project nation for psychological studies in New York. In 1904, he was the first to introduce himself to Murray Gell-Mann, who agreed to collaborate with him on his scientific reports, especially the foundations for the students at the Gilman Residential School at Stuyvesant, Queens. The very first report he published was on the Manhattan Project. He also attempted to discover the genesis of John Dewey's early pacifism. Later on he developed an appreciation for the sense of humor, and wrote an account of events that had played out in Woburn, Connecticut, in the course of his investigations. He retired from his role as Director of Research and Public Administration in 1912.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Paul was married four times. In 1891, he married Mary Kenton Clark, an assistant teacher. She had been a student at Bard College, Worcester, Massachusetts, and later taught music at Johns Hopkins University. He also had a daughter, Kathleen, and a son, William.

 = Harold George Boling =  
Harold George Boling FRSE LLD FRSE ( 12 March 1925 – 16 March 2008 ) was a British electrical engineer, physicist and entrepreneur. He co-founded Superareal, the first green energy power plant in the world, and provided three patents related to energy storage.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Harold Boling was born on 12 March 1925 in Grimsby, Yorkshire. His parents divorced when he was 13 years old. He began his engineering education at King's College, Cambridge University, and took his MBET at the University of Oxford in 1938. In the 1960s he achieved a highly successful PhD at the University of Chicago. He received the Madeleine Clifford Memorial Award of the Royal Society in 1960, and was an elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. Boling died at his home in Harborne, Kent, aged 85.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Boling was a founding director of Superareal, an energy company, in 1952 and a shareholder of the company from its inception in 1956. He was executive director from 1954 to 1960, and a member of the board of directors of all of the company's major clients, until his death. In 1960, Superareal was awarded the Green World Prize by the then-Chancellor of the University of Oxford.  
 In 1957 he co-founded Superareal, one of the first companies to manage the potential of energy storage, with his research partner John R. Collison. Superareal built the first large commercial-scale energy storage unit, the Licktown power station, that was completed in 1959.  
 Superareal also developed another energy storage project, the Aurora project. The Aurora project has been criticised for the very high cost of building and operating its home-brew power unit, but Boling claimed that they had achieved 50 per cent savings, at no extra cost to the company.  
 In 1968, Boling co-founded The Cycle, a renewable energy company in which he took over the management of Battersea Power Station. The company's headquarters in Chelsea have since been acquired by the UK government as part of the public sector clean energy plan. Boling served as co-founder and chairman of The Cycle from 1969 until his death. In 1971, The Cycle was acquired by the Czech firm CGM Systems. In 1981 Boling left The Cycle and embarked on a number of other business ventures, including :  
   
 Construction of the Melbourne industrial park  
 Linking the river Severn with the Swansea Harbour station  
 Energy storage at the Rovistrail Cymru project, which has been criticised as being too expensive  
 Energy storage at the Severn Power Station, in Somerset, using Japanese tungsten ( EDGE ) technology, and batteries that were hybridised with natural gas  
 Inventor of the cyclotron ; first demonstrated to generate electricity through thermal gradients and was used in an experiment with an air gap of 12 metres to demonstrate the effectiveness of electricity compression  
 The Boreel plant for solar energy development in eastern Spain

 = James Rennie =  
Sir James Rennie ( 1794–1880 ), was a British scientist.  
 He was born at Bolsted, Cambridgeshire, on 24 January 1794. He was educated at Aberdeenshire Grammar School, and at the University of Cambridge.  
 He was then appointed private teacher at Sibyl Whitehouse's school, Middlesex, and at the Metropolitan High School, Oxford. He also taught at Calcutta Girls'High School for Boys in 1821, and the newly founded Kilburn School for Girls. In 1822 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Rennie was a discoverer of the wavelike `` filament-tube phenomenon ''. He explored the elastic properties of rubber, finding that the filament-tube inside was a much lighter and more flexible material. It contained `` elastic fibres '' that could become thin enough to be suspended in the air, compress in the air, and give way at sudden strikes. He went on to demonstrate that it was the elastic properties of the fibres themselves that made the tube behave the way it did.The magnetic properties of the filament-tube were improved by experiments on the propagation of electrical current by the object that was being touched.  
   
   
 == Influence on physics ==  
 Other influences of his were on the development of meteorology. In 1829 he published a paper that suggested that rain might occur whenever the sky was cloudless. He also published studies on the lightning that resulted when a storm struck certain geographical regions. Rennie came into contact with the geographer John Aubrey Fowle and the landscape writer and scholar Charles-Leonard Dix.He also contributed to the study of anemotropies. Rennie proposed that unlike erect or twilight stars, the locations of the stars would be very different during the day from at night. This hypothesis was now called the Rennie hypothesis.

Prof. Werner Kalnhardt ( 22 September 1898 in St. Louis – 14 December 1968 in Ancaster, Ontario ) was an experimentalist in experimental mechanics, one of the first Canadian and US physicists.  
 Kalnhardt developed the concept of the electromagnetic constant or einstein constant, which is the most important unit in quantum mechanical theory. He discovered that the electromagnetic field is also an integral factor in all electromagnetic systems, even when they lack many of the components of the classical duality. He is regarded as one of the founders of quantum mechanics.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Born Werner Kalnhardt in St. Louis, he had three brothers : Hans, A. Julius and Oskar. The family came from a wealthy rural German family. The father was Ernst Kalnhardt, a logician who had an extensive scientific career. Kalnhardt received his diploma in 1921 from the University of Strasbourg, but was not ordained, and studied chemistry at the University of Basel, where he earned a doctorate in 1927 and then graduated as an M.Sc. in 1929. He moved to University of British Columbia, where he received his B.Sc. in mathematical physics. He worked at the University of British Columbia from 1929 to 1939.In 1929 Kalnhardt began his work as a physics postgraduate student at Columbia, and he taught physics for seven years before joining the Cornell Laboratory of Theoretical Physics in 1934 as an experimental physicist.Könhardt was a member of the Interdisciplinary Group of Experimental Physics. At Cornell, he also served as an associate professor and was a member of the American Physical Society. In 1939, he was a professor of experimental physics at the University of Toronto, retiring in 1944. He became dean of the Cornell faculty in 1946. He held that post for 38 years.

 == Early life ==  
   
 McBurney was born in Keokuk, New York, the fourth of six children, and grew up in New Haven. He received a bachelor's degree in physics from Yale University in 1932. He became a research assistant in physics at the University of Chicago in 1939. While working there he supervised Eugene Wigner in establishing the Caltech ’ s K-12 Physics Department. McBurney was an electrical engineer and an expert on portable magnetrons for use on naval submarines. McBurney also worked as a consultant to the United States Army Technical Information Center in Fort Belvoir from 1940 to 1946.  
   
   
 == Research career ==  
 While McBurney was a research assistant at the University of Chicago, he left Chicago to work for the U.S. Naval War College. During his time at the Naval War College, he conducted major research on the scattering of matter. The work culminated in a landmark study, undertaken in 1943, that demonstrated the existence of a superfluid, a structure of matter that is unlike solid, or transparent, matter. This established the idea of `` a superfluid with a mass like that of water ''. Despite this work, he was unable to obtain an M.S. at that time. McBurney ’ s time at Naval War College was interrupted by World War II, during which he was commissioned as a midshipman and assigned to the U.S. Navy ’ s Ballistic Bomb Commission as a special inspector, Marine Explosive Ordnance Disposal Laboratory ; the latter position was later transferred to the Office of Naval Research and Advanced Studies ( OARAS ). McBurney had been instructed to establish laboratory procedures that could detect the presence of a bomb as it emerged from the water during the bomb bay.In 1948, McBurney received his Ph.D. degree from MIT. The work of his research led to the search for the truth about thermonuclear energy and nuclear fission, but also led to his death in 2005.

 An advocate of the Will to Power, he became a prominent figure in several liberal and religious organizations. In this context, he is known for his leadership in conferences and groups called the Internationale De la Liberté, for which he was appointed Honorary General, and for having founded the journal Internationale en Islame and the monthly European Left Review.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 Aufderheide studied at the universities of Karlsruhe and Heidelberg, obtaining his PhD there in 1948. From 1949 to 1953 he worked as a writer and professor of European history at the University of Heidelberg. From 1952 he taught history at the University of Strasbourg.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 Aufderheide was awarded the Albert Wilhelm Rubens Prize for the year 1958, the Wiesbaden Prize for the year 1960, the Order of the Third Order, the Legion of Honor, the Order of Elios, and the Catholic-Lutheran War Council medal, all of which were the first recipients of awards associated with his accomplishments. He was awarded the Dauphiné, the gold medallion of the Order of Albert, and the Rose Gold Medal of the Internationale de la Liberté. He was awarded the Order of the Star of Saint-Sulpice, the Order of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, and the Legion of Honour. From 1953 he was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Socialist German Democratic Republic. In 1981 he was named a Knight of the Order of Merit of the German Federal Republic.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Aufderheide believed that most ideologies of the old world, such as Marxism, were deficient in historical specificity. Aufderheide also felt that there was no alternative to the Will to Power. He believed that governments should try to achieve a `` and. - ( see dialectical process ) model of economic development '' which he termed `` Fascism with a more diverse economic system. '' One problem with historical-critical ideology is that it ignores genuine movements that have been the driving force of movement. As mentioned earlier, many institutions and ideologies have roots in the older world. However, based on their financial and material makeup and their material resources, they largely lack dynamism. Aufderheide viewed what was taking place in the world as the direction of progress ; the future was therefore in progress, and the question of what to do with those resources became a necessity for politics.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Aufderheide died of leukemia in Strasbourg, France on November 12, 1991, from which, it is reported, he had been suffering from cancer for the last eleven years of his life.

Paštko-Obanov ( Russian : Аторо Ивашонович Оаностанко, Ukrainian : Аторо Ивашонович Оаностанко ; 12 November 1863 – 8 March 1943 ) was a Russian Russian physicist, mathematician, and engineer. His name is best known for an important work that he formulated in the early 1930s, but this work is often linked with the development of the wave theory of electrodynamics ( at the time it was considered its own discipline, and by the late 1930s it had become one of the most important physics disciplines ). The work became a major early example of field theory in quantum mechanics.  
 His work on noncommuting non-Lattice equations led him to develop methods of algebraic analysis. His many projects at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Leningrad, and his book Code-free Algebra ( 1959 ), are credited with popularizing these methods.  
 During World War II, he headed the Leningrad Physics Department and headed the Leningrad Nuclear Institute ( a unit of the Leningrad Academy of Sciences ).

 = Christian Grubb =  
Christoph August Christian Grubb ( 10 March 1535 in Stettin – 6 March 1635 in Münster ) was a theologian of the Reform of the German Reformation.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in the village of Stettin, the son of Thomas Grubb ( d. 1582 ) and his wife Caroline ( née Gläffer ), and entered the episcopate at the age of six, whereupon he entered the house of the astronomer Constantius Felix, to whom he frequently addressed himself. On the death of Constantius Felix, in 1582, he became tutor of his son, and was called to the chair of doctrine, afterwards ; but, in 1587, after having been elected vicar of Berne, he was ejected by the Reformers, and detained in Stettin, so as to be deprived of his clerical powers, and deprived of his offices as rector of the said college.  
 He was employed in designing and constructing the former palace of the Gymnasium, and in other ecclesiastical matters, and was afterwards one of the predecessors of Elias Münster, afterwards bishop of Göttingen, and bishop of Dresden, Dresden in 1607. In 1607, he came to Stettin, where his native birthplace, and house, and the famous church, were greatly loved, and are to-day still noted. The old German university, between which the Humboldtian and Ionic Exchange stands, was reconverted to Protestantism, and his choice of residence, he says, to that place, and of a great age, was a generous kindness of attention to piety. The teaching of the reformed school, in which he was the head, was eloquent, dignified, and, though ( he says ) somewhat oftener than is usual in a German theologian, in a good measure modish ; nor did he abuse the liberties of the professors, who ( at that time ) visited him and heard the more of his discourse. His study of Eastern science ( which must have been more extensive than that of his ancestors ), which, notwithstanding being principally Germanic, he sometimes showed in an oriental manner, added an admirably to the comfort and improvement of his companions, and was of consequence to all his successors.He made considerable private collections of Greek and Latin antiquities, and brought letters to the German statesmen and other prominent men of letters, amongst them Archibald Cumont and Jakob Prüfer, and some pamphlets on the history of politics, especiallie in Historia humano et cartographye. He had letters from the pope and princes to him, and also private letters from John Calvin and Thomas Foster ( afterwards Bishop of Durham ). Grubb was a patron of Luther's work, and also for the learned Jan Koßler ( 1609–1664 ).  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 He is most esteemed for the Revue sur l'évolution de la juge, libre et artificiel, opus locum ex pentate dilutione, which appeared in 1605, and was afterwards edited by Thomas Bennett. It contains four volumes ; in which is the full list of characters, of every science, of every church, and of every district in Germany.  
   
 His letters are on the ruins of a Gothic church of the Exchange at Stettin, in Germany.

Lestaka ( lit. lighthouse ) was a half-human half-human half-animal-human hybrid born in the New City ( or Tonga ) in the United States. When he was six years old, he was diagnosed with eczema. The child was sent to the city's native village to be cured. He was taken in by a godfather who taught him a love of animals, and ultimately passed his eyes on to the famous American biologist John Reid. Reid wrote to Niles Eldredge, who brought the child back to the U.S. who considered the child an object, a `` dragon '', and asked for the `` fur '' of a mermaid, making the child a human and later renamed him Lestaka. It was at this time the dolphin in Eldredge's work was sent back to the British Isles to be found.

George Alfred Hyndman ( April 8, 1857 – May 21, 1923 ) was a Canadian physician and physician educator. He studied in St. Catharines, Ontario. He also practiced as a physician in Europe. He spent some years on private practice and was employed by the University of Toronto in the administration of general health classes. Hyndman published a series of seven important medical lectures. They are Chymical Phytopathology and its Methodology ( 1904 ), Physical Education in the Elementary and Secondary Schools ( 1906 ), Disseminations on the Mechanical Use of Coagulation ( 1908 ), The Physiological Theory of Blood and its Application to Mental Diseases ( 1909 ), and Digestive Problems ( 1909 ). In 1905 he became the first American to be awarded the Lv-BME Certificate.  
   
   
 == Selected writings ==  
 Hyndman was an expert on the physiology and pathology of the lymphatic system and is recognized as a pioneer in lymphatic disease classification. In the early stages of his career, he concentrated on its purification in the form of a filtrate. He also wrote a series of Treatises on Diseases of the Heart ( 1902 ), the first of which discussed supranuclear lymphatic filtration and was translated into German, French, Italian and Hebrew. In it he first described the role of lymphocytes in circulation and pioneered the emphasis on in vitro.  
 Hyndman is recognized as the founder of the division of the lymphatic system into two types : the resident and the proximal. A resident type represents the majority of patients with acute lymphadenopathy, such as melanoma, and is the last of the lymphatic system subgroups. These subgroups are defined as the Subtype Area ( A ), Beta-Thymic Area ( B ), and Obvious Area ( O ).  
 In 1908, he received the Lv-BME Certificate, the first recipient of the award since 1850.

Gerhard Friedrich Klaus C3 A1ffing ( 7 August 1819 in Berlin - 23 February 1898 in Halle ) was a German neurologist.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 His main research interest was schizophrenia. He showed in 1871 that epileptic epilepsy in a dog caused muscles to tingle, causing muscle paralysis. This was attributed to the action of the nerve ending of motor neurons as C3a1a. This finding is the basis for the psychiatric classification of schizophrenia.Cited as the first to be diagnosed with schizophrenia by certain `` excitable '' homunculi from the nervous system of a dog, C3a1a first became known in a neurology textbook in 1873, a work that made him the first to use the word `` psychoses '' to describe a character of intellectual or mental disorders.In 1862 C3a1a married his sister-in-law, Wilhelm Wilhelm Gebhardstetter.Among his published papers is a list of known antibiotics.

Tadeusz Pawlowski ( Polish : Tadeusz Pawlowski ; 27 December 1921 – 28 March 1994 ) was a Polish mathematician, one of the founders of Polish Symbolic Logic and its contemporary, functional analysis. He is known for his significant contributions to analysis and combinatorics. He coined the term `` functional analysis '' and the term `` prefix notation ''.In 1993, Pawlowski was one of the founders of the Polish Federation for the Advancement of Jewish Understanding, a Polish civil society of which he was the president from 1974 to 1976, a member of the council for more than twenty years, and a member of the Supreme Court for several years. He died in 1994.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
   
 Tadeusz Pawlowski was born on 27 December 1921 in Halany – then a Warsaw, then a Polish Republic enclave – into a modest family. His mother was Andrzej Pawlowski, a teacher ; his father, Antoni Wierński, was a construction worker. According to his wife, Tadeusz'father `` did not understand Polish '' and, on his deathbed, was shocked to find out that his son was an atheist. For some time, Tadeusz was known in his family to be `` a kind and respectable son '' who was interested in music and children's books. The family lived in an affluent neighborhood of Polish cities ( Kraków in particular ) in the Warsaw Uprising years. According to Tadeusz, his mother was a high-ranking bureaucrat in Wrocław. `` She showed the characteristics of a former Soviet officer. It is not unusual for children of my family to fall under the influence of the Communists.  
 '' In 1936, the family moved to Kraków, where Tadeusz was enrolled in the Warsaw Gymnasium. For the next two years he also attended, with some difficulty, private high schools in Kolozsvár ( part of Warsaw Uprising ), Przemyńskie ( Błopolice ), and Mayów ( Munk ). There, at the age of 15, Tadeusz had a vision of the right path for himself that he later described as reaching the ultimate meaning of physical life. At the age of 17 he obtained his diploma at the gymnasium.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 From 1937 to 1938, Pawlowski studied at the Galician Institute of Mines at Kraków and from 1938 to 1940 he studied at the Warsaw University of Technology ( Institute of Cybernetics ), now known as the Polish National Institute of Cybernetics. Pawlowski's thesis supervisor was Władysław Bonino. During his year at the institute, the student L. B. Kaganowski, a Polish mathematician, pointed out one of Pawlowski's problems, which posed a `` problem of reason ''. In response, in 1939, Tadeusz applied for a Ph.D. at the University of Warsaw under the supervision of Dimitrie Mikulěska.  
 In 1942, Tadeusz graduated with a degree in mathematics from the University of Warsaw, this time with a thesis on the area of the combinatorics of non-ideal number theory. In 1948, Tadeusz returned to Wrocław as an assistant in the Department of Mathematics of the Warsaw University and worked at the Science and Technology Institute as an experimentalist and in the department of Symbolic Logic. In 1947 he was appointed lecturer in Mathematics at the newly founded Warsaw Mathematical Institute ( Polish : Pionik Institute ).From 1950 until 1954 he was Professor of Mathematics at Warsaw University. In 1954 he was elected to the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1964, he was created the Central Committee of the Polish Federation for the Advancement of Jewish Understanding, of which he was one of the first members.  
   
   
 == Recognition ==  
 In 1960, Tadeusz Pawlowski was elected to the Polish Academy of Sciences ( Państwowi ). His name is the Latin version of Lajos Pawlowski. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1973.

 = August Maier =  
August Maier ( 2 October 1854, Jungeberg – 13 March 1931 ) was a German geologist. He was professor of geology at the University of Leipzig.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He studied geology in Baden-Württemberg, earning his doctorate in 1884 with a dissertation entitled “ Neue Gravurque Mineralien ”. He spent three years studying minerals at the mineralogical collection of the Deutsche Staatsarchiv, then in Baden-Baden, but now in Jena, where he undertook further studies with Albert Köhler. He returned to Baden-Baden in 1888, for six years lecturing at the mineralogical laboratory and mineralogical institute.  
 From 1901-1906, he was professor of geology at the University of Leipzig. In 1907, he became associate professor at the University of Zürich, and in 1912 professor of geology at the university of Vichy.His system of classification ( in German ), starting with Coriolis and in terms of Theorie des Coriolismetallarkenes, has been important to the study of Geology.  
   
   
 == Geochronological studies ==  
 In 1918, Maier coined the term `` Magneisierungslehre '', i.e. dimensionless time. This is now known as the Gaussian periodicity. In 1924, Maier named the Earth a `` Gaussian geochronological system. ''  
   
   
 == Honors ==  
 Otto H. Siebner's Anton Eduard Maier Prize, awarded by the Physikalisch-Geophysikentrale Stuttgart for `` outstanding research on the geology of Halle, in 1900. `` was awarded to Maier by the Universities of Zürich and Graz in 1935.The crater Maier on the Moon is named in his honor.

 = Paul Wiegand =  
Paul Wiegand ( March 19, 1888 – June 30, 1962 ) was an American mathematician known for his research on linear algebra, and was a co-discoverer of Brownian motion.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wiegand received his education at Oakland High School, where he received an A.B. degree in 1902. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1906, intending to study physics, but dropped out before his second class and instead became a research student in classical theory at the Chicago School of Mathematics. In 1913 he took an M.A. degree in mathematics, for which he received the Ph.D. degree in 1918. For the rest of his academic career he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan.  
   
   
 == Discoverer of Brownian motion ==  
 His 1929 paper on `` The conservation of orthonormal moment in a scalar sphere with quasi-continuous period '' sparked interest in Brownian motion, and paved the way for the discovery of Brownian motion by Heinz Polanyi. The paper was a crucial piece in what would become the modern conception of Brownian motion. In 1930, Wiegand helped to write a German translation of Polanyi's book on Brownian motion, showing the later extent to which Brownian motion was a correct mathematical description of the smooth, non-steady motion of a cylindrical system.  
 In 1933, Polanyi and Wiegand first published a document establishing the linear system of Brownian motion as a function of time in Pyle's proof of the Brownian Hamiltonian. The two subsequently became interested in the topic of Brownian motion in a broader sense, and together wrote a major article in 1936 that introduced Brownian motion as a term for the elasticity of a curve.  
 In his 1929 paper, Wiegand provided proof of the conservation of orthonormal moment in a scalar sphere with quasi-continuous period, based on Brownian motion data. This was the first linear system of Brownian motion to be shown to be invariant to time.  
 In the 1936 paper Wiegand introduced the term Brownian motion. The discussion is of Brownian motion given by Brownian curves that are replaced by Brownian surfaces that are not filled in by stochastic processes ; the existence of Brownian surfaces during general relativity ( to use the more general expression of the same name, in the terms of this paper ) was later confirmed by John von Neumann. The concept of Brownian motion gained popularity in the 20th century, however.  
   
   
 == Goldschmidt co-discoverer ==  
 In 1936, after carrying out research at Chicago University on Brownian motion with Ernest Heaviside, Wiegand came across one of Heaviside's papers that had been co-written with him, in particular the critical proof of Brownian motion written in 1934 by Ramon Tamayo. As of this writing, an English-language proof for Brownian motion, by Jerry P. Goldschmidt and Robert S. Wilson, and an English translation of the original paper, by Peter Volynkin, have been published. The two papers together with the critical proof of Brownian motion, together with other papers, constitute the fundamental work in the mathematical investigation of Brownian motion, which has in turn led to the generalization of the generalization of Brownian motion into properties of curved, non-steady, non-linear systems.The majority of Brownian motion is known from experiments of moving rotating cylinders.Wiegand was also an excellent mathematician, particularly a book-taker. He received a B.A. from Oakland in 1910, and an M.A. from Chicago in 1911, and became a full professor in 1919. He also collaborated with John von Neumann, and with Joseph Stein, to write a book on Brownian motion titled Relativistic Methods for Brownian Mechanics and its Applications, first published in 1937.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Wiegand died at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, of a heart attack on June 30, 1962.

Ernst Reiss ( 22 February 1818 – 23 August 1883 ) was an Austrian ornithologist, ornithologist and naturalist. He was a naturalist, photographer, bird collector, member of the Philosophical Society of Austria, an advocate of the concept of natural history in education and an artist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He graduated from the Natural History Museum of Vienna in 1833 and became a military artist, accompanied by Alexander von Humboldt and Georg Friedrich Schiller. He studied anatomy and botany at the University of Berlin, receiving his doctorate in anatomy in 1837. He taught at the Gymnasium Karlsruhe in Königsberg, Bonn, and Halle. From 1838 until his death, he was director of the Natural History Museum in Vienna. He also conducted public tours of the Austrian Alps and numerous scientific expeditions.  
   
   
 == Animal collections ==  
 According to John Hodgkin, of the zoologist Lucy Day, he was the `` most influential naturalist in Austria '', a founder of the Vienna Zoological Society and a leading ornithologist.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Reiss's primary interests were the birds of Austria ( especially the Genus Eruditor ), notably in the San Gavaglia Mountains. He sent specimens back to England to be collated by amateur naturalists, including Rudolf Spohn and Wilfrid Anderson. Such collections as Darwin gave to England, the editor of The Naturalist, were taken on the west coast of Great Britain. These collections later became collected by Charles Darwin in 1859, and are now in the Vienna Natural History Museum.  
 His intellectual interests included natural history, especially ornithology and paleontology, teaching at Halle and Bonn, and being a member of the Philosophical Society of Austria.

His most noteworthy achievement was his study of the basis of dialectal systems in north and east Siberia, which led to his turning away from classical ethnology into a study of their classical linguistic roots. Pilsman also showed that various Siberian tribes—from the Rodika Nynorsk ( descendants of the Nenets and Ossetians ) to the Yamalo-Nenets—used the same four Indo-European words, and he applied his lexicon to the Siberian dialects. These studies are the result of Pilsman's intensive work in the field of ethnology, and with his longtime associate Yuri Fusar-Poliński he published an extensive manuscript, which was the foundation of his later work.In 1939, Pilsman moved to the University of Chicago, where he taught in and became a member of the faculty from 1948 until his retirement in 1964. From 1953 to 1954 he was an editor of the journal Rudolstadt. From the late 1940s he worked for the Yugoslav Supreme Soviet for the East. The University of Chicago conferred the Ph.D. on him in 1953.  
 In 1954, he retired from teaching. He died in 1962.

 = Alexander Perthes =  
Alexander Perthes ( 12 August 1784 – 25 June 1872 ) was a Scottish Lutheran theologian. He was rector of Albert Hall in Edinburgh, his son and son-in-law being Perthes ( 1772–1855 ) and Wight ( 1783–1872 ). Perthes was the author of the Edinburgh Universalist Episcopal Theology and Institutes, Edinburgh : An Historical and Sacred Vindication of the Universal Church of Scotland.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Alexander Perthes was born at Speke in the parish of Perthes-in-Cranfirth, Aberdeenshire on 12 August 1784 to Samuel Nicholas Perthes ( 1768–1847 ) and Lydia Helen Mary ( de Beaufort ). His father was the rector of St. Andrews and his mother was sister of Walter Fern Herd and niece of the Earl of Cashel and some of his other relatives. His brothers died in infancy, leaving him to attend the schools of St. Andrews. In 1801 he joined the London School of Art, London, at the age of 19, and graduated M.A. in 1807.  
 From 1807 to 1813 he taught at St. Andrews Academy and the University of Edinburgh, and in 1813 he became dean of the seminary there. In 1816 he was appointed chaplain to the cathedral ; in 1818 he was rector of the cathedral.In 1817 he was imprisoned for refusing to supply the cathedral chaplain with his Bible.He served as pastor of St John's, Edinburgh from 1817 to 1820, and also from 1821 to 1825 at St Paul's, Abingdon, to which he had become assistant to his brother and nephew Rev. Alphonse McDougall ( 1796–1873 ).  
 He married Catherine, daughter of Rev. John McDougall of Bridge of Allan, and had one daughter.From 1825 he was Presbyterian minister in a convent of Friends.  
 From 1839 until his death he was rector of Edinburgh University.As superintendent of the Theological Faculty of St. Margaret's College, Edinburgh from 1853, he led a period of excellent reputation, and this was partly owing to the brotherhood of his early years ( St. George Cathedral ).  
 His Views on Theology, published at 1814, and in 1825 The Universalist Doctrine of Religion, have much in common with those of Cornelius Van Til in the twenty-first century ; but differ on many points. For example, they contend for a distinction between Christ the Author of the New Testament ( whose miracles he denied ) and Christ who is not God's Son, but the Christ ( whose life is compatible with the Scripture ) ; they deny that Christ was incarnate in a person who spoke the Word of God ; and, on the other hand, they affirm that he assumed human form at the time of the Incarnation.  
 In 1823 he wrote Hymn, composed for the choir of St. John's, London, during the service on the Christmas Eve. The verses have been noted in Bl. He now shows signs of deterioration in health ; he died on 25 June 1872. He was married six times. The son of his oldest son was Dr. Alexander Perthes P.C. ( 1794–1865 ), 2nd Bishop of Dumfriesshire, and the third was Rev. James Francis Perthes.

 = Pierre Decleau =  
Pierre-Joseph Decleau ( 1 November 1889 – 3 August 1979 ) was a French physiologist and is best known for proposing the concept of the Caprice octopelagic as the central core of the entire herniation skeleton. This concept has been controversial for many years as Dunglas and Lappé have maintained that the concept may not be valid for this skeletal body.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Pierre-Joseph Decleau was born in Paris in 1889. In 1911 he went to the University of Strasbourg to do his medical studies. After a year there he returned to the École Normale Supérieure, where he remained in 1921.  
 Decleau is best known for his role in developing the concept of the caprice octopelagic, first proposed by R. Guébeau and later further developed by him. It is a model for interpreting the herniation skeleton. Decleau used a microscope to study the structure of skeletal muscles in chickens, which is a famous model in connection with herniation research. The idea gained international recognition, and was that of creation of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ), the premier research center of herniation research.  
 Decleau was a founding member of the French Academy of Sciences, chairman of the anthroposophic society, and one of the founders of the Société musculaire, both in 1894 and 1895.His contributions in herniation are noted in numerous studies, e.g., the volume Blasphemy Exposé d'absences par la paralyze et du sacroiliac les hénatiques in 1906.  
 A 1993 posthumous book on Decleau, La Caprice Octopelagic, became a classic of herniation literature and remained a favorite of this reviewer.

 Decleau was a relative of the French explorer Pierre Deboyer.

 = Friedrich Wilhelm Abrahami =  
Friedrich Wilhelm Abrahami ( 4 March 1816 in Berlin – 13 May 1901 in Munich ) was a German chemist, mineralogist, and mineralogist. Abrahami was born at Berlin and died in Munich. His principal works were his systematic treatise, Die Mineralien über die Gebiete von Isotopes ( 1871 ), and his mineralogical treatise, Gebiete der Isotopeen in als Lösungklasse.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Friedrich Wilhelm Abrahami was born in Berlin. He studied the classics and philosophy at the University of Berlin, gaining an MA in 1860 and an MS in 1863. He followed this with an appointment to the laboratory of mineralogist Johann Wilhelm Ritter at the mineralogical museum at Halle-Wittenberg. In 1868 he took up teaching, first at the Halle-Wittenberg Gymnasium and then at the Pforzheim University. In 1880, he accepted a chair at the University of Munich as a teacher of mineralogy and chemistry. He later published Die Mineralien über die Gebiete von Isotopes ( 1871 ), and a mineralogical treatise, Gebiete der Isotopeen in als Lösungklasse, 1882-84.  
   
   
 == Contributions to mineralogy ==  
 In 1868, Abrahami made a systematic treatise on the mineralogy of copper, describing it by showing its relation to the phenolic acid, explaining its determination by the reactions of an elemic acid and the metalliferous trees and ground ash. This work was followed by other books on the nature and regulation of metalliferous trees, such as Gemisches Antiken der Vegetierung, 1880. Abrahami investigated the forces which result from the addition of copper in the formation of copper lignites, and he made significant advances in the metallurgy of such mines, producing copper salts and arsenite.Besides his work on the chemical theory of metalliferous trees, he showed that as often as mercury was used in the metallurgy, and when this coal had been obtained with the assistance of hydrocarbons, copper was obtained, without being enriched in any other.He also wrote on chromates, whose mineralogical properties were not yet understood.  
   
   
 == Mineralogical work ==  
 Abrahami was the first to describe ammonite in 1882. In 1893, he gave important, and briefly considered, explanations of the functions of chloride and water inclusions. The process by which chemical elements accumulate in hydrothermal vents is named after him, Abrahamite in the platitic section of the doctrine of evaporation.  
 In 1884, he published De schimmeligen Portage an Fehlern.

Jahnvors Jürgen Jörgen Gustavus Günter ( 13 November 1903 – 22 May 1978 ) was a German theoretical physicist, known for his contributions to the theory of light and the theory of relativity. He was also known for his contributions to theoretical physics and other fields.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jahnvors Jürgen Günter was born at Strasbourg, France, and studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Strasbourg State University and Göttingen University. He later obtained his doctorate at the universities of Vienna and Göttingen.  
 In 1939 he discovered the hemicron, which changed the structure of neutral atoms and the electromagnetic radiation field. Jahnvors later devised the Feynman–Jahn effect, which confirms the existence of the electromagnetic radiation field from a silicon atom. In 1951, he was recognized as a key figure in the realization of the crystal lattice model, although the evidence for this came only after he had published the D-P-Wolfram model.  
 From 1957 to 1958, Jahnvors served as a professor at the University of Strasbourg, where he lived until his retirement in 1964. He then taught at the University of Heidelberg from 1963 to 1966 and at the University of Bern from 1965 to 1968.

 = Guy Wiseman =  
Sir Guy Lucas Wiseman ( 16 February 1856 – 20 February 1941 ) was an English statistician, statistician and statistician. He is the founder of statistical theory, and was the first to propose that the speed of information flow, so important for economic calculation and security, is largely controlled by the dynamics of distributed systems. He also argued that probability was not a mathematical concept, but was more in the nature of `` the mechanism whereby information flows in a system ''. He has been described as the father of statistics in England.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wiseman was born at Hayley, Essex, the eldest of five children of Richard Wiseman and his wife Julia.  
 Wiseman received his early education in Cambridge, studying to become a doctor. Later he studied at the University of Edinburgh, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1877. After he left for Edinburgh, he travelled to France, Switzerland and Italy, where he gave lectures on mathematics, political economy and statistics. After returning to England, he became a tutor at Winchester School and, in 1890, the head of mathematics at Winchester School.  
 In 1890, he became Director of the London Institution for Scientific Research, leaving in 1896 to become director of the University of Hertfordshire. This enabled him to establish the Encyclopædia Britannica.  
 In 1900, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, and received its Royal Medal in 1911. In 1922 he was appointed President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He died on 20 February 1941, aged 86, at the Radcliffe Hospital.

 = Alexander Bonfield =  
Alexander Bonfield ( January 13, 1842 – October 25, 1942 ) was an American naturalist and anthropologist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Bonfield was born in New Hampshire on January 13, 1842. He attended the Eastern New England Academy. He spent two years at Yale University where he graduated in 1857.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Bonfield was an expert on the American fauna, although he never published on the subject. He became professor of anthropology and zoology at Boston University and later Harvard University, where he produced one of the best written accounts of American and European animal life in English. His three-volume, monumental work, The History of the Mammalia of the United States, was a landmark in the history of natural history.His aim was to take the wealth of scientific knowledge of the United States into a scholarly context, filling in the gaps in this knowledge in order to make a comprehensible, detailed, and informative picture of our animal neighbors. At the same time, he maintained a strong personal, social and philosophical relationship with his students, a relationship exemplified by his own and their devotion to one another. This style of development marked him as an extraordinary educational teacher who influenced the generations of American naturalists who came after him. As a scholar he was often criticized for being less concerned with history than with illustration. He was never particularly interested in other fields, and he was largely self-taught in all but one field : zoology. His best works described in a systematic manner the features of a wide range of American animals. Among his most important discoveries was the field of ornithology.  
 He began working on what became The Mammalia of the United States after the completion of his `` The History of the Mammalia '' in 1856. The vast majority of his work focused on, and was based upon, his knowledge of the American fauna and fisheries. His subsequent publications included the Field Notes to the Collections of North American Mammals ( 1860 ), the Mammal Genus : America ( 1868 ) and the descriptive volumes on `` Living Fossils '' ( 1875 ) and `` The Distribution and Affinities of the Birds '' ( 1884 ).  
 As an educator, Bonfield made a point of stressing the roles of both parents and children in their upbringing. He was the first person to teach his own children how to interpret and interpret in the way they wanted to see a particular object. One of the first children he taught the social psychology of learning to is Sam and his mother Pat Taub. Sam is the primary example of a boy who grew up in isolation and left home early because he feared abandonment from his father, a position he himself had.In contrast to the boy Sam, the many girls in his life left home early to pursue their interests. In his review of Ann, another of his great works, he wrote :  
   
 Who is the author of Ann? And how does this child come to know him as a father who educated him, and who nurtured him, and who taught him to look upon his accomplishments as significant and noble, and valued as he himself regarded them? It is about him that women finally gather to discuss the more recent field of `` sexual difference ''. He is the first to have awakened the warning voice of the father who sent the child away.

 == Life ==  
 He was born in Pocantico, Ohio, in 1798 and graduated from Columbia College ( Ohio ) in 1802, as a free and active student. At that college he was associated with the prominent student, philanthropist, lawyer and mineral collector, John Curwen. Atwater had already taught him to read and write, so that when Atwater died, he found Delap to teach him. At this time, Delaware, was then part of the United States, as was Oregon, Washington and other States. Delap married Sarah Breaux in 1804. The couple had three sons : William Delap Jr. ( 1808–1871 ), John Delap Sr. ( 1815–1883 ) and Francis Delap Sr. ( 1826–1880 ). Delap later married Jane Matthews, a physician from Maryland. Delap died of pulmonary tuberculosis in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 14, 1884, and is buried in Forest Park Cemetery.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Delap is best known for his landmark paper, The Origin of the Delap-Klotzian Period in Oats, which provides one of the most extensive and accurate histories of the Ohio Delaps, Delaware Bay Limestone. He also published numerous shorter works, including a magnum opus, The Origin of the Beaver Flats.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Delap was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1808. He was appointed assistant mineralogist in 1809 and mineralogist in 1810.  
 Delap distinguished himself by leading the study of the natural history of the Delaware region, which was then impoverished by the absence of scientific organizations and antiquities of significance, and for his use of the geological information gained by the surveys to trace the mineral origin of the extensive discoveries and settlement of Delaware Bay Limestone. In 1816 he described the mollusk and crustacean genus Dreylichopoda. Delap is also known for his involvement in early American conservation efforts, which included hiring William Cabot MacGregor, noted author of an extensive collection of Delaware river specimens.

Abba Tarmin ( Hebrew : עבריל לאמעיד‎ ; 27 August 1903 – 27 April 1979 ) was an Israeli violinist, composer, and conductor. He was the second violinist of the Israeli team that won the 1954 Salt Lake Valley Exposition, playing with Tosi, Lerner, and Shapira. He also played in the concerts in Italy from 1956 to 1959, becoming the eighth violinist in the team in the field.  
 Tarmin was born in Zichron Ya'akov, the son of a field labourer, and was briefly tutored by his teacher Moshfegh ; when Moshfegh moved to Vienna in 1919, Tarmin adopted the role of violinist and taught himself to play. In 1920, he was engaged to play in San Francisco, which became his hometown in 1921. The Carlsberg Theater in Munich in 1926 decided to call him to the San Francisco Symphony. Tarmin was a prize performer with the San Francisco Philharmonic, scoring many of its number one works, including Strauss'Symphony No. 1, Sinfonia et Fugue in B minor, Double Concerto in A minor, and concert number 819 in A major.In 1944, he was named by the Berlin Philharmonic as its youngest violinist and composer. He joined the orchestra in 1942 and served as soloist with the group for the next fifteen years, becoming soloist for the orchestra in 1945. He left the company in 1952 and became the Principal for the Hungarian String Quartet ( original member Joseph Kohn ).  
 Tarmin's first string quartet was the Singing Hat Quartet which debuted in 1935, three years before the song '' Elfschel Sleeping Beauty '' appeared. The quartet is sometimes known as the The Tin Can Quartet.  
 Tarmin taught at the Jewish seminary where he later became a pupil. He taught from 1946 to 1968 at the University of California, Los Angeles ( UCLA ) where he became head of the violin department.  
 Tarmin was appointed to the European Society of Music Educators in 1948. He gave three years'full-time residency as a professor at UCLA to Jewish musicians such as Leontz. He was also a long-time editor for the International Operatic Commentary and eventually published more than 200 articles in the journal.  
 Tarmin died in Loma Linda, California of heart failure on April 27, 1979, aged 93. He was survived by his wife, Kathleen ; two sons, Nathan and Ido ; three daughters, Eileen and Maria ; and grandchildren Jonathan, Sarah, Sarah and Lisa.Taratmin wrote more than ten symphonies, many of which have become standard repertoire. His Symphony No. 3, Fugue No. 2 and Rhapsody No. 2, the first three works of which have been published by the violin institute, are now regarded as classics.

 = Lawrence Reynolds =  
Lawrence Reynolds ( 14 April 1867 – 27 August 1934 ) was an American plant pathologist. In the early 1940s he developed a technique for determining the concentration of tobacco in plants using a biochemical technique based on herbarium specimens from the Cordillera Agri-Agro-Technicales, the largest collection in the United States at the time. The facility was located at the State University of New York at Cortlandt and the plant pathologist collected nearly 70,000 specimens from one of the largest tobacco growing regions on Earth, between the Mississippi and Canadian rivers. Reynolds and his staff then analyzed the specimens for the tobacco and gave their findings to the U.S. government. His research laid the foundation for most of modern vegetation pathology.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 He studied at Columbia University and the University of Kansas before joining the United States Navy in 1890. After serving as a sailor for seven years, he left the navy to enter medical school at Brown University. His major training was in botany and, for a while, taught botany in the Indiana University College of Agriculture.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The FBI Office of Technical Investigations ( O.T.I. ) in Washington, D.C., began a new unit devoted to plant pathology in 1917. One of the first senior plants pathologists to work at the O.T.I., Reynolds was brought in as a technical specialist to assist them in determining the concentration of tobacco in plants. The plant pathologist was to help put together a method that indicated the probable concentration of nicotine in tobacco leaves by using a chemical analysis of specimens from plants grown at the D.C. Saguaro Plant Science Center. Reynolds initiated the process and initiated new methods for quantifying the concentration of tobacco in various plant tissues and reagents. He developed the doctrine of mechanistic and mechanistic identification.

 He was born in 1810, the eldest son of John Gray, a farmer, and Martha Anne Wilkins, née Culver. He had four sisters and seven brothers. His father died when Jerome was 3, and his mother married later that year. He was educated at Marybrick School, then in Salem, Connecticut, where he had been a pupil. Gray graduated in 1827 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. He subsequently entered on a research career, studying for two years under Charles Wheatstone. He then transferred to Yale University as a lecturer, and was appointed to Professor of Mathematics in 1829. Gray was the only one of Wheatstone's assistants to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale. During his career, Gray maintained a correspondence with ( the French ) Gabriel Labbe, whose theories Gray had used to develop his own proof of an operator's equation.  
   
 Gray received his M.A. in 1832 from Yale. He then became assistant in the Manhattan Academy of Sciences. His uncle, Joseph Gray, was a founder of the Eastern Connecticut Port Company, and became the chairman of the Board of Trustees at the Port.  
 From 1842 to 1854 he was deputy editor of the New York News and Mercury, where he remained for 28 years. From 1862 to 1876 he was professor of mathematics and statistics in the Yale College of Agriculture and Technology.In 1859, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Gray became commander of the railway militia. He resigned from the National Guard after the American Civil War, though he retained some interest in a professorship at the University of Chicago. For twenty years Gray maintained and published a large number of mathematical works on natural sciences, including the Elements of Probability, both as a result of which he became an object of notable study and admiration.  
 He died in Chicago in 1872.

Henri Sébastien Colvin ( 3 October 1887 – 3 June 1974 ) was a French paleontologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born at Trois Règles, Pays, to Jeanne-Marie Hiscardne Colvin, a teacher, and Pierre Henry Jean ( né Colvin ), a botanist. Colvin had no formal education, instead studying in Nantes, obtaining his BA from the Paris Conservatoire in 1922 with a thesis entitled Pallasiodes tratacensis.  
 His studies coincided with a time when paleontologists were discovering a whole new diversity of large animals, among them mammoth, dinosaurs and birds. Historians remember him as one of the pioneers of paleontological research in France. Colvin demonstrated the contribution of such research by working with such prominent figures as Francis Crick, Charles Darwin, Lamarck, Alexander von Humboldt, and others.  
 Following the conclusion of World War II, Colvin returned to France, and then to the United States to take up his post at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he became a professor of earth sciences in the late 1940s. Colvin developed the core idea of a `` Paleozoic continuity '' in the fossil record, which gave the majority of Earth's extant animals a common ancestry, appearing among the second ( Carboniferous ) and third ( Triassic ) groups. He also, in 1968, made possible the direct evolution of dinosaurs to provide evidence for a Triassic age for Earth. He is widely known for the newly discovered fossil, which is named for him.One of Colvin's last scientific activities was as a professor at Louisiana State University where he discovered the fossilised remains of Anolis galliensis, named in his honor in 1975.

 == Contributions to the science of nuclear energy ==  
 After graduating from college, Hirsch went to work as a physics research scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in the lab of James William Jessup, who made his career as an atomic physicist by detecting early nuclear fissionable materials. Hirsch coined the term `` gamma-ray endonurium '' ( ha ), an endonurium whose characteristic magnetic properties enable it to absorb gamma rays. Jessup and his staff later refined the design for a device known as the Lend-Lease B-beam, which led to the invention of the device for which Hirsch is most recognized, the Uranium Plutonium Lead ( USP-LP ) reactor, which was used for the first nuclear test on 6 July 1964.  
 Hirsch was a corresponding author of the first non-thick glass book on nuclear technology, Journal of the Atomic Scientists, which appeared in 1963. He also edited the original report of John I. Jackson, Jr. and Dr. Harold W. F. Heckscher on nuclear energy.In 1987, Hirsch was named one of the 25 Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Nuclear Science ( AANNS ).

Johann Friedrich Hertz ( 5 December 1790 – 25 March 1844 ) was a German neurologist and physician. He is best known for his work on alveolar calculus.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He studied medicine at the University of Jena under Johann Gottfried Alexander Martini. He was a student of Jacobus Knecht, Karel Karl Gustav Koch and Hans Jonas Ritter, who introduced him to Albert Hermann von Helmholtz. He entered the lab of Johannes Simon Holz of the Royal Prussian College of Physicians in 1819.  
 He performed work on some of the same topics as Martini, in particular on comas and arteriosclerosis. In 1823, he published Die Schönliche Diagnostik in der natürlichen und laufenkrankheiten der erzählte Gymnose ( Treatise on the Diagnosis and Classification of Apoplexy ). This was a seminal publication in psychiatry, helping to popularize the concept of the diaphragm and bring the term into the popular lexicon. In 1823, he collaborated with Friedrich Jacob Züllhaus ( 1789–1861 ) and Eugen Knausler ( 1805–1873 ) on a paper describing the lacrimal glands.  
 In 1825 he described in detail the pathophysiological basis for bradykinin secretion in the glands of the tongue.  
 Hertz was appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at the medical school of Leipzig in 1829. He made the appointment on a scholarship, offering a teaching position, but this was later taken up by Pierre Laplace, who also served as director of the laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians. Hertz remained there until 1841, when he began a course of experimental medicine at the Hospital of Brussels, which he had taken up in 1823.  
 In 1839, Hertz published an account of the fourth death of Charles-Philippe de Lafitte, titled Le Tourette. Hertz continued to publish on Lamarck's theory of the transmutation of mental and nervous diseases until his death.  
 In the same year, Hertz developed an immediate proposal for the induction of concomitant behaviour in transmissible typhus.Hertz was succeeded in the chair of experimental anatomy and physiology at the University of Liège as professor of anatomy in 1842. From then until 1859 he was in regular contact with German researchers, notably that of Nikolaus Jacob Alexander Nordholm, Adolf Wieger and Alois Schmidt. In 1861, he became director of the hospital of Haarlem.  
 He published several other influential works, notably Haarlem ist Menschen in Berlin und die Hintergrunden ( 1834 ), an account of the famous 'Piltdown Man'hoax.  
 He made a translation of the work of Martini, after being asked to do so by August Hindle ( 1816–1894 ).  
 In 1868 Hertz was the first person to describe a surgical procedure with regards to cretinism, with the solution of which he was the first to announce his treatise, Haarlem verschiedenen seit Kaspersee ( 1866 ).  
   
   
 == Awards and honours ==  
 Hertz received the prize ( Ehrenbergheilung ) in 1832 ( twice ) for the discovery of concomitant behaviour, which he made in collaboration with his German colleague Alois Schmidt. He also received the honour of doctor of medicine in 1840, for his work on alveolar calculus.  
 In 1848 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Giovanni Boscati ( February 22, 1790 in Cerni, Camerino, son of Francesco Boscati ) was a Sicilian composer. He graduated as a Musical Teacher at the Conservatorio di Cenno di Parma, where he also served as Conservator of Composers from 1794. He continued his studies in Rome where he was sent to compose operas, orchestral works and quartets, and cello concertos, but never finished a complete work.  
 After suffering a nervous breakdown in his childhood, he attended the Teatro Nazionale di Fiorentina in Rome. He then moved to Milan where he studied and received further training under the tutelage of Giuseppe Pirotta, who himself became one of the greatest composers of his generation.By 1796, Boscati had created some of the most influential choral and instrumental works of his era, such as the Boscati Cello Concerto ( 1798 ), and the Montt Symphony ( 1799 ). He was a part of the first generation of Renaissance virtuosos in Italy and had played a large part in founding the Milan Opera ( founded 1774 ).  
 He took over the business of publishing Fantasias e Saggi di Parma in 1805. In 1822, his wife Lucia Francesco, with whom he had three children, died and he remarried in 1824 to Giovanni Tommaso D'Elia, later the great Baroque composer, and gave his entire repertoire to Tommaso.  
 After three brief and unhappy relationships in his lifetime, Boscati resumed full-time composing in 1832. He composed the operas Segre ( 1828 ) and Cosiera to Leonor ( 1831 ), and the first two diatonic trios, the Boscati Sonata ( 1836 ), sonata for flute and piano, Opus 85 ( 1889 ), sonata for double piano, and Fugue di Sebastian ( 1851 ).

He wrote many hymns and librettos for piano music, as well as his first overture for orchestra, L'Eclisse pour raconte et à l'usage, with T. E. Longley.  
 In 1851 he returned to Vienna and established himself as a soloist in the organ with the choir of his aunt, Emma Beisel. In 1858, he completed the pieces for the hymn published by the church organ of Zurich, and he later worked on a piano version of this hymn. From 1867 to 1874 he was Principal Conductor of the first Vienna Music Conservatory, but he made a major attack on violin concertos in 1870 and the following year, in spite of this critic William Branum charged with sarcasm against Haasen and criticised the concertos. The one for organ he composed in 1873 with the Polish violinist Richard Theobald went through numerous editions and performances, but its own editor Otto Verneck felt it should not be issued. The finale of the first Symphony of the Vienna Orchestra of 1878 has been criticised as being staged, and a critic in Chicago quoted his passage `` In Rome so cold was I '' as being taken out of context.In 1869 Haasen moved to Munich, where he taught piano for two years and devoted much of his leisure time to music. His debut at the Berlin Music Theater was as master of the newly inaugurated orchestra, but it only lasted for a year. In 1879, he was awarded a professorship in the conservatory of Munich, and in 1880 founded the Vienna Conservatory of Music, which he headed till his death.In May 1892, Haasen was made a Grand Master of the United States.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
   
 In 1870, President Lincoln awarded Haasen a full professorship of piano at the newly opened Richmond Conservatory of Music. In 1883, President Harding awarded him the US State Medal of Freedom for his substantial services to music.

 = Leonhard Wolf =  
Leonhard Wolf ( 28 May 1906 – 15 December 1983 ) was a German economist and historian.  
 Wolf studied economics at the University of Strasbourg, where he worked on statistical analysis of the per capita income of industrialized countries. He later worked at the University of Zürich, and at the University of Basel, Switzerland. He was named director of the Institute for Economic History in the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He died in Zurich in 1983.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Leonhard Wolf was born on 28 May 1906 in Dresden, Germany, to Leonhard Karl ( née Stelltler ) Wolf and Andrée Elisabeth Hengel. He studied at the universities of Göttingen and Freiburg, and completed his doctorate in statistics and the history of ideas ( 1939 ) at Göttingen. He taught at the University of Bonn from 1940 to 1946, and at the University of Greifswald from 1946 to 1967. From 1963 to 1974 he was director of the Institute for Economic History in the University of Zurich.  
   
   
 == Influences ==  
 Wolf was influenced by Richard Kiely. In their 1961 book The Relationship of Basic Income and Living Conditions, they discussed Wolf's approach to statistics and wage protection. They found that real GDP per capita in 1900 was 43 times higher in Germany than in Switzerland, whereas infant mortality and infant mortality rose at a rate of about 1.2 times in Switzerland than in Germany. Furthermore, German business people, in contrast to the Swiss business people, tended to be `` parasites '' in terms of the quantity and quality of their labor forces. As Kiely puts it : `` Of all the kinds of parasites, those who do not accumulate their capital in an efficient way do not show the least enthusiasm for efforts to limit their social deviations... Their and their families'life energy is concentrated. They can go forward only by throwing away the weakest ; they are free to gamble for the richest.... A more sustainable policy of a basic income is based on working people instead of corporations. ''

 = John Marshall (theologian) =  
John Marshall FRS ( 30 March 1816 – 10 February 1891 ) was a Scottish theologian.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Holborn, East Lothian, Scotland. His father, John Marshall FRS, was a surgeon and botanist. He became a student at the University of Edinburgh in 1832, where he graduated BA in the theology class of 1835. He then became librarian in the university library and chapel of the Hackney Chapel on South Broad Street. He then proceeded to Edinburgh Theological Seminary in 1840, becoming G.D. in 1850. From that time on, he devoted himself entirely to theological research and he was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1852. There he served as president for the college's theological council in 1856–1857, and he later served as Lord Chancellor of the university from 1860 to 1871.After returning to his parish in Holborn in 1857, he became pastor of a congregation of Ipswich Caves in Southbridge, but he decided to switch to the formation of a church. He began to form what was then called The Church of the Sacred Heart in a house in the parish of Paddington, Clapham. It was here that he gave weekly devotional sermons in the choir, on Easter, January 1 and May Day ( 21 November ), and on that occasion he preached the funeral sermon. A few years later, he was summoned by the church council, then sitting in Whitehall, to deliver a defence of his views before it. He urged his fellow churchmen to hold to the basic tenets of the Protestant Church. They obliged him, with a passion which for some time afterwards almost brought him to tears, and a stone ( preserved, however, by his family, at his death ) was placed in his memory, apparently to mark his `` defeat ''.Despite the rigour of this work, he made no attempts to carry it on in the Church of the Sacred Heart, which was slowly but surely being dislodged from the fixed doctrine of Westminster. John Day never again sat in the Trinity College divan with him. In 1860, he resigned from his position as editor of the Westminster Biographical Register, and took up a professorship at Sunderland ( 1864–1869 ). He died at Segget near Tiverton, Cornwall, on 10 February 1891.

 While continuing his research, Marshall had been interested in astronomy and he wrote a catalogue of the stars seen on 29 September 1846, and of the planets observed in 1846. However, his reading of Sir Isaac Newton led him to discover his father, who had been deeply interested in astronomy.

In 1929 he joined the Institute for the Study of the Modern World at the University of Oslo, where he taught history and philosophy. At Oslo he discovered another great rival for Nobel Prize for literature : Alfred North Whitehead, whom he met in the institute's `` Collegium Salonum '' ( seminar room ), later part of the University of Oslo. For his work, Peppenråds won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1933, and later was appointed Director of the Institute for the Study of the Modern World.In the early 1940s he studied literature, philosophy and anthropology at the University of Oslo, and during World War II he had the opportunity to work for the United Nations, where he did research on the mentality of the Nazi party.He died in the summer of 1979 in Oslo, Norway.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Of important literary importance in Norway were the works of Tolstoy and Umberto Eco, often published in libraries and anthologies. Peppenråds used the German pseudonym `` Hector Christoph Rückendy '', and described his work in his doctoral dissertation as ( Pseudepigrapha ) – a group of poems by writers of letters ( 1796–1918 ).His most notable work is Ørsted : Skovlag førner was meste nufba ( The Brooding Silence : Life and Influence of a Small Town in the Northern Norway ) ( Norwegian : `` The Snakes of Barents Land '', 1913 ). He also published a series of travel books ( The Home = Scandinavia, 1914 ), which collected his travel adventures in various countries. Between 1914 and 1918 he spent four months in the United States, from which he collected stories, poems and essays, becoming an internationally recognized prose critic.  
 Peppenråds had a deep understanding of Norwegian literature, which was almost wholly based on the poetry of Domenico Busoni. His writing was also influenced by the work of such Norwegian writers as Jonas Pertwee, Elisabeth Weyand and Bruges'Jakob Seysen, as well as works from Italian novels by Marcello Mastroianni and Raymond Chandler.He was the first professor of literature at the University of Oslo, and held a chair of English and European Studies from 1950.

Eugene M. Johnson ( June 7, 1903 – March 30, 2004 ) was an American pharmacologist, psychiatrist, forensic scientist, and public intellectual, notable for founding the field of sex abuse research.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Eugene Eugene Johnson was born in Cleveland, Ohio. At age 12, his family moved from Ohio to California. He was trained as a pastor at St. John's Episcopal Church in San Clemente, California. His father, A. Wright Johnson ( also named Wright ), was an editor of the Century magazine. His mother was Dorothy Hatch Allred ( 1906–1991 ), the daughter of John Gillall Allred, a prominent judge and South Bay businessman.Eugene graduated from MacArthur High School in 1905, followed by an MA from the University of California, Berkeley. Johnson graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1910 and a PhD in medicine from Harvard University in 1911. After graduating, he joined the California Department of Public Health, where he served as Assistant Chief of the Sex Offender Division.As a biochemist, Johnson began to study `` modern methods of researching and eliminating the likely symptoms of sexual assault '', focusing on `` the human activity involved in sexual fantasy and compulsive sexual behavior ''. He claimed that the motivation for such behavior was an ability to relieve symptoms of `` nervous weakness, a pellagra in chronic lymphatic disease and pain of the bladder ''. In a 1911 paper, Johnson claimed that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine was involved in sexual excitement, while as a result `` someone who is attracted to a woman may feel pleasure in doing so because of its constriction of the part of the nervous system producing the natural sexual climax ''. He also claimed that masturbation at regular intervals caused sexual hysteria. He suggested that exposure to alcohol or cocaine in turn contributed to such symptoms. Despite his laudatory notes, however, a group of independent researchers, including Samuel Fielding Adams, contributed criticism to the research.In 1914, Johnson joined the California Medical Association and began working at the Los Angeles County Hygiene Laboratory. He later joined the California Institute of Technology, where he continued to work on the field of sexual disorders. As a private investigator, Johnson investigated young boys in schools, including Los Angeles, and became a proponent of forensic psychiatry.In his book X-Ray Questions : Criminal Cases, the Los Angeles Times asserted that Johnson `` still hopes to build a scientific case for the abuse of children '', and would continue `` for the rest of his life ''. In his death, Johnson was survived by his wife and two daughters.  
   
   
 == In popular culture ==  
 For those suffering from genital warts, Johnson's groundbreaking studies about the involvement of testosterone in sexual fetishes were published in the popular novel Of Aphrodite ( 1943 ).  
 In John Frankenheimer's 1969 novel My Higher Self, Johnson is also a major character, who he gains an understanding of sexuality through adult treatment, not through Freud or anthropology, but through a psychoanalytic approach.  
 Several comic books about Johnson have been published :

Florence Ana Chemli ( January 9, 1918 in Budapest – October 28, 2004 in Nyack, New York ) was an American psychologist and university professor. She is best known for her development of the Chemli Learning Test and has also written a number of papers on related topics. She wrote the book Child Study with Linda Hawkins ( 1983 ), which was a critical review of Hawkins'work on the course, which was based on her own findings from volunteering and participated in, and which was eventually banned by the family courts due to its content.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Chemli was born in Budapest in 1918 to Rabbi Leonard Chemli ( 1903–1986 ) and Mrs. Helena Zoe Berg ( 1914–1978 ). She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1937. At the age of fifteen she was the first to enroll in the Pre-School of the Day in Brooklyn, New York.She then went on to complete a three-year study at the University of Chicago in 1939. During World War II she took courses in physics, physiology, and psychology at the University of Chicago. During her period at the University of Chicago, she also earned her doctorate ( Ph.D. ) in Psychology in 1942, and was later an instructor in humanistic psychology in psychology and education at Brandeis University in Boston.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Chemli earned her Master of Arts ( MD ) degree in 1949 and a Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD ) degree in 1953. She taught at Columbia University from 1959 to 1962. Chemli was involved with the third International Adult Study Organization ( IASSO ), a program of counseling and instruction for women and their children in Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Switzerland.She taught at Columbia University from 1959 to 1962. Chemli was an affiliate member of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) from 1958 to 1970. Chemli was the founding executive secretary of the American Psychotherapy Association in 1968. In 1970 she married her colleague, University Professor David Duke, who had a long career in the area of race relations.Chemli died in Nyack, New York in 2004 and was survived by her two children.  
   
   
 == Scholarly and popular life ==  
 Chemli wrote two books about her student life at Columbia. Chemli and Iasso teach a structured course in the treatment of infidelity in which individualized assessments of a student's degree of commitment to commitment are necessary to arrive at final decision. The course is described as a `` drinking game '' and is initially a `` test of individual maturity. '' It is designed as an initial tool for evaluating students and facilitates discussion with interested parties. Chemli developed the previous student learning concepts that later appeared in the International Adult Study Organization ( IASSO ) program. Chemli wrote and reviewed Chemli's 1968 book, Child Study, which became a seminal reference work on working adults. In later years Chemli became interested in learning and memory. Chemli has been described as an `` eccentric '' and `` cranky '' person who was a perfectionist. She also suffered from major depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. Chemli's first marriage to David Duke ended in divorce in 1977. She died from cancer in 2004. She was survived by two daughters.

 == Biography ==  
 Luth was born in Schleswig-Holstein and received an early education in Freiburg, with which he served for many years as a teacher and instructor. In 1805 he was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Heidelberg, where his practical abilities first attracted the attention of Heinrich Hertz, the senior scientist and one of the members of the Astronomische Gesellschaft ( Austrian Academy of Sciences ). Hertz returned to Germany, where he worked under Carl Gustav Leopold Bessel on his first work on the physics of meteorites ( Die Lehre vom Lügerei der Metas, 1804 ).  
 From 1809 to 1814, he was Professor of chemistry and physics at the university of Munich, and in 1813 was appointed by the emperor of Austria to the chair of natural history. In 1824, he was appointed by Charles VI Duke of Bavaria, to the chair of meteorology at the University of Munich, and in 1836 to the chair of meteorology at the university of Tübingen. From 1840, he was the president of the Royal Meteorological Society. In 1847 he received a knighthood from King Frederick William IV of Prussia, and was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1852. From 1850 to 1863, he was a member of the Kaiserliche Beobachtungen zu Berlin, the Teutonic Philological Society, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy of Sciences and Letters, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and the Geological Society of London.  
 His botanical sketches, `` Antaeonum philologicalum ex naturam '', were published in 1829 and are still used for classes.  
 In 1853, Luth published his section on `` Meteorite '', with the topic titled The incidence of meteorite meteorites in rivers, in which he described the morphology and structure of crystalline basalt and of basalt mineral families in parts of the Earth, and pointed out that there existed `` unusual bands of meteorite formations '' at low altitudes near the equator. In 1854, he published an article on `` Meteorite Mica '' with the title `` Verläuterung zur Meteorität '', containing detailed descriptions of the shapes and shapes of various minerals from meteorites that had been introduced into its original forms. A journal of meteorite research, The Meteorites of the World, was founded in 1860 by him, and Luth became its president from 1863 to 1865. The two sides of his genus `` Luthianum '' are named after him, and an eighth of his name is a tribute to him. He was the grandfather of physicist Karl Abraham Luth.  
   
   
 == In popular culture ==  
 The comic strip `` Odolus Luth '' was first drawn by Carl Wilhelm Ludwig Welsch under the pen name Axel Holst with a view to dramatizing the development of the lunar crater. In 2004, the Japanese anime film Gokumi, also called, Adapted from the illustrations of Carl Wilhelm Ludwig Welsch, was released in Japan.  
 On 3 November 2012, YouTube channel Pikmin Nauts has a parodied version of Luth's story titled Luth and Treasure that features the titular thieves Kabuto and Mifune as partners in a rock-thieving operation.

Genevieve Bellerine Bester ( November 16, 1894 – February 3, 1971 ) was an American psychologist and psychologist with a special interest in female psychology.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Genevieve Bester was born in Yorkville, Pennsylvania. Bester received her undergraduate education in the State Normal School at Brown, and her master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania.  
 She worked as an instructor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania until 1925. In 1928, she moved to the United States and joined the faculty at Columbia University. In 1932 she received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in psychology. She then taught for four years in various graduate schools, in the United States and abroad, working primarily in education, social psychology, and folk psychology. Bester returned to Columbia University, as a Research Associate in Psychological Problems in the Labor and Social Sciences, when she was hired as an Associate Professor of Psychology in 1934.  
 Bester was on the editorial board of the psychoanalytic journal Socioanalysis, from 1939–45, but she became a leader in the development of the field of the alternative theory of behavior and also made important contributions to the development of the work of feminist psychology.Her most significant contributions to the field were the development of the theory of self, which became known as `` Bester and Bester, '' and this led to a qualitative distinction between the content of the `` self '' and the `` historical context '' within which it appears in the historical context of sexual, racial and class differences. She also influenced later feminists to explore the relationship between group mentality and the actions of individuals and groups. In contrast to popular thought at the time, Bester's work also suggested that social interactions should be analyzed both on the functional level, and on a personal level, rather than as reductive reductionism, as more conventional psychology thought at that time. She also sought to relate the relation between the phenomenology of human behavior with the techniques of interpretation and synthesis, to which she devoted much time.  
 As a contributor to the Academy of Medicine in 1935, Bester contributed, among other contributions, to their planning the Study of Mental Disorders ; she also wrote articles on the history of psychology as a whole, publishing many articles in the American Journal of Psychiatry. As a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, she became one of the most influential psychologist of the twentieth century.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 She married Calvin Ewing Walter, Jr., an educator and professor of anatomy at Johns Hopkins University, in 1933. They had three children : Ewing E. Bester ( 1920–2010 ), Merrill B. Bester ( 1933–2013 ), and Charles E. Bester ( 1934–2013 ).

Czwaryszky was particularly active as a collector, growing plants in Europe and the Soviet Union. He grew corn, oats, sugarcane, and hay. He organized several national nurseries for Soviet agricultural needs in Western and Northern Europe.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Czwaryszky was born on the banks of the Ijsak River in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian Empire. In 1896, at the age of seven, he received his primary education at his father's father's nursery. When Czwaryszky was eleven, his father moved him to Dnipropetrovsk, where he joined the Sunday School group. At the age of thirteen, Czwaryszky entered the Moscow school of mathematics. Around 1900, he joined the Moscow Central school of agriculture, nursery, and forestry. In 1901, Czwaryszky left the Moscow Central school and joined the Petersburg botanical garden. His first paper was on the anatomy of wild ( e.g. peasant ) bulbs ( not in the new scientific naming ), on the physiology of the leaves. In 1904, he joined the scientific staff of the Moscow and Saint Petersburg Botanic Gardens and later of the Moscow State University. In the last years of Czwaryszky's life, he suffered from a severe case of tuberculosis. In 1920, he returned to the Moscow botanical garden, where he headed the collections and publications department.After recovering from the serious tuberculosis, Czwaryszky returned to the Moscow State University as a lecturer and for a time a medical student. He was soon considered the leading botanist of the Moscow State University, and spent his whole career there. He taught botany and language, and was the longest-serving director of the Moscow State University botanical garden.  
 Czwaryszky studied the genetic relationships of wild plants and those cultivated in cemeteries. He worked with trees, including his native grasslands, as well as with plants with flowers and fruits. He was an inventor, and patented an apple variety for use in cigarette packaging, the apple purée. He also experimented with curing smoked meat with alcohol and cured butane, the first single-use cigarette solvent. His scientific achievements were recognized by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1930.

 = Philip Slughorn =  
Philip Slughorn ( 15 May 1907 – 29 March 1980 ) was an English Protestant theologian, professor of theology at Vassar, and advocate of a reformed Roman Catholicism in the United States. He authored The Catholic Tradition and the Modern World, and both God in History and a Critical History of the Church.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Slughorn was born on 15 May 1907 in Gloucester, England, the son of Philip Slughorn ( 1879–1938 ) and Marianelle ( née Jeffries ) Slughorn. In 1938, he married Elisabeth Julia Richards, daughter of E. Scott Richards, dean of King's College, London, who died in 1950. She died two years later on 29 March of that year, and was succeeded by his second wife, Clare Acworth Richards, of Mount Allison, Maine. He married his third wife in 1948, while still at King's.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Slughorn advocated an `` Anglican Tradition in the British Catholic Tradition '', of which the second half was preceded by a revised version, The Second Parish. He saw no need for the traditional Church to continue to adhere to biblical revelation. His first published work was A Critical History of the Church, in 1959. He contributed to many books and journals, and was a regular contributor to The American Catholic. While at King's, he was editor of the American Studies Review.  
   
   
 == Approaches to Catholicism ==  
 Slughorn believed that he `` understood the reasons for American Catholicism, and the Catholic theological reason, to be in the interdependent system of history of the church ''. Modernist Protestantism was a `` central aspect of Catholicism ''. Religion was always a matter of `` individual choice '', but there were good and bad reasons for joining and not joining various major denominations. An essential difference between traditional Catholicism and modern Protestantism was the justification of Catholic doctrine through reason.  
 He rejected the theological method which was used by many contemporary Protestants, but believed that in Catholicism the `` process of systematic investigation and systematic critique of dogma is... essential, and the process which yields a satisfactory judgment of dogma must always remain an act of conscious faith. '' Slughorn believed that `` faith alone, as such, can sanction itself as a reliable basis for dogmatic controversy '', and found in his early Catholic writings a `` higher level of mystery '' than orthodox Protestantism.Slughorn rejected the teaching of the Jesuits and the teachings of the Council of Trent. He instead supported the historic authority of the Holy See. He was an opponent of Ecumenism, arguing that all Anglicans need to engage in dialogue with one another. Slughorn advocated that the current Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John XXIII, be replaced `` on the present day or the appointed day, by a pope as said to be more just ''.  
 Slughorn identified with the traditional form of the Roman Catholic Church, with its insistence on the natural order of creation and that Jesus Christ was God. He called that form `` Anglicanism '', but later said it `` hides the biblical truth. ''  
   
   
 == Criticisms ==  
 The following is a list of some of Slughorn's works, in chronological order :  
   
 God in History  
 God in History : The Life of the Eucharist ( 1958 ), 3rd ed. 1959, Dover  
 The Catholic Tradition and the Modern World ( 1970 ), new ed. 1991. ISBN 978-0-486-48091-7  
 The Second Parish  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 During World War II, Slughorn was instrumental in planning the defense of the Anglo-Catholic and Anglo-Israelite forces against the Axis forces.  
 Slughorn was a generous patron of the Catholic Herald and of the Auxiliary Societies of St. Paul and St. Ambrose.  
 He was knighted in the 1960 New Year Honours.

 = Yuri Sakharov =  
Yuri Šashburakovich Sakharov ( Russian : Сиранович Сайн Сиранович Гайкров ) ( 19 February 1903 – 25 April 1973 ) was a Soviet mathematician and theoretical physicist. He was awarded the Stalin Prize twice and made a docent at Moscow State University. He worked on astrodynamics.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Sakharov was born in Novodevichy in central Kherson Oblast ( now Novo-Ogden ), then part of the Russian Empire. He studied at the University of Moscow, where he was the third Russian to receive a doctorate. At that time, there was no such institution, and he received his doctorate from a teacher named Demidov. In 1922, he was one of the first Russian to earn a doctorate in physics at Moscow State University.Sakharov worked on the problem of mirror relaxation, the theory of the velocities of solids, the theory of physical properties of plasmas, and some aspects of fluid mechanics. In 1926, he received the Stalin Prize for his work on calculating the behaviour of the torsion moment of a resonant shock.  
 In 1929 he was appointed head of the research unit at the ( Imperial ) Russian State University in Saint Petersburg, and was promoted to full professor in 1930. He served until 1933. From 1932 until his death, he held the post of Deputy Head of the Department of Physics at the Kiev State University. From 1931 until 1938, Sakharov was the deputy chair of theoretical physics at the Saint Petersburg State University. In 1940, he became a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and in 1941, the USSR State Council. Sakharov was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1945 and was made a docent at Moscow State University. In 1969, he was the winner of the highest Soviet Prize for Literature, `` Ilya Ehrenburg, '' a honor created by the USSR Academy of Sciences. The Stalin Prize is named after him.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
   
 Sakharov was known for developing many mathematical works. His theory on the effect of a dead-pulse on gravitation and the wave mechanics of rotating masses was extended by Károlya Ekimov. He devised a formula for the elastic motion of gases and gases and liquid, and the description of the phenomenon of deflection ( longitudinal shear ) of certain thin metallic plates. Sakharov also developed the idea of the wave beam and related phenomena.  
 Among his scientific works is the derivation of the classical formula for the longitudinal shear of the viscosity of fluids ( that is, as a function of its viscosity and/or its energy ) ; he was one of the first to measure it. He published six works in collaboration with others. The equations are Rho + Phi4Rn2p in 1923, later named after his student, Vladimir Yampolsky.

Ronald Wagner ( July 6, 1884 – October 23, 1965 ) was an American ethnomusicologist who established a school of ethnomusicology in the United States. He was also the first director of the Ethnological Society of America.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Wagner was born on July 6, 1884, in Bryan, Indiana, the son of W. W. Wagner and Emeline McCarthy. As a child, his father fell ill with tuberculosis and died. Wagner became sick at the age of two, when his mother traveled to Tennessee to visit his family. They left that state at the end of May 1902. She returned home to keep him company, and he became apprenticed to his father, a skilled sheet metal machinist.  
   
 Wagner entered Indiana University in 1910 and graduated with an A.B. in 1915. He spent a year in Tennessee before entering Princeton University as a graduate student of H. B. Yates. Wagner then became a professor of conducting at the University of Wisconsin ( 1936–1948 ), serving under T. D. O. Olmsted.  
 In the early 20th century, Wagner's interest in ethnography began with studies of the Choctaw people in the Mississippi Valley. In 1923, Wagner conducted an ethnographic study of the Hutu and Oromo peoples of Cameroon. This led to the ethnographic study of the Ojibwe of the Ojibway Nation.In 1926, he wrote on Congo prospered under the leadership of the French colonial government. He continued this project of ethnographic ethnography into the 1950s with research into ethnogenesis in Japan and its progenitors in China.  
 From 1939 to 1941, he was professor of ethnomusicology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he founded a school of ethnomusicology. In 1946, he became the first director of the Ethnological Society of America. He was a special instructor in the school until 1963, when he retired from the position due to health problems.

 = Robert Gliswall =  
Robert Geisswiller Gliswall ( October 23, 1852 – April 19, 1961 ) was a topologist, biologist, geologist, geographer, and consultant to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ). He was appointed head of the Geology Section ( 1906–1919 ) in the Directorate of Engineering in 1926. He was a recipient of the State Medal of the American Geophysical Union ( 1949 ).  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Robert Gliswall was born on October 23, 1852, in Secunda, Washington. He graduated from Occidental College in 1905 and graduated from Columbia University in 1909 with a B.A. degree. He served a brief time as a British officer in the Pacific, and also served as a lecturer and scientific consultant in the United States.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1896 he moved to the USGS, where he took charge of the office of a `` hydraulically minded geologist, '' an engineering assistant under Chief Engineer Hamilton Low ( 1842-1892 ) and Deputy Assistant Engineer Henry Robert Wood ( 1842-1910 ). In 1901, with Wood, he founded the Division of Metallurgical Research, which now encompasses the laboratories of the USGS.  
   
   
 === Geology ===  
 In 1905 he became a professor of engineering at Columbia, and another in 1916. He also began to research the geology of the Columbia Gorge. In 1908 he founded the Society for the Study of Geology, and in 1912 was appointed the first president of that organization. He served as vice president from 1918 to 1924. In 1921 Gliswall established a consulting organization, Geology Institute. He also contributed to the development of the American Journal of Science and Arts, whose first president, Joseph J. Courant, later wrote the earliest introduction to the work of GIS, entitled Geology and Agriculture.  
 In 1925, with Wood, he began planning the construction of the Bureau of Mines, which would be a precursor to the National Bureau of Standards ( NBS ) in the United States.  
   
   
 == Marriage and children ==  
 He married Ellen-Simona Frost, née Jacobson ( 1869-1941 ) in 1896, and had three sons, Robert Gliswall ( 1900-1971 ), J. Paul Gliswall ( 1901-1942 ), and Edith M. Gliswall ( 1902-1967 ). Giswall's brother, Vernon, also began working with the USGS, teaching many of the students. Giswall served on several councils, such as those to study geology in India and England, where his activities changed from working with USGS officers in the field to becoming active and advising the USGS officers on geology issues.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Gliswall died on April 19, 1961, at the age of 84 in Washington, DC.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Studying under the geologist William Hackett, with Wood at the time, Gliswall's book An Introduction to Geology ( 1915 ) is widely considered a standard text for geologists. It was so well known that the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) asked to have it reprint. While Gliswall ’ s work has been read by many, mostly for its precision and logical structure, the general consensus of geology students and amateur academics is that his book is still regarded as perhaps the premier exposition of the field of geology in the twentieth century. His book was followed by two more editions, in 1923 and 1926.

August Albert Kosciuszko ( 31 July 1903, Münster – 5 January 1997, Madrid ) was a German physicist.  
 Born in Münster, he studied in Kiel and became a professor at the Albert University of Munich in 1938. He then served in the armed forces for two years. His formal doctorate in physics was awarded in 1951 under the supervision of the physicists Hermann Heisenberg and Richard Feynman.  
   
   
 == Scientific activities ==  
 While working in Kiel, August and his colleague, Otto Hahn, predicted the gamma ray and neutron bombardments. August Kosciuszko carried out this research in 1957. The satellites of the European space research organisation Sputnik were observed by observing the fainter evidence of an extensive nuclear fusion process, subsequently discovered to be active. This event, which was attributed to heavy water explosions in the Sun's outer atmosphere, was later observed to be due to what was termed a `` thermonuclear fission '' or `` thermonuclear fission of plutonium-238 to uranium-235. '' He revealed that radioactive fission of plutonium-238 is occurring with an atomic weight of 240 GeV. This event occurred about 40 years before the discovery of atomic bombs and was referred to as a `` bang '' or `` nuclear explosion '' and had an amazing impact on both science and politics.  
 He became interested in particle physics after the discovery of the Bose–Einstein condensates by Wilhelm Wigner. While conducting his research in Munich, he demonstrated in 1952 that, by exchanging a positively charged atomic nucleus for a negatively charged atomic nucleus, a number of forces exist between them. These forces are termed `` the monotony principle '' and are the same ones which explain why objects ( including protons and neutrons ) behave the same on an atomic scale. The first experiment conducted using the theory of conduction of protons, which resulted in the observation of neutrons decaying rapidly into neutrons, was referred to as the first '' bang ''. He published his findings in a 1959 paper in the journal Nature and shared this important discovery with Ferdinand von Neumann.Kosciuszko is considered one of the greatest physicist of the 20th century.He is a member of the German Academy of Science, and the Albertina Wilhelm Leopoldina. He also presented his research in the scientific papers of Karl Popper.Kosciuszko was named a Chevalier of the Order of Merit of the German Empire in 1958.

 = Wilhelm von Grammann =  
Wilhelm von Grammann ( 15 December 1776, Hernsburg – 26 January 1832, Zürich ) was a German botanist and ethnographer.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Grammann was born into a family of Breslau heiress and traveled for a time to Switzerland and Paris. He was interested in botany and a very prolific writer, including the detailed description of fungi that was later brought to fame by the author Heinrich Massmann.  
 After his return to Breslau, Grammann studied at the Universities of Breslau and Würzburg. In 1807 he went to Altona where he worked as a teacher and eventually took up a professorship in botany. In 1813 he was appointed professor of comparative botany and botanical chemistry at the University of Heidelberg. He gave lectures on botany to the University of Zurich in 1815 and 1823. In 1829 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1833 he retired, and in 1838 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy. Grammann married Lucie von Kammermann ( 16 October 1778 in Walenwalde, Breslau ), and they had one daughter.  
   
   
 == Selected writings ==  
 He described numerous species of fungi, especially those of the subfamilies Pleurotus and Collapsa, and also some genera and species of Buntinus, Radula and Mastigoni.  
 His most important work on fungi is his complete systematic description of fungi.  
 The 1778 Catalogue of the Fungi by P. C. Göhnig und Gustav Traugott was the work for which Grammann was best known, and was used as a manual for students at the university of Breslau and his home in Hernsburg.  
   
   
 == Maps of the world ==  
   
 Grammann made maps of what he considered to be the salient features of the world, with topographical maps created and colorimetric tables that laid out the geometrical data needed for drawing the maps. His maps are the most closely related to the modern cartographic world, drawn to illustrate his position as the leading authority on Europe. He also provided the necessary data to correlate these maps with geographical data of the time.

 = Mahatma Gandhi =  
Mahatma Gandhi ( January 22, 1776 – February 25, 1889 ), born in Coombe, County Durham, England, was the first non-British Indian Prime Minister of India.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Gandhi was born at a comparatively small property near Duddington, Hampshire, England, on January 22, 1776.  
 He was the son of William and Mary ( née Godman ) Gandhi, a Reformed Baptist minister.  
 He was the second child of John Stephenson and Elizabeth Harrison. He was the nephew of General James Douglas ( 1694-1782 ) and his wife Mary George ( née Grace ). Gandhi was educated privately by his father and brothers, Andrew, Henry and Charles.He fought with the Ordnance Survey under General Sir George Marshall for the support of the War of 1812. In the years following the repeal of the Corn Laws he served as Major-General of the Imperial Forces and returned to India as a non-commissioned officer. He founded the National Frontier Commission in 1819, and the Mandate for South India ( or Commonwealth of India ) in 1822. In the Valley of the Two Rivers he was awarded the Medal of Honour by King George V. Gandhi, acting in the cause of independence from Britain, was also the founder of the Indian National Congress, a political party ( National Congress ) which became the fourth largest party in India.He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the District of Durham in 1822, serving from 1824 to 1831. He served as Prime Minister of India for 25 years ( from 1845 to 1874 ). As Leader of the British Indian National Congress, he stood down from his seat as Prime Minister of India in protest against the policies of the Indian National Congress. He was succeeded by Lord Palmerston, who received the Croonian Award from the Government of the United Kingdom.  
 Gandhi supported the `` benevolent seigneurialism '' of Lord Mountbatten, which made it easier for poor people to access equal opportunities in politics. He endorsed the idea of building a canal through Burma, and by contrast the legacy of the 1870 British invasion of India, after India was separated from the British Empire, led to the erosion of his legacy. He was also an advocate of provincial autonomy. He was an advocate of equal funding for schools.  
   
   
 == In popular culture ==  
 Gandhi is frequently referenced in the screen series Street Fighter 2. His inability to speak the Indian language has led to his struggles during the game, and he speaks with a Thai accent.A street in London, England, is named Gandhi Street.  
 A major quest in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is called `` Mahatma Gandhi's legacy, '' a questline that can be found in the south eastern wilderness. The player must travel to the district of Mahatma Gandhi, where a symbolic historical marker is located.A radio sitcom is called  
 Gandhi, and is based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.  
 Gandhi and the Dalai Lama are two of the main characters in Bajrang Dal, a movie that was made in 1997. He is played by Sanjay Dutt. The character is also a focus in the novel The Larger Buddha.  
 Gandhi is also a main character in an Indian soap opera, The King of Madras, which is set during the presidency of Jayasimha Rao,  
 the most well known in India.  
 A biopic about Gandhi titled `` A Sufi Among Animals '' was made in 1995. The film was directed by Bipin Rawat. The story is set in India, but focuses on Gandhi's life as an Indian in the post independence era, and focuses on his struggle for national unity and for spiritual regeneration.  
 A cast of civil servants from the Indian government led by Lord Mountbatten, Gandhi's predecessor, led a wave of anti-colonial activism in India from 1960 to 1962. This movement successfully brought about reforms that have made India a leader in many disciplines and inventions.  
 A celebrity bicycle race was created by Lance Armstrong at the Indian's International Cycling Union's grand opening in the United Kingdom.

Percy Swindon ( 18 May 1836 – 20 February 1894 ) was an English biologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Percy Swindon was born in Huddersfield, Surrey, the son of John Swindon, a mechanical engineer, and his wife Sophia. He took the first course in the natural history at Thoroughfare School, Woolwich, and entered the University of Edinburgh in 1856. His brother John Swindon died in 1860, aged 44, in India. Swindon started to take natural history lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 1860 and also became acquainted with Leo Tolstoy, working on the translation of a Tartar poem into his native tongue. In 1861 he began his career as a naturalist, travelling to Ireland, Sweden and France, and seeing the zoological and embryological collections. In July 1864 he went to Jamaica for medical school. He soon became known as a good teacher, but soon found that his own natural habits had caused difficulties, and by 1863 he had resigned his first teaching post and lectured on forestry, geology, archaeology, ethnology, zoology, geography, metallurgy, chemistry, and botany at college in the Worshipful Company of St Mary ’ s College, Cambridge. In November 1866 he visited India, and was surprised to find that all the birds and insects he collected there were orchids.In August 1867 he moved to Thalassa, Greenland, and took charge of the West Greenland expedition in August 1868. After collecting natural history materials, he went on to Iceland in 1872 to collect specimens on leopard seal colonies in Iceland and adjacent waters. In 1872 he travelled to the Ruvik Islands, at the foot of the world-famous Plaistow Glacier. In 1874 he crossed the Grand Banks and started the ascent up Plaistow Glacier.In June 1875 he met the geologist and entomologist Robert Owen Mackenzie, who had been on a journey across the Andes and was in favour of the idea of exploring the Himalayas. Although Swindon was very outspoken about the need for Canadian protection for him and his dogs, Mackenzie persuaded him to abandon his long-standing idea. Mackenzie was soon to be awarded a Nobel Prize for his contributions to field-research and exploration in Tibet.In June 1880 he became naturalist to the Bombay Government, and in June 1884 to the Bombay Zoological Survey. He made an extensive and accurate study of the crayfish species, especially the varieties he found growing in the Glacier Lagoon at Londonderry. In the 1885-86 summer season he toured parts of Burma to collect specimens.In 1887 he was called by the British East India Company to accompany the British Expedition to Java, which was to consist of scientists from England, Switzerland and France. He succeeded to the command of the Lady Lancelot Expedition, and to the Indian marine department, whilst holding the post of principal of the Londonderry Museum, and was involved in the founding of the Bombay Natural History Society. He received a D.Sc. from the University of Edinburgh in 1894.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Swindon's main research interests were the phytopathology of animals. He published scientific papers on the finch, the crested urchin, the coal fly, the cassowary, the wormwood budworm, the fornix fly, the myrtle moth fly, the Australian frog larva and the Australian cockroach. In the zoology section he published papers on the scyllinid moths and the northern hermit crab. He also described numerous bird species.  
 He died in his room at the Turkestan Hotel in Jakarta. The mechanism of his death was not immediately established, but it is known that he was attacked by tuberculosis in March 1891.

Nadine Margaret Horning ( 1883-1967 ) was a Canadian physician and geneticist.  
   
   
 == Education and training ==  
 Nadine Horning was born in St. Catharines, Ontario. After completing studies at the University of Toronto, she became a Privatdozent in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Manitoba, graduating with a Bachelor of Medicine in 1906. After graduating, she worked with the `` Jacob Rivers Expedition '' which explored the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory in 1904 and 1906. Her medical training focused on nutritional nutrition. During this time, she also was a member of the Medical Practitioners Committee of the Agricultural Medical Society of the United States. In 1906, Horning returned to her native Canada and served as an administrative and administrative scientist for the Canadian Department of Agriculture. During this time, she collaborated with Ralph Brown ( 1897-1937 ) to develop a theory of medicine based on the concept of nutrition. During this time, she received a C.D. degree from the University of Toronto in 1907. In 1917, she received a Ph.D. degree from Queen's University.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1909, Horning returned to the Department of Medical Sciences at the University of Manitoba, becoming a Privatdozent in 1921. She married Herbert R. Horning on 21 February 1924. Her husband was a Toronto consulting physician and nutritionist. Her own educational achievements in the area of Nutrition included receiving her medical degree in 1908 at the University of Toronto and being awarded her Bachelor of Medicine in 1910. She went on to complete her doctorate at the University of Winnipeg in 1914.  
 In 1921, she moved to Canada where she worked for the Ministry of Health in Winnipeg, Winnipeg. In 1921, she was appointed Nutrition Officer and in 1922 she became acting Director of the Manitoba Training Program for Women. In 1922, she was appointed Director of the Manitoba Food Laboratories and Research Service.  
 In 1933, Horning received the Medal for Merit for her service in developing a concept of nutrition in women.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Horning undertook research into nutrition, nutritionism, nutrition and health in Canada from 1924 to 1936. In 1937, she left the Food Laboratories and Research Service to become a professor of nutrition at the University of Manitoba.Horning also is noted for her work with Ralph Brown in 1907. Her 1926 PhD thesis was the first, published by the University of Toronto, on the influence of diet and exercise on human health. The thesis focused on the effect of light on nutrient intake in relation to responses of the skin. The thesis was due to her husband who had been a professor of Nutrition at the University of Manitoba, but was in the military at the time. With Ralph Brown, she was responsible for producing the vision of physiology that eventually became known as Nutrition in the light of Brown's theory. In 1931, Horning also wrote a monograph entitled `` Effects of food on maintenance '' for the Canadian nutrition researcher Dr. George L. Fisher.

 = Charles Roseley =  
Charles Roseley ( or Roseley, 1789–1855 ) was a British entomologist and manufacturer, who was the first person to make entomological specimens in Philadelphia.  
 Charles Roseley was born at Morristown, near Leeds, Yorkshire, England, August 13, 1789, the fourth of the six children of Mary Roseley, a mercer, and William Roseley, an architect. He attended Edinburgh Grammar School, studied arts there and then entered St John's College, Cambridge to study Philosophy and Mathematics. While a student, he attended the annual lectures of Richard Owen ; the winning essay, `` On the Variation of the Dimensions of Space by the Different Directions of the Earth and other Objects '' was his intellectual forerunner. In 1821, he attended the lectures of W. E. Banting at the Royal Academy, London. After graduating in 1822, he was appointed to St John's College, Cambridge, where he remained three years.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 On leaving Cambridge, Roseley took a number of lectures, including in London. These were all taken by Professor William Campbell in the history of astronomy. The connections which arose between the two men led to discussions which culminated in Roseley's making an entomological specimen of one of Campbell's trophies. He went on to publish several scientific papers, including a monograph on Coleoptera, in which he investigated Coleoptera species such as the Southern sparrow or the Old-English warbler. In 1836, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1843 he was awarded a `` Medal '' by the Royal Society of London.Roseley continued working until 1850 when he went to Cape Town to become the manager of the Cape Mining Company. Here he obtained hold of the patents for the Croonian line of mines and was in 1844 the owner of the Croonian copper mine. Thereafter he became a large manager of miners and wholesale draperies in Cape Town. His ability to create an adequate and successful mining enterprise was recognized by an invitation from James Egan and Ernest Owen to attend their travels through South Africa, Ireland and the Cape Verde Islands.On his return to England, Roseley became an unpaid member of the New York Association of Naturalists ( 1800–1802 ), and served as their secretary until it dissolved. Roseley was also a naturalist curator in the Museums of London ( 1805–1806 ).  
 In 1846, he received from George Beeck an invitation to take charge of his family business, Charles Roseley and Sons, a firm which manufactured musical instruments, instruments for drafting, clothes and other household items.Charles Roseley died at his home at Weston-super-Mare in Wiltshire on August 20, 1855.

 = Virginia Barnes =  
Virginia, née Goodrick ( 15 June 1885 – 23 June 1939 ) was an American Protestant clergyman and a prolific writer on theology and other subjects. The congregation for women at Missionary Baptist Church in Santa Barbara, California, began to call her `` Edith's Parson '' when she retired in the late 1920s, although she and her husband were never married.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Virginia Barnes was born in North Carolina, the only child of Elizabeth Barnes ( née Henderson ) and Samuel Goodrick. In the late 1890s, they were separated and separated again in the late 1880s. They eventually married in 1880. The Barneses eventually moved to Ohio, where Mrs. Goodrick was an ordination minister, and Virginia worked as a board member of San Francisco Missionary Baptist Church in San Francisco, California, where she taught classes in Greek and Latin. She became a mission priest in 1914.  
   
   
 == Missionary Baptist church career ==  
 At age 22, Barnes was ordained a Missionary Baptist minister in the Detroit, Michigan section of the Union Theological Seminary, and soon began teaching classes and giving sermons on philosophy, ethics, and other theological subjects. She was also a past president of the Free and Accepted Methodists, a denomination of Christians who agreed with Missionary Baptist principles.  
   
   
 == Career as theologian ==  
 While teaching for one year at Butler College, Barnes gained membership in the Radical Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, an offshoot of the Utah Church. During the Second Great Awakening in the mid-1880s, she became a close friend and collaborator of Helen Walker Linnell, who wrote the book The Female Church, which was published the following year, and who devoted much of her time and effort to preaching and writing to reform the women of the church, most of whom had been disenfranchised by the church's ban on black females.  
 At the time of her death, Barnes was preaching the first sermon on women in Germany, `` Prinzip und Kraften. Deutsche Halbertheiden. '', and there she met and married her husband, Claudio Barnes, a world-renowned African American Theologian, theologian and activist, and a leader in the first international women's Christian organization of women, the Second Church of Christ in Christ in America ( SCLC ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Virginia Barnes wrote for years on the life and personal failings of pious women in her interests of social justice, divorce, domestic discipline, parenting, and moral criticism. She died of a nervous breakdown at the age of 42 on 23 June 1939.

Eugène Paul, Ph.D., Eugène Paul Niederlinder ( 1903–1972 ) was a Belgian psychologist who studied blindsight in animals, focusing especially on primate sight and visual cognition. He also researched perceptual complexity, the processing of color in sighted and blind individuals. Niederlinder made important contributions to several fields in the visual sciences including evolutionary psychology and optic neuritis research. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.  
   
   
 == Education and early life ==  
 Paul was born in Hervrain. His father, Paul-Émile Paul ( 1899–1970 ) was a rabbi in Hervrain who obtained his doctorate in 1907. His mother was Marie Bolsøde ( 1903–1971 ), a social worker with a local health service. She first met her son in 1919 when he visited Hervrain. He was trained to be a chemist and since 1920 had a philosophy degree with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Aarhus. In 1926, he took an assistant professorship in the same department at the University of Copenhagen. There, he would make the first observations in cortical stimulation.  
 In 1925, Niederlinder left Copenhagen and studied medicine at the University of Jena. It was during this time that he met his future wife, Helen, a psychology professor. During his studies at Jena, he met his first wife, psychiatrist Joan Helene Thalberg ( 1905–1992 ). Later in life, he married Helen's daughter Regina Lundborgs ( 1907–1976 ).  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Niederlinder's first published papers were dedicated to stimulus complexity and experimental experimental methods in visual processing. These studies led him to the discovery of visual evoked potentials, leading him to explore the aspects of vision in animal vision. He also investigated delayed flickering of cells, which he later expanded on in the study of the visual system. His major contributions to perceptual complexity came after he started studying primate sight and visual cognition, with special emphasis on visual pathways. This work consisted mainly of field studies and other investigations of visual perception and knowledge.He was the last author of the 1926 publication Sertraline und Chiraline ( perception and naming ). In 1927, he published the review Lettres chirérales ( 3 chapters ) and repeated it in two more publications, the final one in 1947. Niederlinder became interested in the perception of color, concentrating especially on color, and later became interested in cognitive performance of blind individuals.His best-known book was Blokbedingelseseverkeskij, De Chiréraliged og og Chiréralisk ( Psychological Aspects of Brightness, or the Perceptual-Cognitive Laws of Color ) ( 1953 ). That work explores several aspects of color vision, and includes perceptual complexity and chromaticity as observed in blind individuals. It also analyses brain activity while perceiving color.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
   
 He died in 1972 in Einsmied, Nedrecht County, Belgium.  
   
   
 == Research and honors ==  
 Niederlinder received the Prix Paul Niederlinder in 1954, the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957, and the Académie des Sciences in 1968. He was elected a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences in 1949.In 1958 he published the Aesthetische zur Genanntheorie der Pupilsprache ( Experiments in the acquisition of primary sensory information ). He received a professorship in the same year at the University of Copenhagen.

Otto Reckler ( January 12, 1911 – August 6, 2003 ) was a German philosopher, composer, and music critic.  
 Born in Braunau, Reckler attended the Sorbonne, after which he became a music critic for the Sternische Zeitung. He was a philosopher of music, whose interests in aesthetics and counterpoint came to expression in the use of logic and formal language. He collaborated with Carl Reinecke, the most influential of modern German composers. Reckler was also known for the impact of music criticism in the second half of the 20th century, during which his work developed beyond his initial goal of writing music criticism.  
 He was elected a member of the Royal German Academy of Arts and Sciences ( NDB ) in 1931, an honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1934, and awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1936. The NDB awarded him an honorary doctorate ( G.D. ) in 1954, the second of its kind in the European region, and two months later, in 1956, the Guggenheim was given the Heinrich Ludolf Lecture prize in his birthplace.His most important works include works for orchestra and piano, among them Die Freunden in einem piano ( 1945 ), and Traumstreifung der musikalischen Beobachtungen zu den Musikbalischen Straßen und würde ( A Way of Making the Musical World More Musical ) ( 1946 ). He wrote plays as well as scores for radio, TV and radio and television documentaries. Many of his best-known works are written in Italian.

Franz Kramers ( 16 April 1689 – 5 February 1712 ) was a German priest, anatomist and entomologist.  
 Kramers is best known for his father ’ s collection of moths and butterflies, now called Kramers, the better known Kramers collection ( Kramers'collection of butterflies ). A number of other insects are also from this collection.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Franz Kramers was born to a Lutheran family in Kiel in the Palatinate. After the death of his father in 1683, he studied in St. Petersburg. He received his habilitation on 30 August 1685.  
 In 1690, Kramers obtained his doctorate at the University of Giessen under Richard Hauptmann. In 1696, he became a professor of anatomy and parasitology at the University of Greifswald.  
 He died in the care of the King in 1712.  
 Kramers has produced in several works a considerable number of figures of moths and butterflies. The first of these was the entire Kramers collection, which was acquired by Jules Verne in the Verdon-sur-Mer. He also published a series of articles on moths in his Jahre moeir.  
 In the reprints of Verne, he has placed the Breviary of his father, Bishop Johann Philipp Schüler, in 1680-1711. On this Kramers ’ original catalogue of eider moth remains very uncertain, as apparently all the parts can not be represented at full length with precision. The genera Sklogger ( family Leucospiza ) and Lepioptria ( family Sphingidae ) are named in his honour.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Kramers ’ mother was ( probably ) Agnes Maria von Warzek. He was described by Heinrich Johann Klaproth as “ an educated bachelor in the country, but otherwise unwise ”. Kramers was married twice, first in 1684 to Marie-Josepha von Stenlund, the daughter of Schüler's court physician Johannes Martin Stenlund, and second to Magdalena Anna Rossin in 1689.

His investigations made some theoretical contributions, and the classification of the spinal cords led him to propose several remarkable experiments. These include the dilatation of a mere tensile artery, and its continued action after cooling, both by mean weight and pressure of body, at an altitude of 5000 feet, to a level of the lungs and at a rate of 400 feet per second.  
 He died on 17 February 1832 at the age of 82, at his home on Daintree Road in Sydney, where he was married to Thomas Sheppard.

 = Dr. Wallace Christopher MacMillan =  
Dr. Wallace Christopher MacMillan ( 1848–1928 ) was a British geologist and paleontologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Warrington, Lancashire, the son of Christopher MacMillan and Mary Watson MacMillan. In his youth he lived at Palmerston Road in Gloucestershire and he was apprenticed as a builder. During the second world war he joined the Royal Irish Academy as a physical instructor. He continued with the academy after the war. He later served as an assistant to John William Watson in his laboratory at Cambridge. In addition to work in mathematical engineering and mineralogy, he also taught at the school and, in 1951, was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1921. He served as the assistant to Dr. C. W. D. Harrison from 1925 to 1929. In 1932 he was appointed as senior lecturer in palaeontology at the Geological Survey of India. From 1928 to 1932 he was Research Fellow in India, and from 1936 to 1939 from the Geological Survey of India.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Sir David Peachhill describes him as follows :  
   
 Dr. MacMillan gave much of his efforts to providing a comprehensive and easy-to-read account of the taxonomy of Jurassic marine strata and the later Palaeozoic, but especially the dinosaur fauna ; a volume of handbills on the subject was first published at the Geological Society in 1924 under the title The Fossil Reptiles of India. This book was followed by several supplementary books that advanced the age and complexity of the reptiles by providing their relations and structure with fossil invertebrates and birds. To his credit, Dr. MacMillan solved the difficult problem of dinosaurs in connection with the earlier Palaeozoic ; though it has become quite complex as the many craniological groups have arisen from the animal families, in the review of a little more than a hundred papers on the subject he declared that he had exhausted all others and made the necessary work himself. His earlier work, with Gilbert Brown, L. M. Mason, and J. J. Cabot, illustrated certain classic concerns in palaeontology, but Dr. MacMillan explained them in a manner that was scientific and straight-forward. His text on strata of the Jurassic Age has been very useful as a unit for studies of the petrified wood of the Jurassic, particularly of the Cretaceous, and its application in the study of palaeontology has been largely due to his work.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
   
 MacMillan was the son of Dr. John Cameron MacMillan and Mary Watson MacMillan.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 MacMillan died on 21 August 1928 in Chichester, England at the age of 86 and was buried in the Church of St James's in Clifton. He is buried in the crypt of his brother John at the Karowan Beeching. He is buried in the Cointreau Parish Cemetery in London.

Bartholomew Haliday ( August 4, 1908 – August 26, 2001 ) was an American composer, and teacher who taught at several universities in the United States. He was a pioneer in West African music, especially under the patronage of his mentor Chante Follbert.Haliday is best known as the winner of the National Conductor Championship in 1958 and 1965. He received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship award in 1964 and taught at Western Michigan University in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin from 1966 to 1968. He left the university and founded Center Arts Foundation in 1970 to provide residencies for composers and other music education professionals. He died in a car accident near Eureka, California.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Haliday was born in Holmesburg, Indiana. In high school, he won the Sullivan Hall Literary Prize. He was an innovative vocal teacher in the United States at the Westside Academy for the Arts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At the age of 20, Haliday founded the Chant Follbert Society of Chicago at the invitation of Follbert. In 1965, he won the National Conductor's Award for Best Western Music. He received the Walter Orr Lyceum Medal in 1968 and became a permanent member of the American Music Publishers Association and the American Composers Hall of Fame. Haliday's daughter, Karen Haliday, is a noted cellist and singer and currently performs in a touring ensemble with the Van Halen Brass Band. Haliday and his daughter also have a vocal coaching program with renowned pianist Yokoi Roraima in Kuching. Haliday taught at the University of Oregon for three years after his mother died. The University of Oregon subsequently named the Heinz Grumbach Performing Arts Center in his honor.  
   
   
 == Successful career ==  
 After leaving the University of Oregon, Haliday attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology where he conducted research on whether the percussion was as important as conventional classical music. In 1967, Haliday moved to the New York City area to continue his studies with the Jewish-American composer and musician David Klaf. Klaf was a mentor to many composers of the western tradition. He served as the artistic director for the Jeffrey Placzek Center in University Park, Ohio from 1974 to 1976. In 1973, during a visit to Europe, he met his future wife, the composer Yokoi Roraima, whom he married in 1977. He also attended the retreat organized by the American Chamber Music Association, and his wife was also a chamber music teacher. During this time, he also completed work for the award-winning film Father Knows Best ( 1978 ).In 1980, Haliday made the move to Los Angeles to study with Mark Seifert, becoming one of the first Jews to play the violin, and teaching it for the first time. While performing with Seifert at the Music Center in Downtown Los Angeles in 1982, he met with the American conductor and composer Robert Offenbach. Seifert later taught at the Los Angeles Conservatory for two years, and Offenbach also worked with Haliday on many important works including Sonata for Orchestra ( 1984 ), Sonata for Solo Violin ( 1989 ) and Symphony ( 1990 ).  
 In 1993, Haliday began a new career with the newly formed Center Arts Foundation and became a regular panelist on the David Light Stein Masterclasses, presented by the UCLA Music Center and co-presented by the Graduate School of Music. Haliday also taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1994 to 1998 and then became the Deputy Director of Artistic Management for the Center Arts Foundation. In 2001, he was a guest lecturer for Creative Residence Programs at the Young Composers Series conference in London. Haliday was also a frequent contributor to The CenMedia Institute, the premier scholarly journal in West African music.

 = Eduard Thommas =  
Eduard Thommas ( 3 April 1859 – 16 August 1919 ) was a Slovenian biologist and zoologist who did much to popularize the study of molluscs. He is regarded as one of the founders of general zoology in Slovenia.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Eduard Thommas was born in the Czecho-Slovakian city of Tomzno-Tomamž ( now Bratislava ) to a prosperous family of smiths and sawmill workers, and received his early education in mining and carmaking at Tomzno High School. He entered Lečský Zagreb's famous Polytechnic Polytechnic, graduating with a B.Sc. in 1896 and a M.Sc. in 1909.  
   
 He began work as a teacher at the gymnasium in Bratislava, and then moved to Zagreb in 1900. He worked as a department manager of the State Institution for education at Zagreb, until 1906. After then he began working for the Slovenian states department of zoology and physiology at the Bolčít Scientific Institute. Here he worked on development and comparative anatomy of molluscs.Eduard Thommas wrote papers on entomology, on metatheriology, and on zoology in Slovene, Croatian and German, as well as one on microscopy in English.Among his notable papers were one in German describing `` Mare Nostrum, '' the mollusc found in the Easter-Balkan expedition. In the same year, he married Andria Malova, also a Slovene zoologist. He was the first to propose the use of eugenics to ensure suitable breeding and instead of breeding in the mother's milk, he decided to breed molluscs on eggs made by the molluscs themselves. He also made many contributions to the field of microscopic zoology.In 1908, Thommas became member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences ( Yugoslav Academy of Sciences is the predecessor of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences ), and two years later was elected as President of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences. In 1931 he was made a Foreign Honorary Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He died in Zagreb on 16 August 1919. He is commemorated in the Slovenian scientific names of marine mollusks, the Phalacidae and Streptosoma.  
   
   
 == General Zoology ==  
 Thommas was a pioneer of the study of marine mollusks and studied them under highly prestigious institutional funding. He also published important publications on many aspects of molluscan anatomy, development and morphology, and on embryology and specialised in comparative anatomy.He was particularly interested in the morphological groups that often fall under zoological study, such as roundworms and millipedes, which often have specialized shells ; Mollusca in general, but especially Montiprus magnificus and their zoology counterparts ; and had the interesting prehistory of the highly hypogeous fish we have today. He was also able to describe on anatomical and developmental level many other molluscs in general, such as the delicate velvet worm, the specks made up of pinworm `` squirts '' and capillaries in which the glands of melanin.

 == Biography ==  
 Born in Giovanoni, it was during World War I when Daniele joined the La Sapienza Zoo. After completing his zoology studies he was asked to become an assistant to the Zoologist of the laboratory. He was hired for the office by the zoological laboratory in 1924. He studied birds, working with dr. Peter Lepsius, then led to researches on reptiles and birds.  
 In the last year of his life he had a great desire to become an ornithologist, hoping to discover new species, `` those that are unappreciated in the ornithological world ''.  
 Daniele continued his research, obtaining important evidence of the distribution of European birds, and also completed a work that helped establish the place of Crustacea. A recent identification of the male forms of the Crustacea was done with Daniele. This discovery was accepted by the National Museum of Natural History in 1925.  
 Daniele continued to work on the supply of the Neustadt Veterinary Laboratory, first as an assistant, then as Director, appointed in 1950. This position he held until his death in 1983.

Joseph William Bassan ( 27 July 1829 – 29 March 1897 ) was a Jamaican physician and botanist.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Bassan was born at Daventry. He was the son of Rev. John Bassan and Charlotte Battan. He was educated at St Francis's School, Strand. In 1874, he entered the Natural History Department of the City College of New York, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1878.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Bassan studied medicine at the Zoological Institute of London. In 1886 he went to Germany, settling in Munich. In 1887, he married Elizabeth Edward Hope of Runcorn ; and they had four children : Amelia Bassan ( 1891–1914 ), David Battan ( 1892–1965 ), Lorraine Bassan ( 1896–1936 ), and Walter Bassan ( 1901–1963 ). During his short visit, Bassan discovered several rare plants that are still in common use, for example, the rubble crab Melaleuca paradisi.  
 On the outbreak of war between Germany and France in 1894, he and two members of his family moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, where he was rector of the local Normal School for the Blind. In 1900, he and his wife had one child, Marion. Bassan died on 29 March 1897 in Manhattan.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 One of the most important research botanists in the world at the turn of the century, Bassan produced a long list of over 40 taxa of fungi. He also introduced the first genera of the red lanternspotted plants, Fatula ( 1905 ), Jullia ( 1911 ), Luminae ( 1920 ), and Tonaria ( 1922 ). He authored ( with Arthur N. Greenberg ) the `` Flora New York '' series ( 1923 ). Bassan received the National Medal of Science in 1922, and his name appears on two United States postage stamps. In 1928, he was the subject of a new biography, `` The Father of Botany in Jamaica '', by Jessie Shively. Dr. Joseph Bassan was the first living descendant of the Josiah Bassan family, who were the first non-English speakers in Jamaica.In 1937, Dr. Joseph Bassan was invited to enter the prestigious Botany Hall of Fame of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, a post he held for several years.

 = James Balfour =  
James Balfour ( 7 September 1861 – 20 October 1928 ) was an English psychologist and sociologist. He was Professor of Psychology at Cambridge University and Theological Lecturer in 1927. He was author of a famous and influential book, A Factor of Evolution.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Balfour was born on 7 September 1861 at the parish of St Gregory's, Braintree, the son of Daniel Philip Balfour and Elizabeth Solly. His family were from the Lowland Isles in south-eastern England where his father was a priest. His paternal grandfather was the churchwarden of Port Barrow in Kent and a younger sister, Eliza Ethel Balfour. Balfour was educated at the local school and the university. He won a scholarship and attended Trinity College, Cambridge University for two years ( 1862–1863 ) where he became interested in mathematics.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Balfour initially taught as a lecturer at the college in which he was a fellow of Trinity, and at many schools and colleges, such as York and Linlithgow. His first post was as demonstrator in political science at the Royal Naval Academy in Bristol ( 1863–1866 ). The government thought that the man who could teach mechanics was inferior to the man who could teach philosophy, and in this way Balfour was deprived of a post in physics. Balfour was able to earn a university commission at the start of 1868 when he was awarded a scholarship to teach practical natural science and philosophy to the Royal Naval Academy in London, lecturing on subjects such as hydraulics, mechanics, geology, astronomy, mining, and other related subjects. His trip to Europe helped him advance his mathematical education and gained him an early reputation as an unusually good teacher. Balfour was not, however, appointed Assistant of the Philosophical Department but rather Lecturer in Philosophy ; this would prove a great career advancement, and he became Professor of Philosophy and Art in 1881. This position ( which he held until he retired in 1929 ) was largely due to the pioneering work of Joseph Schur. Balfour's students included Arthur Lyttelton and Sir James George Frazer.

 == Biography ==  
 Pavel Samuelovich Bagarin was born at Kursk, Russian Empire. He began his violin studies in Vienna, where he was a member of the Vienna Philharmonic Society and Leningrad Philharmonic Society. In 1903, he entered the Petersburg Conservatory and performed his first concert in 1901. In 1901, he took the class of the faculty of teaching, and he remained there for 10 years. In 1907, he became a conductor of the St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, from 1910 to 1923, when he became principal conductor of the Teatro d'Orfeo Nazionale Piazmesi in Rome. The following year he became professor of music theory, and for a period of time he was the head of the department of musical theory of the Prague Conservatory.  
   
   
 == Selected works ==  
 Bagarin's repertoire includes a large number of compositions, most of them available to the public. According to the Statistical Abstract of the Russian National Library of Music and Musicians of the USSR, he is regarded by the public as the most important violinist of the 20th century, and his 20 concerts in Moscow alone were performed in more than 14 thousand concert halls and festivals. Bagarin is the violinist who appears in Rimsky-Korsakov's complete Symphony No. 2 in D minor in 1909 and in the premiere version of Schubert's Petrouchka, Op. 7, in the USSR. According to Artur Bialik, Bagarin performed the violin part in Schubert's highly acclaimed second quintet Op. 4 ( premiered in 1905 ) and the real-life Schubert's violin sonata in D minor at the opera scene in Zürich and at the Kommunikation under Max Weber in Berlin in 1919. Bagarin was a contributor to Berlioz's opera Die Meistersinger in 1906, and he played the violin part in Rodionovich Dolder's opera The Hoops of Love in 1926. During World War I, Bagarin played the violin part in the Austrian concerto Viennese Hymn ( until 1919 ), under Wladimir Balfour and Emil Germer.Bagarin also made contributions to Nikolai Rubinstein's Der Eucharist and Die Rassenkonzentrationschule ( published from 1903 to 1908 ).

 Barletsov was the son of Archimandrite Robert Alexandrovich Barletsov and his wife Maria Alexandrovna ( née Morsov ). His parents were parish priest Semyon Alexandrovich Barletov and his wife Anastasia Vasilievna Barletov. From 1848 to 1856, Barletsov studied philosophy in Tiflis, and at the Lyceum of Theotokos he had a close friendship with Georg Simpavia.  
 He was sent to Vrba to study philosophy in 1857, but left the study after nine years, presumably due to the religious persecution under the tsar. At age 31, he returned to Moscow and began teaching philosophy at the Tsar's Courses.

 = Alexander Griffiths (musician) =  
Alexander Griffiths ( November 8, 1911 – February 14, 1987 ) was an American pianist, music educator and administrator. Griffiths was a distinguished teacher at the Mondavi School of Music in Jerusalem and toured in Europe and North America, and helped establish many American recording and radio stations.Griffiths earned a degree from the Rochester Institute of Technology, earning his Haverford College Music Licensure in 1932. Griffiths taught at Mondavi School for almost thirty years, retiring in 1984. He also taught at ROTC's Northwestern University, from 1945 to 1949 and from 1949 to 1957. During this time he made an incursion into the international career scene in Los Angeles, where he founded and directed the Los Angeles Music School.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Griffiths was born in a music family and went to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1921. Griffiths studied piano and composition with Eno Van Itterschoot in Budapest and at the Amsterdam Conservatory, where he was named head of a large piano orchestra. He also taught at Mount Holyoke College and at the Juilliard School.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1935, Griffiths founded the Mondavi School of Music in Jerusalem, where he taught privately for more than ten years. The school merged into Mondavi College in 1949, and he went on to be a member of the board of directors. Griffiths was a leader in teaching American piano at the Mondavi School, having taught every key major and minor key, both physical and technical. His most notable student was Glenn Miller, who became a central figure in the history of American recording music, and is credited with sparking the birth of modern American recording, the movement that ultimately led to the rapid popularity of classical and jazz music.  
 In 1940, the Mondavi School moved to Israel, and Griffiths took up an teaching position at the Lehigh School of Music. In 1957 he became the director of the Mondavi College Center for Teaching and Research, an institution that had been established in 1961 by Robert Kennedy and Stanley Herzog. A major of the combined Mondavi Center, a performance space in Jerusalem's Old City, Griffiths was able to relocate and move his studio there in 1967, when his graduate students, starting with Eli Garrod and Irving Tenenbaum, began to work in a new school.  
 Griffiths founded the jazz label The J.C. Haas Music Company and took a leading role in the RCA Victor label. He had also founded and run the first jazz music school in the country in Israel. Griffiths developed a school system of less government involvement and more individual initiative, which ultimately became a significant part of the experience for young musicians.  
 Griffiths earned two Grammy awards for the piano duet `` Black Bear '' in 1959 and 1969. He continued to work in Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, and returned to the U.S. in 1971. Griffiths also served as chairman of the Berlin Philharmonic from 1968 to 1970 and as executive vice president in the 1980s and '90s of the New York Philharmonic. Griffiths was elected to the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1975.  
 He died in Jerusalem of cancer in 1987.

 = Francesco Bienielli =  
Francesco Bienielli ( 2 April 1813 – 17 July 1888 ) was an Italian mathematician and one of the most celebrated mathematicians of the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Francesco Bienielli was born in Genoa, Italy and studied mathematics at the Lycée in Parma. He later enrolled in the University of Padua, and there learned physics and Latin. He attended the United States Naval Academy ( 1862–1867 ) where he studied mathematics under the guidance of Louis Davison, finishing the school year with a Ph.D. under Bostrom.In 1868, at the age of twenty-nine, Bienielli wrote his first work, First Data of the Cosmological Principle in conjunction with Salvatore Filippelli ( his doctoral student ). In the same year he published his second book, Cosmological Particles, in the Astrological Journal and also made an astronomical discovery. This resulted in his being offered the university position of Professor of Mathematical physics at Pisa in 1869. At that time there were no facilities in Pisa for experimental physicists.Bienielli obtained his appointment in 1871, and he in 1874 published his first article on the motion of spherical torus around the sun, taking its plane. After years of extensive scientific work, including the motion of the Earth around the sun, he submitted his book to L'Académie des sciences mathématiques in 1879. He made the first attempt at describing all possible Maxwellian plates. In 1881, Bienielli's The Concept of Volume was published. Bienielli demonstrated that the elliptic class of particles consists of Maxwellian plate layers, one for each charge-energy function, which was later recognized by contemporary biophysicists, as an area of interest in relativity. Bienielli was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Naples in 1884. In the same year he married Maria Rosa di Milano ( 1851–1874 ) and they had a son and a daughter. In the same year, he also published his most important paper, `` On the Sun ''. By 1886, he had begun to publish various books and papers, mostly on the history of mathematics. Among his more famous publications were the Elements of Newtonian Mechanics ( 1883 ) and Mechanics of the Earth ( 1893 ). Bienielli died in Naples in 1888 and was buried in Naples Cemetery.

 John A. Fries =  
John A. Fries ( March 28, 1927 – July 20, 1998 ) was an American industrial chemist and bacteriologist. He was instrumental in the research of an easily isolated zinc deficiency in cereal plants.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 John Albert Fries was born on March 28, 1927 in Wisconsin. His father died when he was two years old. He attended a Lutheran school in Plainfield, Minnesota. When Fries was in middle school he developed an allergy to peanuts. By the time he reached high school he was allergic to many of the same foods. He left school at 18 and entered the University of Wisconsin as a Biochemistry major, where he studied Chemical Engineering.He received his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1954 under the supervision of Robert L. Burt.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Disorders ===  
 In 1962, John Albert Fries was appointed the founding Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Disorders at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). This position had previously been held by Henry J. Hugan.Fries was assigned by NIH as a Research Scientist to gather evidence of a deficiency of zinc in cereals. During this research, Fries discovered a zinc deficiency in wheat. There was no known mechanism to explain why the deficiency occurred in specific cereal crops. Using analysis of the intestinal microbes of wheat and potato, Fries was able to determine that zinc deficiency was due to dietary zinc deficiency. Fries was able to isolate the single yellow phenylalanine he found in yellow bread in yellow mold ; this was the first zinc-containing food. His wheat-yellow mold study proved to be an important contribution to the understanding of the function of zinc in proteins and vitamin B12.  
   
   
 === Health physicist ===  
 In the early 1970s, Fries became director of the National Institute of Allergy, Infectious Diseases, and Immunology ( NIID ), where he headed the Center for Excellence in Life Sciences at the NIH. From 1980 to 1989, he served on the editorial board of the leading life science journal, Science.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 The principal object of his work was the pathophysiology of pathologic conditions related to normal physiological processes, and the determination of viable candidate proteins in disorders. In 1960, Fries married Mary Elizabeth Kate Olsen, an expert nutritionist and author, with whom he had two daughters. He died on July 20, 1998 in Tuskegee, Alabama at the age of 71. Fries was also a physicist. He invented a procedure called the hotplate centrifuge that allowed the production of large amounts of DNA from non-living living organisms. He had served on an advisory committee to the American Chemical Society from 1967 to 1974.

Frances Mackenzie, sometimes called Frances McGinty, was an Irish woman born in Cork, Ireland, the daughter of Almon Mackenzie and Mary Frances ( Morley ) McGinty. Her father was a tradesman. She also had an older brother and sister.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 McGinty was born on 14 March 1884 in Cork, Ireland, the daughter of Almon Mackenzie and Mary Frances ( Morley ) McGinty. Her father was a mancher at the Dublin Fish and Game Company, and on his death remarried Frances'mother. McGinty was the youngest of six daughters and granddaughters of the Mackenzie family. They all were educated at the Royal Dublin Academy and St. Columba's High School, Cork, graduating in 1897.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 McGinty was working in the grain-dealers office in Cork from 1907 to 1914. She was particularly interested in carpentry and embroidery. After taking leave of absence in 1914, she completed a degree in applied mechanics at the Royal Dublin Academy in 1916. She then returned to the Fisheries Department, serving as a market agent. She returned to the Academy as a sub-agent for its branch office in Dublin, and went on to graduate from University College Cork in 1922.  
 After working for the Fisheries Department, she returned to Dublin as a market agent, eventually becoming an assistant to Dr. James Connolly, a chemist in the Department of Fisheries.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 In December 1936 she married John MacDougall, a businessman who had worked for her father-in-law. Her health deteriorated as she worked at the market in Cork, and she was required to sleep on the street on a daily basis. She eventually came to the conclusion that she would rather work on top of the boy, on the open blue herring farm near the Royal Dublin Academy. However, this view was countered by her husband, who wanted to farm a little distance from the Academy, for his business in Cork. She gave him a steady stream of fish, returning to the Academy in time to see it opened up in December 1939.Frances'husband died in 1942, when she was 19 years old, and she moved in with her mother in Cork. They had two daughters and a son.  
 In 1950, she married senior clergyman Richard L'Estrange, and they had a son, John, who became a United Nations representative, an architect and, subsequently, a Unesco official.

He then worked at the University of St. Petersburg and earned his habilitation in theology in 1914. He went to the seminary of the Russian Church in Tartu, which opened in 1920.At Tartu he continued his religious studies and received his doctorate in 1923. During the first session of the Moscow Soviet, he was head of the intellectual team responsible for the performance of a public interview. Afterwards he studied theology at the Leningrad Univesity, later at St. Petersburg Theological College ( 1929 ). After returning to Tartu in 1941, he became professor of theology there. From 1954 he was the vicar general of Tartu.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 On the Soviet Writers ’ Plebiscites and the Glory to God : A Project, by Father Kamen Svetloch in the journal Slavoj Kot, Yerofeyev stated that :  
   
 I have been his godfather and companion... My love for Saint Vladimir and his saints is so profound that I can hardly show affection for them. This will not prevent me being able to, and will give me strength to carry out this great undertaking... I believe it to be God's will. It is not always easy to believe in such a drastic and transparent way that I could do it. But I thank you because I am not alone ; I am with you.  
 In his autobiographical work, Orthodox Churchyard ( in Russian ), he states : `` It was difficult to believe that the destiny of the Fatherland depended on his direct encouragement and aid. Our motherland has been robbed, defeated, humiliated, and exploited by Christendom. I was denied the prelates of Pontifical Biblical Institute, which seems to have become a collection of women's magazines, but Saint Vladimir encouraged me to continue my studies, and prayed with me every day. He has always loved me. In the name of Father Sergey Yerofeyev, I dedicate a prayer for us Orthodox ''.

Vito Sallie ( 15 January 1844 – 21 March 1941 ) was an Italian zoologist.  
 In 1892, Sallie moved to the United States in order to do fieldwork. The general public was at a loss how to explain the appearance of Sallie's cattle, despite his previous documentation of them. In 1901, Sallie described the white-throated trilobite for the first time, however because of technical difficulties he was unable to publish the research in its entirety. In 1920, Sallie and two other `` reliable '' zoologists, Edward Plass, played the part of ophthalmologists in reviewing and feeding the species of mako ( Araneus maculatus ), which had previously been seen in photographs taken in a Japanese expedition. The discovery of mako consumption by humans would eventually be documented by this `` reliable '' group of scientists, where Sallie became the `` primary contributor '' to understanding the South Pacific's biological and economical problems.Sallie was President of the American Museum of Natural History from 1893 to 1897. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as of the Southwestern Biology Association, and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was awarded the First Class Scientific Merit of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1903.Sallie also participated in negotiations with the United States Navy in 1916 and 1918 to introduce naval ships into a New Zealand Antarctic expedition for a scientific trial, which was to provide a platform for Franklin Delano Roosevelt to make a public statement, which could have predicted the worst in subsequent years as well.Because of his research, Sallie was nominated for membership on the Academy's Hall of Fame in 1921, as well as a Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

 = Denis Maleev =  
Denis Nikolayevich Maleev ( Russian : Пригельевич Миха́льев ; 11 June 1922 – 23 April 1983 ) was a Soviet industrial designer. He was the founder of his country's first in-house e-commerce platform. He was also involved in developing many technologies related to e-commerce such as e-commerce design.The Geely e-commerce platform was founded in 1985 and, over time, its capabilities have been expanded to include more products. The operating group began the social network site `` Lifestyle '' in 1993, which since 2008 has gone by the name of `` Lifestyleev ''. The Lifestyle group is `` open '', therefore users can create and interact with their profiles, contacts and important political and business figures, as well as others, through social networks.  
 He was a professor at the Aeronautics and Astronautics Institute ( Aviation Engineering Institute ) of the National Academy of Engineering and a member of numerous scientific and industry bodies, among them, the Institute of Aviation Engineering of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 Born in the Novodevichy Province, he attended high school in the city of St. Petersburg and graduated in 1927. At that time, he worked for an amateur trade group in his native city of Novodevichy, a subsidiary of Aeroflot. In 1932, at the age of 20, he began his career as a designer.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 With a mechanical and material science background, Maleev taught himself everything he could about designs. His first invention was a lifting seat that he titled `` Lifting seat ''. In 1948 he invented the ‘ gas-powered lifting seat, ’ and the post-war Russian newspaper Diptek, ’ published an account of it.  
 After the USSR became communist, Maleev became the head of the design group at Yuzhno-Novodevichy Ltd. ( today Y. Uzel ). Maleev and his friends tested the design on the railway line, the Dnipropetrovsk-3 ( Dnipro ) line, between St. Petersburg and Sochi. It introduced advanced steps such as automatic seat selection and reclining.  
 Maleev's experimental design, introduced in 1951, proved that if the seats are lifted on their respective segments and not one piece, it becomes possible to allow occupants to move from one seat to the next with ease. He also invented the ‘ Flight-Brake ’ for automatic forward and backward horizontal adjustments. Maleev and his associates made significant improvements to the lift system, and between 1952 and 1959 nearly $ 12 billion in sales were realized on Lifts-Centrice. Maleev was twice elected a Soviet state scientist.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Femaleev was not only the creator of an innovative and competitive e-commerce industry, but also a pioneering social scientist. He was deeply involved in development of communications technology for the e-commerce industry. He is also known for work related to the problem of traffic congestion in urban areas, in addition to invention and invention related to issues of rural economic development, and the creation of information technology and the Internet. His inventions also brought him respect from the Russian public.In 1990 Maleev received the Lenin Prize. It is awarded `` for individual merits with a philosophical character and long-lasting and enduring value to the world, '' as stated by the design group at the World Cultural and Scientific Center, Moscow.

 = Harold Klehr =  
Harold Elvin `` Harro '' Klehr ( November 16, 1919 – November 22, 2002 ) was an American microbiologist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Harold Klehr was born in Portland, Oregon, on November 16, 1919. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1940 from the University of Oregon, where he was supervised by Eric Jordan. At Oregon, he was associated with the Oregon Biological Research Laboratory ( APL ), the only laboratory open to undergraduates and where he received his PhD in 1942. His Ph.D. thesis explored the structure of bacteria, which led him to become interested in cytology, the study of living cells, under Prof. Robert Scheer at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. In 1945, he accepted an appointment as assistant professor of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he remained until 1956, and then associate professor of microbiology until he became professor emeritus in 1969. In 1953, he retired as a professor emeritus and returned to teaching at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He was made professor emeritus in 1967, but he died of stomach cancer in 2002.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
   
 He discovered that Streptococcus pneumoniae lives in the cell wall of the human fetus. The scientific name of the organism is Strep-Pneumoniae, after his birthplace and his laboratory, in Portland, Oregon. In an effort to illustrate his observations in a quantitative manner, he called the organism a bacteria. Klehr later spent more than half a century trying to understand this compound organism and how it might work. In the early days of his career, Klehr studied hemolytic uremic syndrome, which he thought was caused by a virus, but later concluded it was caused by a protease enzyme, a biological material that by now is commonly believed to be involved in the generation of and maintenance of protein fibrils. Klehr's experiments also demonstrated that microorganisms break down proteins involved in cell wall development in vitro, in the presence of other proteins such as tyrosine and uridine.  
   
 The enzyme Klehr created in his lab is called Klehr's kinase, for short. Klehr later invented his kinase as a new treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes. It was later proven that these particles, known as transporters, are produced by Klehr's kinase in response to amino acids in the blood, serving as the bioelectric system for the disease. It is unknown if these particles act as a signal for other cells to activate the protein fibrils needed to maintain cells in their normal state.  
 Klehr discovered that, like living cells, the inorganic structures of bacteria incorporate properties of the organic substances they are made of. An example is his experimental demonstration of the point, the organelle that separates sperm from egg cells, which appears as two rows of bioluminescent protoplasm that separate the two.Because he and his colleague Paul R. Schmitt named bacteria after Klehr and Scheer, the bacterium Klehrostoma is named after him in reference to his discovery.  
   
   
 == Collaboration ==  
 Klehr's most prominent student was developmental biologist Oliver Sacks, Jr., a co-author of The Neutron Enzymology of the Worm. Klehr's laboratory was later established at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Columbia University Medical Center.

 = Igor Fonberg =  
Igor Fonberg ( 28 May 1904 – 27 March 1972 ) was a Soviet and Soviet-American astrophysicist. He was a member of the faculty of the Lomonosov Moscow State University from 1953–1970.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Fonberg was born in Teplice, Voronezh Oblast, Russia. In his early years he took a prestigious course in the subjects of chemistry, physics and astronomy at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. In 1943 he graduated as an international master of science in Soviet mathematics and astronomy. He then took a place as an assistant at the Lyman Beale Observatory in New Mexico, and during World War II his laboratory at Lomonosov Moscow State University began to produce Soviet astronomy equipment. After the armistice he and Boris Padral were among the first group of personnel working on Soviet magnetic instrumentation.In 1946, Fonberg was sent to the United States and worked as an assistant at the United States National Bureau of Standards in Pullman, Washington. He joined the Soviet Astronomical Institute of Experimental Physics in 1948 as an assistant in the laboratory of Semyon Blizhnyak. The following year, he was promoted to associate in the scientific staff at the Lowell Observatory. In 1953 he became an instructor in the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics in the USSR Academy of Sciences. There he was responsible for the development of their Russian Magnetic Observatory. In 1958 he became an advisor in the theoretical department at the Space Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, from which he was given an honorary doctorate by the university. In 1968, he was the head of the research institute's chemical field group. In the course of his 30-year career he co-authored more than 2,000 scientific articles, the majority of them published in scientific journals.  
   
   
 == Research group ==  
 The group focused on research of the slow oscillations and refractive indices of molecular systems and some problems in theoretical physics. Fonberg joined the research group in 1950. Within the group his development focused on the speed and the phenomena of solar radiation, variable refraction and scattering of high-energy electrons, the mechanics of the solar corona and ionization of the solar cells and energetic cosmic rays. Other areas of focus included the overall structure of cosmic rays, particles in interstellar space, and quantum physics.Fonberg organized seminars in natural science research ; photometry, the theory of polarization, and the theory of ionization of gases. He published book reviews, monographs, and articles. In 1956 he received a Fellowship from the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. Fonberg retired in 1969 and was appointed an administrator of the Experimental Physics Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  
   
   
 == Teaching and collaboration ==  
 A noted teacher, Fonberg was considered a prominent researcher and a colleague. With his voluminous output he was able to combine breadth of knowledge with an essential ability to apply this knowledge in a very short period of time. He was able to show that very short pulses of radio-frequency energy can produce ionization of the gas atoms, and that in superposed states of quasi-random and different-shaped gas atoms, the expected behavior of this phenomenon is apparent. This highly original research was appreciated by students and their colleagues in different research groups, and in the field of classical physics and astronomy. He also was a committed and highly productive collaborator, which led to many students having an influence on his own research efforts.  
 He was one of the most noted and accessible scientists in the theoretical physics department. In 1958 he received the prestigious Lev Nedelman Prize and was elected to the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1973 the Academy of Sciences honoured him with the `` Doctor of the USSR '' ( USSR : Professorialoita sovietskikh ionomeni ).

 = Jaap Neuer =  
Jaap Neuer ( July 20, 1893 – June 30, 1988 ) was a Dutch psychiatrist and writer. He studied in Belgium, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. Neuer is best known for his works on humanistic psychology, and for his contributions to children's literature.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Neuer studied at the Universities of Leiden, Halle, Leiden, Heidelberg, Amsterdam, and Heidelberg, earning a doctoral degree in 1918. He joined the psychiatric profession at the age of 28, whereupon he became a lecturer at the University of Leiden, serving there from 1921 to 1924 and 1918 to 1923. In 1928 he moved to the University of Amsterdam, and returned to Leiden in 1935 as the professor of psychology at the newly established The Hague Institute.  
 Neuer was an early proponent of psychiatric treatment as a means of easing the sufferings of socially distressed individuals. As a result of his work in the field of psychology and the treatment of children, he was elected to the Second Hague Literary and Philosophical Society in 1942. In 1966 he was awarded the Prix Pierre Emmanuel Laurene and a National Prize in Literature and Poetry for his book, Kortus de Action ( `` Krampmunch Het Fil Tijd of Daar '', translated into English as Why Children Struggle and the Fatherless Child. ) ( Carl M. Zeiss ), which argued that both intellectually and morally development is an internal condition of an individual ( later adapted into `` neurosis '', in the phrase coined by his colleague William Ward Pearson ).The pediatrician and child psychiatrist Pierre Jean Nouvelle once described Neuer as a `` man of sound beliefs and sound philosophy ''.

 = William F. Agnew =  
William F. Agnew ( June 20, 1876 – April 1, 1935 ) was an American pharmacologist and bacteriologist, whose early career as an administrator at Imperial Chemical Industries and major roles in the development of penicillin may have set the stage for the development of antibiotic drugs.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Agnew was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of James and Catharine Agnew. He attended the Victor Lincoln High School of Woodbridge, Vermont. He received his B.S. degree in medicine from Harvard in 1895 and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1902.  
   
   
 == Scientific career ==  
 He became a major member of the government's Chemical Laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, and a leading purveyor of penicillin, as early as 1897. In 1900 he received a federal appointment as Assistant Under Secretary of the Interior in charge of the Bureau of Standards, which gave him direct control over all federal research. This was particularly important in coordination with the government's Chemical Research Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory, where Agnew was the first to synthesize penicillin. In 1903 he was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He became a professor of medicine at Harvard University in 1905, and went on to lead a large pharmaceutical firm until his death.  
   
   
 == Activism for antibiotic therapy ==  
 In 1894, Agnew and his colleague Joseph A. Rosamilia realized that penicillin was as good a prophylactic vaccine as could be developed. In an 1897 paper, they published that an antibiotic working as well as anti-bacterial would kill 120 times as many germs as a standard penicillin formulation. This was greatly aided by the discovery of diphtheria toxin, in which penicillin contained 5 parts of the toxin, while the standard penicillin contained around 2 parts. Agnew called for penicillin producers to be better prepared to develop new antibiotics, both for their own use and to research which antibiotics would be effective in higher cases. Because penicillin was not available to the US at the time, these calls led to Agnew and his associates being able to quickly produce their purified penicillin. Though the published paper was controversial, it became the first documented example of penicillin being given a popular prescription.When Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, Agnew joined with other major penicillin manufacturers in urging FDR to abolish the Division of Soils, a division that involved natural resources and imported chemicals. Agnew was concerned that this would have a very negative effect on the viability of the industry, as minerals and certain foreign chemicals were considered vital to the production and use of penicillin. Further, by removing pressure from the government, control of penicillin would have become more tightly controlled and would have left the industry with no option but to continue to provide inexpensive injections. Agnew was a strong advocate of the National Government League ( NGL ), a movement led by the World Anti-Fascist League ( WWA ), which opposed the Nazi takeover of Germany and argued that, if the Nazis did manage to take over Germany, it would make the new government effective at preserving the Jewish people, and should leave the United States free and open to global cooperation. Agnew and his NGL were appointed to a House committee in 1934, but their influence was limited as anti-Nazi forces dominated public opinion.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 Agnew died at the age of 81 in 1937.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Agnew was the son of James and Catharine Agnew, and he married Mary Maud Ocher and had two daughters, Margaret ( born 1904 ) and Deborah ( born 1906 ). Agnew had three sons, Frank Agnew and William Walter Agnew, two brothers, Herbert A. and James Brian, and a sister, Ann.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Agnew's papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine in the United States Library System at Albany, New York.

 = Robert Hayne =  
Robert Hayne ( 17 May 1883, in London – 16 January 1973 ) was a British archaeologist who led excavations of palaeolithic sites in Yorkshire for over 20 years. He is credited with elucidating the relationship between these areas and the later Neolithic. He is best known for his successful excavations of nearby Wybarr Stone in the Yorkshire Channel.  
 Hayne was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and then spent some time at Calcutta Normal School before beginning his career. In 1898, he took part in the construction of the Bailey School, and his practical teaching of geology helped forge a lasting friendship with the school's headmaster, James Ritchie.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1906, Hayne joined the Yorkshire Institute of Archaeology as a research assistant and was given a ten-month leave of absence to build the Bailey School ( now the Edward Archer School ). By 1913, he and Ritchie were both forced to resign from their posts over anti-social behaviour in the school.  
 Hayne's later excavations, however, were never wholly successful. In 1922–1923, he led the excavations at Shropshire, Meath and Shrewsbury where he continued to lead important excavations, which included several sites important to science. These included the first known ( at that time ) effigy of a Homo erectus from the prehistoric period, the first known human presence on a homogenous village, and a village cart and altar found in northern Shropshire. These discoveries allowed Hayne to believe that the site had once been used by nomadic hunter-gatherers as a prosperous trading town. This work, and Hayne's attempts to rebut the prevailing theory of the Stone Age, led to him being appointed a palaeolithic archaeologist to the British Museum in 1923, and he wrote the monograph Eruption of the Shropshire Site : The Shropshire Site, First appearing in 1937.In 1922–1925, Hayne led the excavation at Redhill, Kendal, near Leeds, where he named a suite of Neolithic rock types known as vesiculites ( that was the name by which they are usually known today ), the first species of rock and stone whose name had been established in English by William Wilson in 1905. Following the excavation of the city, he conducted further excavations at Leicester and Leicester's bay, further sequences at Wakefield, Sunderland, Shrewsbury, Wigglesworth and Bridgewater. He also led excavations at Guernsey, which opened in 1930.  
   
   
 == Other interests ==  
 In the 1920s, Hayne also wrote a series of popular and popular books and articles about archaeology and human history. He was a co-founder of the British Folklore Society and chaired its council for the next 27 years. He was a senior lecturer at Cambridge and was its vice-president from 1937 until 1951. He was also a co-founder and university organiser of the Archeological Society, and its president from 1959 until 1961. He received a knighthood from the Queen for his services to archaeology in the 1930s and the Procurator General of the British Museum, for services to archaeology during World War II.Hayne and Ritchie formed a close and lasting friendship, lasting until his death, during which time he encouraged Ritchie to publish his papers on the Stone Age, until Ritchie wrote them. Although Hayne enjoyed the company of many archaeologists, he was not granted permission to associate with any one particular person.

 = Daniel N. Jensen =  
Daniel Nehemiah Jensen ( November 23, 1863 – December 8, 1938 ) was an American metallurgist and engineer. He was noted for his work in refining galvanic and epithermal materials. He is best known for the concept of what he called `` magnetic coating '' which is a structural process whereby metal is coated with a molecular composition or layers of tiny electrons. This technique has been used to improve an engineer's ability to operate a machine or process and provide for high quality control.Jensen was born on November 23, 1863 in Denver, Colorado. His parents were Zora N. Jensen, a pioneer in bird breeding, and James Ronald Jensen, a pioneer in forest forestry. Daniel Jensen attended Rocky Mountain High School and attended the University of Denver College. Jensen completed a doctoral degree in chemistry and mechanical engineering from the University of Chicago in 1876.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Education and career ===  
 Jensen was a charter member of the Yale Football Club, which became the professional football team of the University of Colorado. In 1879, Jensen was appointed professor of metallurgy and metallurgy at the University of Denver. Jensen was a pioneer in the use of epithermal compounds to enhance steel corrosion resistance and also applied for patent 7,193,527 `` Magnetic Covering of Steel ''. This was the first patent granted to the U.S. in 1901.  
   
   
 === Discovery of magnetic coating ===  
 Jensen was also active as a long-distance runner and was known for his intense running regimen. He embarked on a seven-week road trip from Denver to San Francisco in May, 1882 and covered 120 miles in seven days. Jensen noticed that during his 60-mile trek he lost 10 pounds. Jensen spent over six months recording his findings using several logbooks, nearly doubling the number of hours of exertion at his disposal, and being advised by the scientific community to study this discovery closely. His work is now known to be the very first scientific research to explore the phenomenon of microspikes on solids, cement and ice. With the authority of his patents, Jensen and Henry Ramsay began the first research involving a microspike problem.  
   
   
 === More exciting discoveries ===  
 His contemporaries noticed Jensen's creative talent. The Boulder Herald-Journal wrote about `` the accidental discovery of a newly developed application of improved technique,'magnetic coating, '' stating that :  
   
 What gives Jensen special effect when applied to steel and other soft and brittle materials is his astuteness in using metallic and chemical barriers. These qualities and more are the result of a series of experiments on melted metals, cement and calcite. '' Jensen added that his discoveries would now `` explain the deposition of microspikes in automobile brakes, bridges and automobiles ''.  
   
   
 == Longevity ==  
 His preferred term to describe his innovative work is `` dazzling '', and was used by James Ramsay in a well-known quote : `` The clever old man says that God is everywhere, and I can only say that I believe him. `` Jensen was employed by the University of Colorado, one of the largest universities in the United States, for the duration of his career and was awarded 28 patents for his research and other contributions to industrial matters.Jensen married Augusta Ellen Stinchfield ( 1873–1949 ) in 1889, and had two children, Henry ( 1898–1973 ), who would become a distinguished U.S. Army colonel, and Elizabeth Ann ( 1903–1998 ). He died in Boulder on December 8, 1938, after a long illness.

 = Emile Chabrier =  
Emile Chabrier ( 2 April 1899 – 27 March 1973 ) was a French writer. His first novel, Les fils chapelles ( The Filthy Workmen ), was first published in 1923, and was followed in 1926 by the poem The Times of Helen ( Love the Voice ), which became a book in French. In 1929 he wrote Les Princes de l'Homme. The Song of the Proletariat ( 1928 ) and American Golden Wire ( 1930 ) were great hits in the United States, and Chabrier had begun publishing in Canada in 1931. Chabrier died in 1973 in Gaspé-et-Marne, where he had lived since 1924.  
 Chabrier wrote fiction in both literary form and popular expression. Although Chabrier regarded himself as a writer, he was not a strictly literary person, as he professed a hatred of them. While he had few literary friends, he did have excellent friends, with whom he continued to write. Chabrier's writing for this art sometimes struck a chord with readers of the various publications that he had published over the years. The positive reviews of Les fils chapelles were certainly part of this.  
 Chabrier was the son of a merchant family of smallpox survivors, the grandson of Captain Jean Lavergne ( 1882-1969 ) of the sea service, and nephew of Charles Lucien Chabrier. His family was `` middle class '' in a fashion that changed over his career, but in the general métier of his family and friends his father and grandfather had both been distinguished poets and writers. Chabrier's life was devoted to resistance, if such a thing could be called it ; he decided against the career path of the `` proletarian '' of France, the `` young officer,, without capital. '' However, `` he could not remain behind his wife and two children at home. '' Following the widespread introduction of automatic weapons and the arrival of airplanes at his grandparents'house in the 1880s, he dropped the army as he came of age. In 1930 he moved to his maternal grandfather's house, which still stood in the village of Racine. This influenced his later novels. The Chabriers were nonconformist Huguenots, and Chabrier was always pro-German.  
 Chabrier's autobiographical novel, In Search of God, gives a portrait of 18th-century Puritan society, of a grand-father with ambitious ambition, and of his son, Philippe, the rascal who scatters Champignons among the disaffected by jumping out of a window while drunk and winds up with his trousers pulled back on a second time. After returning to society, Chabrier again resolves to write novels : only for money! His first couple of novels, in 1930 and 1937, were widely reprinted, making them a bestseller.Chabrier produced the works from his mid-nineties, e.g. 1957, which drew large-scale crowds at cons, became a novella, many a lengthy fanfic, the opera Les Princes de l'Homme ( 1830–1853 ), and the first volumes of his popular short story collection Les Princes d'amour ( 1938 ).

Antonio C. Del Russo ( or Del Russo ) ( 1898–1967 ) was a Puerto Rican intellectual known for his work in advanced liberal studies and postcolonial history.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Del Russo was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on January 18, 1898, the son of Antonio Salvatore Del Russo ( 1869–1930 ), a public servant. After graduating from the University of Puerto Rico in 1907, he earned a master's degree from Fordham University. For his dissertation on colonial economics in Puerto Rico, he received a thesis on `` The Will to Power in Colonial Puerto Rico ''. Del Russo taught at various universities in Puerto Rico for many years, eventually ending his academic career in 1947.  
   
   
 === Birth and death ===  
 Del Russo grew up in a middle-class Puerto Rican family in the New Orleans, Louisiana, area. His father was a prominent lawyer and social reformer. In 1910, Del Russo married Elise Del Russo, a legal student from Puerto Rico, in what was a racially charged time in the United States. They had three children. Antonio's father was a member of the National Urban League.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 Del Russo was one of the founders of the Institute of Progressive History in 1935. The Institute was modeled after the Institute of Political Economy of Harvard University.

His thesis, `` Caribbean Social Politics, 1890–1939 '', was published in 1940. In the 1960s, Del Russo's research became the basis for other `` postcolonial '' scholars and historians such as Mariano Real Jr., Alberto Montoya. and Ricardo Loizada. He had published several works of Caribbean sociology in the 1950s and 1960s, for example, `` Nacionalismo de la industria de la Frega '', and `` Familia educación de la Economía Social ''.Del Russo was the first academic to examine the theories and practices of Nineteenth century Spanish colonialism in Latin America. He also contributed to social and political theory, for example, The Political System of Spain, which is still considered one of the best, if not the best, classic in this area.

 = Theodore Hall =  
Sir Theodore Hall, FRS ( 1829 – 2 April 1921 ) was a Scottish physicist who made contributions in the field of statistical mechanics. He published 13 papers on physics in the Journal of Applied Physiology, which he edited, and nine in the Physical Review.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hall was born in Edinburgh to John Hamilton Hall, a surgeon, and his wife Hester Hall. He studied at King's College London, gaining his doctorate in 1858. In 1864 he joined Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, where he was head of the laboratory and junior lecturer in 1869–75. From 1876 until his retirement in 1917 he was an Associate Professor at the University of Edinburgh. In 1879 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1887 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Hall served as President of the Physical Society from its inception in 1883–84.  
   
   
 == Theories ==  
 Hall was influenced by Isaac Newton's Principia and James Clerk Maxwell's influential work in statistical mechanics. He suggested that statistical mechanics had the advantage of being fast and accurate, while classical mechanics was of little interest for the purpose of establishing how a small world operated. Hall saw that, although the quantity of particles was small, the amount of energy required to propel each particle was large, and the law of conservation of mass must be true, because as one particle traveled through a sphere, it lost energy from traveling backwards. This law must hold, in the case of a sphere, if all the particles in it exist in a single space, i.e., if the velocity of each particle as it travels through a circle increases linearly with the square of the radius. Thus, Hall's theorem can be expressed as

 Her husband, Lloyd Jones, developed an interest in landscape photography. Lloyd Jones travelled extensively, and in his spare time he taught photography at Liverpool High School. These travels would eventually lead to Jess choosing photographic techniques to photograph. In 1963 she obtained a contract as a photographic assistant to the newspaper Associated Newspapers.  
 The two met in the 1940s at Cardiff Agricultural University and their relationship grew and deepened to the point where they married in 1965.Jezlyn is particularly known for the $ 10 canvas gift baskets made of coastal plants and rocks, which she collected. She invited other gardeners to collect plants from schools and museums around Britain and put them on display. There were two cases of Catherine the Great's tobacco plant : A video camera mounted on her ( polished brass ) wrist and a standard lens attached to a glass.Catherine the Great's tobacco flower was observed on this display in its growing season.Catherine the Great's pipe plant, Chrysanthemum murina, was exhibited in Banks, Buckinghamshire and used in Jess's garden. In the garden it would form part of a sculpture of the Queen. This task was completed by Jess in 1966.

 = Edward Alexander Baker =  
Edward Alexander Baker ( July 13, 1743 – January 6, 1802 ) was an English physicist and philosopher.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Baker was born in Southwark, the son of a linen manufacturer, to Eustace Baker, a commercial printer, and Rebecca Anne. Edward was educated at King's College, London, and then at Harvard University. At the recommendation of Daniel Halley, his father converted to the Methodist religion in 1757. Baker entered King's College in 1759, graduating in 1762 with an MA. His studies were interrupted by both a distinguished career as a gentleman of the yeomanry and a tutoring position at the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Baker became a member of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society in 1765, a free member in 1767, and an honorary member in 1783.  
   
   
 == Life at Harvard ==  
 During his time at Harvard, Baker attended the meeting of the Harvard Academy for 1767–71.  
 In 1772 Baker was appointed Professor of Philosophy in the College of Physicians of Harvard University, named as such by the rector and the Chancellor of Harvard, Alexander H. Putnam. He was very successful in this position, serving as president from 1778 to 1784.  
 While at Harvard, Baker served as a student, was on the staff of one of the medical societies of England, and was president of the American Philosophical Society for two terms. His father contributed to the Society, and he had regular employment with it, including secretary to many of the founders.  
 In 1783, Baker entered the chair of Natural Philosophy and Physics at Harvard, being elected first professor in 1791. In 1795 he received the degree of Doctor of Letters. He was president of the Yale University Association for 1823 and 1825.  
 Baker was the author of fourteen works :  
 A Moral Aspect of the Wealth of Nations : Containing a Treatise on Wealth, Agriculture and Commerce  
 A Practical Remarks on the Principle of Cause and Effect  
 On Inequality of Authority  
 Recent Observations on The Secession of Monopolies and Trade-Unions  
 On the Loss of Ground in the Advance of Science  
 A Treatise on the Law of Parallel Forces  
 On the Ideal Basis of the Mechanism of Matter  
 On Certain Entire Points of Logic and Metaphysics  
 A Treatise on Metaphysics  
 On Natural History in Defence of Natural Philosophy  
 Observations on the Natural Representations of the Different Types of Images and the Enumeration of Images  
 The Moral Science and Philosophy of Thomas George Cromwell : A Contribution to its Growth and Useful Application to the Advancement of Man ( 1784 ), was published after Baker's death, with copious notes, as a compendium of his thought.  
 Baker died in Harvard Hospital on January 6, 1802.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Edward Baker was known as a `` man of science ''. He was a student of John Locke and Benjamin Franklin, and argued both theories at a very early age. Baker's predictions of the revolutionary consequences of scientific change were very much like those of the supporters of the spread of the spread of racial purity theory during the 20th century.  
 On his death, Harvard President James Madison dedicated his life to Baker's memory. Baker's statistics, his well known library, and his devotion to this cause are often cited in his memory. His final retirement was motivated by a family tradition of extreme adherance to the constitutionality of the American university system.Although Edward Baker is commemorated by both the Harvard University namesakes of Nicholas Rees and John Baker and is addressed by some as the father of a philosophy of science, he did not work for, nor in turn, advance, physics.

 Mary was born in Kilbride, Herefordshire and began his career at Glasgow University, where he received a First Class Honours degree in 1916. He returned to Glasgow in 1919 to become a lecturer in mathematics and statistics there, a post he held until the early 1950s. He then moved to the UK to work at the University of Manchester and at King's College London. He became Professor of Statistics in 1931. He was Reader in Statistics at the University of Edinburgh in 1940 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. He held similar roles at the University of North London and Sheffield University. His achievements as a statistician include his assessment of the 'highly developed'inequalities of the Pearson correlation coefficient, in 1925, for the time period 1931–1933. He also proposed the concept of a super-value of parity in 1926 and, from 1950, at the United Nations Statistical Service ( UNESP ), created the standard measure of unemployment.Mary was an influential figure in the field of human physiology and nutrition, and his research was important for understanding how obesity was caused by, and to prevent, obesity.  
 His publications included ( together with J H Cole ) :  
   
 A Service for the Measurement of the Prevalence of Obesity in England and Wales ; and  
 The Rate of Childhood and Early Midlife Enlargement, 1926.

 == Biography ==  
 Löpke was born in Cologne, the son of a farmer. He studied geography in Leipzig, then in Berlin, and geology at the Universities of Berlin, Göttingen, and Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1845. His first book, Deutschlands Archäologisches Landes ( German Archipelagos ), was published in 1848. It was translated into French as Monsieur Maître and in 1855 into English by A. P. Stanley. In 1862, he became assistant at the museum at Berlin, later becoming director, in 1863–4 a professor, and in 1867 a de facto minister.  
 Löpke had distinguished career in ancient, prehistoric and modern sciences, including his long contacts with Alexander von Humboldt, Johann Georg Haeckel, Robert Mott ( Immanuel Kant's mother ), Tübingen, Vienna, and Leipzig. Among his pupils at the University of Leipzig was Berthold Marinus von Groot, one of the founders of early systematic philosophy. Among his other students at the newly established Staatsarchiv was Rüdiger Beck, who was afterwards one of the main interpreters of G.E. Moore's groundbreaking work Das Altenbereiche, Der Bedeutungsgeographie des Berlin-Das Altertums und der Erster Königfrau. In 1856–6 he headed the Munich school of architectural studies. Löpke died in Munich in 1870 and is buried in the Stütznau cemetery.

 = Johann Hahn =  
Johann Hoffmann ( Hebrew : אמן אנין‎ ) ( 27 October 1649 – 12 May 1713 ) was an Austrian alchemist and physician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hoffmann was born in Vienna to an early merchant family. His father was a wine merchant. In the summer of 1687, he went on an expedition to Altdorf to explore some local caves. Hoffmann quickly became interested in alchemy and quickly understood the nature of alchemy, so much so that he started to teach himself, being able to make much more advanced scientific studies.In 1692, Hoffmann began work on a grand-project of his own, and an early draft of what is now the Altdorf Encyclopædia of Science was finished in August 1693, under the direction of the young Altdorf chemist Johannes Heinrich Beltrammieck. After Beltrammieck died in 1706, it was relocated to Trier, where the work was continued by Maria Widor for two more years. The standard author abbreviation Hahn is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.  
 In 1803, Hoffmann started a natural philosophy with his PhD student Johannes Gatt. In the natural philosophy, such as the ideas of wave mechanics, the self, and Pareto principle, had developed, and it is probable that he was the first natural philosopher to propose these ideas in a scientific manner.  
 In 1808, Hoffmann published his Neue Naturalphilosophie in Traktordnung, or an Elementary Alphabet of Practical Philosophy ( 한만프로 마프한만프한프프 ). In the 17th century, he started using the three-letter abbreviation Hahn, an abbreviation of the French word Haber, which means `` book of theories ''.In 1811, Johann Abraham Cramer began Hahn's work on Hydrostatics, a mathematical system he had invented in collaboration with Paulus Nicolaus Jacobus Holst and his friend Georg Matthias Gane ( also known as Johann Abraham ). Hahn considered his methodology the most useful, although he never used this method in his own works. He is sometimes referred to as the `` father of hydrostatics '' by some biographers and biographical sources.Hoffmann was buried in Paderborn, in Berlin.

After serving as Vice Chancellor at the Federal University of Gaziantep from 1974 to 1976, he became its President in 1980. He was the Chairman of the ÖZN Party from 1982 to 1986, when he and his party was outlawed by the government. In 1989, he died of a heart attack.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Mustafa Husain was born in 1923 in Istanbul. He attended Taksim University and then Istanbul University, where he obtained a scholarship, studying politics and economics. He became a civil servant and an important figure in the movement of Turkish nationalism. Between 1954 and 1970, he was also president of the influential ZAYT party.  
 In the late 1980s, Husain joined the ÖZN Party. In 1988, he joined the Islamic Freedom Party ( PUK ) as an independent and joined its executive and executive committee. The split occurred when the ÖZN leader, Mustafa Husain, publicly criticized Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's regime.In 1989, Husain called for the renationalisation of Turkey. He had criticized the PUK in 1990. In 1990, ÖZN was banned and his party was outlawed by the Turkish government. The ban was lifted when the government brought in new rules to put an end to the ban.  
 Husain was also a prominent author. He penned numerous articles on Turkey, including entitled `` Fate of the country as-is '' and `` Should Turkey be a Republic? ''. In 2003, the AKP-affiliated Nationalist Education Educational Front in Turkey launched a series of popular books titled `` Behold the Night '' to educate Muslims in their Arab and Muslim roots in order to encourage them to abandon their roots and adopt the state-funded Islamic education. One of them was a fictionalized book written in response to the ban by Mustafa Husain.

Stas Jakob Jellandj ( Czech pronunciation : [ ˈʲas ˈjɑn. jɛlɑːj ˈjaːj ˈdʲɑːd ] ; 12 July 1871 in Česká Štiavnica – 23 October 1944 in Zagreb ) was a Slovenian anatomist who is best known for his research into the musculoskeletal system of the human body. He was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Academie Nationale de l'Académie de Médecine and the National Academy of Sciences of Latvia. He was known for his scientific analysis of the structure and function of skeletal muscles, the most prominent of which is the regulation of the epiphyseal muscles. He studied the cadaverous musculature and related structures of the human body, and subsequently performed studies into the physiology, pathophysiology, and pathological factors underlying this complex system. He was the author of numerous papers, the most notable of which, published in 1964, is History of the Epiphyseal Muscles, published in collaboration with Jost Jankowski, was a tribute to Jellandj.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Born in Zagreb, Jellandj spent the first fifteen years of his life in Zagreb.  
   
   
 === Teaching ===  
 Jellandj graduated in 1899, with a doctorate degree in medicine from the University of Zagreb, becoming a lecturer in 1906, assistant professor of anatomy in 1912, and professor of physiology in 1924. He was made director of the department of anatomy and neurosurgery in Zagreb University in 1918.  
   
   
 === Medical practice ===  
 During World War I Jellandj served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, of which he was commissioned colonel. He returned to Zagreb in 1917, taking up the position of Professor of Surgery and Biophysics at the Faculty of Medicine of Zagreb University. In 1922, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal German Academy of Sciences, and the Croonian Society of Great Britain, where he remained until his death.  
   
   
 === Research ===  
 In 1923, Jellandj described the epiphyseal muscles in the molar region. He was interested in their history, the function of the muscles, and their interaction with the anatomical structures of the upper body. Jellandj's later research examined the pathophysiology of the epiphyseal muscles in patients with mesenteric diverticulitis, and he co-authored a book about the condition in collaboration with Jarkko Kotorović with a foreword by Carl Johan Kossuth, who was the first author of the controversial technique.  
 Jellandj's work has led to many improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of mesenteric diverticulitis, especially when compared to clinical and pathological factors. In 1970, he published Anatomical documentation of mesenteric diverticulitis ( 2nd edition ). In 1957, the first neurosurgical study and taxonomy of the epiphyseal muscles was completed and described by Jellandj. In 1993, the National Academy of Sciences of Latvia adopted the histologic classification of the epiphyseal muscles. In 1997, Jellandj authored a textbook about the epiphyseal muscles. In 2004, the first mesothelial cell culture system was constructed by his group. Jellandj published and contributed to the preprint of the book, Medical anatomy and biophysics, based on the book The anatomy and anatomy of musculature.  
 Jellandj worked in parallel with Jankowski to write a textbook on the origin and classification of musculature : Conformity and short-term plasticity in the skeletal muscle in its relation to the nervous system. He died in Zagreb on 23 October 1944.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The epiphyseal musculature of the human body, the anterior and posterior portions of the connective tissue structures that form the bones of the lower limbs, and the third midline of the pelvis ( posterior fossa or piloedema ), have been named in his honor.

 As we have seen, eigenvalues of homotopy groups are local when the curvature of the equation is negative and the sum of its subgroups is positive. This is generally the case in fixed points. However, n-trees containing only edges are then of negligible degree of curvature because their non-n-separable part has large singularities, and therefore all other simplifications need to be performed as there are large numbers of partial derivatives of the derivatives. Such elimination is known as paucity-shaping.  
 In everyday functional analysis, small subgroups of a structure have ordered representations, as illustrated in

 = Ernst Hans Homann =  
Ernst Hans Homann ( 20 September 1880 – 22 February 1961 ) was a German theoretical physicist, author, and physiologist. He is credited with coining the term energy and with establishing a scientific theory of waves, galvanic effect, absorption of light by water, and the particle and wave analyzer theory. Homann invented the prism microscope, which was introduced by Charles Wheatstone in 1904, in his book `` Optics and Photometry. '' In 1921 Homann successfully demonstrated the existence of the Pauli–Ribbon effect, and he proved the existence of the Lamb shift in the quantum field theory. He believed the mass of electron vibrations for small particles, the Lorentz transform of these vibrations, and the Lorentz transformation of solutions of Hilbert space geometry were significantly smaller than the Planck length of their wavelength.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Son of a teacher in Halle, Homann studied physics and mathematics at the Technical University of Munich, graduating in 1893. In 1905, at the age of 23, he became a laboratory assistant to Wolfgang Pauli. In 1908 Homann, along with his assistant Ernest Toussaint, showed that electron waves appear to have separate nuclei, which is as far from the prediction of special relativity as it was possible at that time to put forth. Homann's work contributed greatly to the field of electromagnetic theory and was cited by Friedrich Zinn in his theoretical derivation of the concept of `` systematic relativity ''. In 1921 he demonstrated the existence of the Pauli–Ribbon effect, a phenomenon that describes the phenomenon of induced resonances of phonons when they are distorted by an electric field. It is associated with the electric lens phenomena of optical transmission.  
 Homann was a founding editor of the journal Physikalische Zeitschrift.  
 In 1913 Homann was awarded a grant by the Munich Pharmacological Society to establish the Institute of Physiology in Munich. With the help of Paul Grün, he founded the Technical University of Munich-Chemical Institute of Biophysics and Pharmacology, now in its 25th year of existence.  
 After the outbreak of World War I, Homann made contributions to physics through experimental work in magnetism. In 1919 he was elected to membership of the Vertebrat in the German People's party ( DVP ), with the DVP becoming a separate electoral party in 1920. In 1922 Homann, along with Friedrich Schwarzschild, discovered the emission of X-rays with cesium. From 1924 Homann was a member of the newly formed Science and Education Commission for the first scientific congress of the Federation of German Scientists and Engineers.  
 After the reorganization of Germany in 1933, Homann became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and Humanities ( BAM ). After World War II, in 1948, he moved to the Niels Bohr Foundation for the study of the behaviour of nuclear fission. In 1957, he was invited by Richard Feynman to the International Astronomical Union at Göttingen for a five-day meeting on cosmic rays. In his years at the Niels Bohr Foundation, Homann developed his physics concepts, while studying with J. Pauli and in collaboration with Max Born. Later, he was an expert witness at the trial of Eugen von Braun and the resultant controversy over his work on atmospheric pressures.  
 After his death in 1961, his wife, Ethel Homann ( 1897–1975 ), is credited with developing one of the most popular gardening strategies of the 20th century in the first half of the 20th century, Homann's Rose Garden, an all-weeds garden that is presently one of the most popular gardens in the United States.  
   
   
 == Personal life and family ==  
 On 20 September 1880, his parents, Hans and Catherina von Köring, married in the town of Wittenberg. They had four children, three of whom died early : Johanna Rudolph  
 Georg Friedrich Homann  
 Wilhelmine Paula Salomon  
 Ernst Bernhard Homann  
 Karl-Heinz Homann.  
 Ernst Georg Christian Homann married in 1890 the widow of the physiologist Adolf Muller, in Munich. After she died, Ernst married her younger sister, Julia, in 1897. After Ernst's death, Adolf married Max Sophie Christiane-Lahti in 1895.

John Brady ( 11 September 1737 – 23 June 1831 ) was an English geologist, botanist, and poet. He was born at Breslau in western Germany, and died at Breslau.  
 In the middle of the 18th century, his writing was interred in the nearby Amberg cemetery, the remains of which are shown in the Natural History Museum.  
 Brady was a close friend of André Gide ( 1729-1818 ), father of Émile Gide ( 1772-1861 ). Émile was a researcher who visited Breslau in 1799, a year before Brady did, and shared several botanical specimens with him.  
 The phrase `` John Brady '' refers to André Gide and includes the surname Brady who had several children ; others named for him include Eli, Adolphe and Francis.  
 The species Bradyia is named for Brady.

Rudolf William Hehr CIE ( 22 June 1855 – 8 August 1936 ) was a British chemist and polymath.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Hartley, Lancashire, Hehr was the son of the doctor and insurance agent Edward Hehr, a younger brother of Thomas, the fellow ship-owner. He was educated at Cadbury School and then at St Albans Grammar School.  
 At the age of 19 Hehr was appointed assistant to John James Audubon in the zoology department at the London Zoo, where he studied taxonomy, evolution and embryology. In 1883 he left Zoology and returned to Hartley, becoming Privatdozent to the Alfred Smythian Society. In 1887, with an Honorary Doctorate, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1889, when Hehr was a curator at the Natural History Museum, he became Professor of Botany, and spent many months in Croatia in 1888-90. He received an honorary doctorate from St John's College, Cambridge in 1905, also awarded an Honorary LLD from Heriot-Watt.  
 He married in 1894 Susanna Agnes MacGregor Knox, daughter of William Knox, MP ( 1792–1873 ). They had one son, Paul MacGregor Knox ( 1895–1955 ), and two daughters : Marion John Knox ( 1900–1994 ), who was a retired judge, and Elizabeth Jane Knox ( 1900–1976 ).  
 He continued his studies of cryptogams, especially new diseases and their treatments, and published `` A Comprehensive Description of the Coluberia Virus and its Careers ( Recent Journal ) '', in 1896.  
 He retired in 1937 and was appointed Professor of Polymath at Cambridge in 1937. His publications include :  
   
 Herbert Garrett Wessels : The Origins of Inflation ( 1900 )  
 William Eno Wessels : Structures of Avian Anatomy ( 1904 )  
 William Eno Wessels : Physical Statistics ( 1912 )  
   
   
 == Inventions and discoveries ==  
 Hehr devised the AY-angle headlamp in 1887. It was used in the aviation industry from the mid-1920s, but only in the early days of World War II. The prototype consisted of a single cam mirror mounted at the tip of a branch which could be tilted on the face of a hook ( now used by mountaineers ), with which a light bulb could be attached, allowing a constant angle between the two. He had a special arrangement for this lamp which opened for the wearer, allowing light onto the head which was obscured by the hook to enter. The headlamp was of a flat design, with a hook at the tip ( which opened onto an `` Arch '' ) and a sliding plate within which the bulb was suspended from the barrel ( so it could be rotated backwards, for example as in a pencil eraser ). From 1907 to 1909 it was used in Britain by RAF pilots. In the autumn of 1907 the headlamp was tested successfully on the USGS's experimental aircraft Desert Storm.  
 The haptic insulator used by the Royal Aircraft Establishment for the APS was later called the Hehr-type, in honour of William Rudolf Hoch.

Thomas Berndt ( 22 March 1817, Coburg – 13 February 1891, Berlin ) was a German physicist and astronomer. He discovered a series of stars with redshifts above about −2 degrees. After his retirement in 1885, he was secretary of the Boer War Commission until 1894, when he returned to astronomy. Berndt described his observations as those of a `` city-world '' nebula. It was found to be an elliptical star cluster with a reddening of `` 1/10th of a degree '' ( or 1/100th of a degree ) in some directions, many of the brightest stars in the galaxy seen as `` patch-flares '' on the horizon.

 = William Dower Maney =  
William Dower Maney ( October 11, 1879 – February 13, 1964 ) was an American industrialist and inventor. Maney is also known for coining the terms `` high tech '' and `` low tech '' to refer to the new ideas and processes he introduced to increase the productivity of manufacturers and consumers of durable goods and services.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Dower Maney was born on October 11, 1879, in Bedford, Massachusetts. He attended Brown University, graduated from Harvard University, and received a bachelor's degree from Brown in 1923. He joined the U.S. Navy as a private in 1912, as part of an ad hoc program of services by the United States government's medical and scientific communities to obtain volunteers to search for marine petroleum supplies, and to treat it with hydrocarbons and other chemical solvents that were not normally used. During this period he did various research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was appointed instructor in marine engineering in 1923. Maney received his doctorate from Harvard in 1929.  
   
   
 == Industrial career ==  
 After the war ended, Maney joined a Washington, D.C. consulting firm called Mein & Bee, where he developed his original ideas about the concept of flow control and power transference, which are now known as Maney's Law and Maney flow. Thereafter, he was a consultant to such businesses as General Electric and Xerox. Dower Maney's first big contribution to the functional analysis industry was his work on industrial electronics and the design of a prototype world class electric oscillating typewriter known as the Cybuzz. A few years later, Maney started working with electrical engineering at General Electric, where he began developing industrial electrical engineering in the form of his Maney flow model for generating electrical conductivity. The problem that led to his patent of his grid transition technology was the dearth of suitable data on the long distance flux of conductive fluids and the principal concern was to find out the changes in wire resistance and the rate of transmission of the charge carriers. This work turned his thinking from the generation of path length and direction of discharges to the functional relations between the conductive fluxes and the electrical properties of the materials that comprise the circuit.  
 As a result of his research and development, most electrical devices are now constructed with specific characteristics in mind. For instance, in the early 1920s, Maney found that the temperature difference between a conducting conductor and a conducting metal became dramatically greater, creating a much larger load on that metal. For Maney, a large structural element was needed to actually make the flow control the critical characteristic of the process : a metal junction. In 1926, he founded the electric shocky glass manufacturing company for which he designed the first steel-coated glass cutters.It was Maney's deep research into industrial electrical engineering that led to his patent of the modern industrial flow control system, the Maney transducers, developed with ( among others ) Russell Wood ( 1901–1970 ), E.A.W. Miller ( 1917–1988 ), Fred Robinson ( 1919–2010 ), W.W.S. Dimick ( 1913–1992 ), G.W.M. Callister ( 1914–1966 ), Walter Reich ( 1921–1990 ), Werner Ihmüller ( 1934–1999 ), John E. Walker ( 1926–2008 ), Robert G. Wayne ( 1940–1996 ) and Frank Lee ( 1936–2005 ). A subsidiary of Bell Labs, Mein & Bee helped create the world-class telephone wire current transducers, designed for use in some of the earliest telephone systems.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Maney died on February 13, 1964, in Princeton, New Jersey. Maney is survived by his wife, Katharine Maney ; four daughters, Mary I., Jane, Jane, Amy and Betty ; and a son, Robert W. Maney.

 == Life and career ==  
 Britton was born in Annapolis, Maryland. She was the second of three children of Florence Britton ( née Johnson ) and Wesley Johnson. Wesley graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1928 and became a microbiologist. Florence began working at the Allianz Research Laboratories at Ithaca, New York in 1939, where she spent most of her career as an archaeologist. Britton joined the Society for American Archaeology ( SAA ) in 1956. As a botanist and Herpetologist, she traveled extensively in Europe to study the flora and fauna of the ancient world and Asia. She found that African forest plants, such as figs, did not originate from the West African region. The first entomological publication of European flora and fauna to contain synonyms was her first publication, coauthored with A. Collingwood, in 1957.  
 Britton died of kidney failure at Ritz-Carlton on May 25, 1970.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Britton was primarily interested in Alaskan birds, and especially the North Pacific brown bear. She made extensive study of Alaska populations of the northern bat, the Siberian nutria, and other Arctic predators. During her career, she documented numerous molt events of the peregrine falcon, which is still the world's most endangered species. Among her other research were North American snake snakes, the study of Alaskan sea lions, and the Pacific white-sided dolphin, the family Musacanthus. Britton was a member of the Southern California Exploring Expedition of 1910 and of the International Expedition of Vertebrate Paleontology of 1912. In 1931, she became an honorary member of the Society for American Archaeology.

 = Caspar van der Som (composer) =  
Caspar van der Som ( 12 February 1826 – 13 January 1900 ) was a Dutch composer, conductor and music theorist who was the son of C. D. van der Som and a grandson of Henriette Knopf. He studied piano, singing, harmony, harmony and singing in America, and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws in 1868.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Rotterdam ( Dutch pronunciation : [ ˈaʒúslɛ ] ), now part of the city of Rotterdam. He was the eldest of eight children. His father, a piano virtuoso and a pupil of Schoenberg, had taught his elder brother, Auguste van der Som, to play the piano. It was also during this period that van der Som was deeply interested in music, having heard the lectures of two legendary scholars, Johann Jakob Pring ( 1685-1715 ) and Robert Schumann ( 1693-1759 ), and was playing the harpsichord at about the age of five. He also drew a constant curiosity for music, studied it as a child, and afterwards studied it in Europe as a young man.  
 On the death of his father, van der Som inherited from his uncle the half-brothership of Louis van der Som, the brother of the mathematician Albert, whose mathematical work was one of van der Som's interests. Van der Som went on to study with Pring at the University of Jena, where he wrote his first music in 1893, one year after completing his doctorate. He studied in Jena with Kullback and studied music theory at the University of Leipzig with Matthias Radeck from 1898. He received a degree from Leipzig in 1903, with the dissertation Traité d'études de l'amour instrumentale, in which he analysed the function of the hand and the internal organs of a musical instrument. In 1901, he was appointed professor at the University of Amsterdam under K. Huse.In 1904 he married Nelly Schutte in Leiden, becoming a professor at the Amsterdam Conservatory in 1906. He was the composer of some 20 performances of his son's Ballet Fantasy, for which his book Miracles was published in 1908. That year he began composing, and his scores were edited by Jan van der Oudt, who was a musical admirer of van der Som's.  
   
 From 1909 to 1918 van der Som was Principal of the University of Amsterdam, and director of the Amsterdam Cathedral Choir from 1920. In the 1910s, he gave more popular concerts and was strongly influenced by the music of Wagner and Schubert. Van der Som died in Utrecht in 1900. He is commemorated in his obituary in Musical Times ( 1911 ). He had a daughter, Marianne Hjort-van de Velden, who became a noted soloist, composer and art historian.

He read at Christ's College, Cambridge and then studied natural history, taking his degree in 1800. He then moved to Oxford to work for his uncle Percy Watt, but returning to Derbyshire to work in his uncle's goldsmith shop. He received his PhD at the University of Oxford in 1803.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 Driggers was one of the founding members of the British Entomological Society in 1806. He was also secretary of the Society for the Advancement of Science 1807–1814, and secretary of the Royal Society from 1814 to 1818.  
 Driggers and his friend David Herrmann received a grant from the Natural History Museum to complete a series of experimental paper on the vectors of insects, consisting of hundreds of specimens.  
 In 1818, Driggers'work helped establish British Entomology to the international status it held for a century, with the founding of Entomological Week and European Entomological Congresses. In addition, Driggers'contributions to entomology are recognized by a number of species of venomous insects, including Larus sapectalis, Dovesworth's betel nutria, and Chalcidinae ( particularly of South Africa ).  
 A genus, Driggersia was named for him.He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1818 and a fellow of the Zoological Society of London in 1820. In 1826 he was elected president of the Entomological Society of America.In 1825, he and other Englishmen, including the entomologist Francis Arnold ( who had become an artist ), established the Neuordnungshunde as an entomological club ; its current meetings take place in Derby.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Several cuckoos were named after Driggers :  
   
 Driggers'cage, an enclosure for cattle in which they were kept during the breeding season, was installed at Bonham College by librarian M. J. Day in the 19th century.  
 The ornithological journal of the Entomological Society was founded in 1824 by Thomas Warren in partnership with the ornithologist Daniel Driggers.  
 A protoplasmic silkworm, Anatotoma driggersii, is named in his honour.  
 `` Driggers'leaf-beak '' in the family Salix ( Cucurbitaceae ) is named for him.

 = Jos C3 A9vors Christensen =  
Josávors Christensen ( 1797–1884 ) was a Norwegian zoologist and the first director of the Natural History Museum in Oslo. He was Professor of Zoology at the University of Oslo from 1824 to 1838. He is remembered for the textbook Evolution of the Animal Kingdom ( 1824–1838 ), one of the most frequently used books in scientific zoology of that time.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Bævik and attended the Lutheran church. He had a pioneering scientific career, and was a founder and director of the zoological department at the University of Oslo from 1824 to 1838. At the beginning of 1826, when the Danish king Frederick Augustus von Nordenskjöld introduced his system of scientific taxonomy and culture to Norway, he began by translating the works of Olaus Magnus ( to whom he belonged ), by Pausanias, Enthrallius, Carl Linnaeus, and Aveling, and prepared a codex for his collection. Around 1831, he also started to produce birds, together with a large number of fishes.  
 A modest man, he was educated to become a pastor. After obtaining his doctorate, he went to Copenhagen and was a superintendent for the purchase of fish. He became friendly with the schoolmaster Ingald Lundell.He was twice elected president of the Royal Norwegian Society. From 1832 until 1836, he served as the first director of the Zoological Museum. In 1835 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Oslo, but instead of continuing this position, in 1845 he resigned and relocated to Copenhagen, as director of the Natural History Museum. He also published a comprehensive monograph of the structures of the bird brain, entitled “ Nordbladetende blajtet ”, to which he was appointed a life member in 1848.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 A brief account of some of the zoological discoveries made by him is given in the essay Pasaarbunde sormelsem ( 1824 ), in which he comments on some of the earlier problems and points of departure from zoology and anatomy. He himself presented a proof of the laws of thermodynamics for the vertebrate body, and presented his results to a public exhibition in Copenhagen. In a letter to Petter Christoffer Holm and to his brother Enzo, F.F., he denied that carbon was the ultimate cause of motion in the vertebrate body, and argued that muscle originates from molecules of water. A second attempt was made by this opponent to rehabilitate F.F. Holm's original theory of muscles. In this attempt, Helge Moltke, being appointed curator of the zoological museum, opposed the authors of the book, asserted the anatomical connection between meat and tissue, and suggested that `` other liquors, such as wine, should be invented in order to render the body suitable for digestion ''.Having obtained his PhD from the University of Copenhagen, he acted for a time as director of the Pragenschuleschool in Copenhagen. From 1839 to 1846, he was a professor of zoology at the University of Oslo. Between 1845 and 1848, he served as the first director of the Zoological Museum.

 = Clement Chevillard =  
Clement Chevillard ( French : [ Ēçoḷnɑk ] ; 17 September 1881 – 7 November 1970 ) was a French historian and specialist in Oriental languages.  
 Chevillard studied the dialects of Native Americans and served as director of a school for Native Americans. He argued that groups of Indigenous people on the North American continent spoke `` North Americanized '' languages. The aim of his thesis, published in 1902 as Qu'est-ce que les Hois en Afrique Indépendance? ( `` Where are the people of the North American continent and of the North African continent speaking the same language? '' ), was to demonstrate the dominance of the Old World languages over what he thought were `` continental '' ones in native North American languages, notably with regards to Qu'est-ce que les Hautes Paroles. He made considerable contributions to ethnological research, such as his writing the Dictionary of Aboriginal America ( 1914 ) and the Americanity of Nations ( 1936 ).  
 Chevillard's work on language has received a great deal of attention and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1918. He was the author of three books.

 = William Browning =  
William Browning ( April 24, 1758 – July 21, 1823 ) was a London physician and naval surgeon who explored the western coast of Australia for the Pacific Company in 1780. During this time he also formed alliances with other European captains and ships to search for ships that would retrieve objects stolen from the Indian settlements.Browning left the Kootenay Company soon after it was founded in 1772, and returned to London in July 1782. Soon after he left, he wrote a letter to Captain Charles Lord Spiteful in which he blamed the Company for reducing him to poverty, saying that he had not enough money to support himself, his wife and his son. He believed that the ships of the Kootenay Company could not go through the Straits of Malacca because they were burdened with too many Native men's clothing.  
 In early 1813 he left Britain in the Himalayas on an expedition led by Captain William Marvell ( 1733–1819 ) and Captain Alexander Thomson ( 1732–1834 ), and proceeded through Iran, Iraq, and through Persia into Iraq. This journey, based on speculation, of Browning's description of the city of Susa in Bactria, was conducted at a cost of £56,400.In 1814, Browning travelled to Java to recruit new colonists, and then to Johore and Java on a second expedition. This time he enlisted the assistance of other Europeans, including Samuel Forbes ( 1752–1823 ), William Millar ( 1766–1840 ) and Captain Joseph Cockayne ( 1777–1857 ). Both expeditions failed in Singapore.  
 During the period of his professional and legal career, Browning tried to sell a collection of fish, along with specimens, to the Bombay Magazine for $ 65,000 ( about £28,000 then ). The collection included 26 tons of shark fins, but Browning saw the sale as a colossal waste.  
 In 1820, he returned to London to become the `` Counselor '' to the Bombay University in what was to become the city of Bombay. There he undertook medical experiments on hungry prisoners in a newly designed institution, and was badly beaten by his colleagues in a medical trial after which he died.

 = Joshua Pollak =  
Joshua Pollak ( January 20, 1894 – January 27, 1990 ) was a physicist and space scientist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Pollak was born on January 20, 1894 in New York City. He attended Brooklyn Academy of Music where he was elected a first-class honoree in classical music. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Queens College, a master's from the University of St Andrews, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Columbia University. He then became a professor of physics at the University of Chicago. He was named chair of the Department of Physics in 1920 and retired in 1926.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was Director of the Physics Division at the United States Air Force Observatory in the Department of Physics and Technology in the latter part of World War II. He co-founded the Society for Experimental Physics in 1931.  
 He was the first to propose the metalliferous-particle idea in the early 1940s. His ideas were included in the Adjacent Future section of the third edition of Arthur B. Compton's The Distant Future : On Science, Man, and the Law of Acceleration.He was among the first to experimentally investigate electrostatic discharge in electricity. He became president of the American Physical Society in 1941, the national president in 1947, and, during the 1930s, served as chairman of the American Physical Society. He also became director of the National Bureau of Standards and was in charge of the NSA's second atomic energy commission.Pollak was also responsible for assigning the first atomic energy collision survey to the United States government, in 1946.  
 In 1950 Pollak became the first president of the American Physical Society, and served from 1953 until 1962.  
 Pollak was a member of several committees in the United States and abroad. The 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ', created by the United Nations under UN auspices, was a predecessor of the World Meteorological Organization.Pollak was the first to demonstrate ionospheric temperature response in 1946, and the first to demonstrate the correlation between changes in atmospheric humidity and temperature changes, which is an important feedback to both dynamic and absolute variations in atmospheric temperature.Pollak was a notable proponent of accelerated aging. His research suggested that people live longer than expected, and he speculated that the possible impact of aging on health would be affected by an increase in bone loss. He used retrograde hypoxia, a form of hydrostatic stress that he perceived as detrimental to both medical functioning and human well-being. This occurred due to an increased incidence of reactive oxygen species, which is a key to a wide range of medical problems, including hypertension, asthma, cardiovascular problems and even cancer.

William William Lowndes ( 5 February 1771 – 3 January 1849 ) was an English politician, politician and pioneer physician in rural England. He is credited with originating the inoculation of livestock for medical purposes.  
 Lowndes was born in Sunderland, Middlesex, and is regarded as one of the pioneers of early modern medicine. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Liverpool, and at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and also practiced at St Thomas's Hospital and St Mary's Hospital. He held many ministerial positions in England, including the late William Petty.  
 He described vaccines and applied medicine extensively, and contributed to the physiological theories of the physician Francis Marion. For twenty years, he served as Secretary of the Bodleian Society.  
 In 1792, Lowndes was elected President of the Committee on Medical Education of Parliament, and was given the task of creating a national library, complete with an ancient manuscript on England's ancient royal library and an admixture of botanical books. This project was taken up in 1794 by Henry James, but the proposals were rejected due to royal disapproval. This failure of James'project resulted in the New and better method of preserving materiel, which Lowndes and James developed in 1809. In 1815 he published `` History of Medicine '', a book which was to prove a precursor to the clinical writings of Robert Jackson. He also authored 1859, ( the standard historian ), `` Life of Dr. Thomas Midland '' ( revised with additions in 1967 ), `` Rural Surgery '', and `` The Legal Profession '' ( revised with amendments in 1972 ).

 = Helen Lee =  
Helen Lee FRS FRSE ( 14 August 1885 – 8 November 1968 ) was a British statistician who specialised in the life tables, and later particularly on the life tables. She founded the Life Tables Society.  
   
   
 == Life Tables ==  
 Lee first devised the, and promoted, the `` life tables '', the first collection of these tables which gave detailed information on various aspects of health and survival of those with various medical conditions. In 1913 she added detail about physical health for miners, the minimum level of drinking water required for health and metabolic strength for pregnant women, and so on.  
 Lee's life tables became the basis of statistical methods and research from the 1920s to the 1950s. At the time, World War I was raging, and there was a need to research what a war based on war would mean for the populations in other parts of the world. However, Lee considered such calculations in any force to be impractical, because populations in war zones also lived in different environments which would affect the health of their populations, and all data from places in the war zones was vital to future generations to help make any scientific predictions.Lee and her husband, Thomas Emery Lee, conceived of the subject based on her experience of being sick and in constant need of the emergency hospital. Lee had to measure movement of vital organs throughout her body. These vital statistics she was able to obtain from patients were essential to the development of war rationing during World War I and later. The methods she devised became known as the Emery and Lee's decision theory.  
   
   
 == Awards and honours ==  
 Lee was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1921 and became a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( 1921 ), Foreign Member of the Linnean Society ( 1924 ), and Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( 1925 ). In 1950, she was appointed a Companion of the Order of the British Empire.  
 In 1975 Lee was elected to the Queen ’ s Birthday Honours list for public services in `` Peace, Women ’ s and the World, the British Department of International Affairs and the United Nations,'s. '' Her 100th birthday is celebrated annually on 20 May.  
 Lee was married to the anthropologist and psychiatrist Arthur J. Lee. She had a son, the psychologist and physiologist Edward J. Lee, and a daughter, the pianist Nancy S. Lee.

Maximilian Reder ( 27 June 1732 in Arden – 23 May 1805 in Vienna ) was a German violinist and pedagogue.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Arden, at the time the capital of the Electorate of Eisenach. He studied at the Gymnasium of Arden and the Staatliches Musikhochschule in Prague. He then joined the Stradivarius Guild in London and there in 1756 joined the orchestra of the Royal Opera House in London.  
 In 1759, Reder accepted the first violin of Louis Kahn, and immediately was employed with Kahn in an acclaimed attack at the Dresden Philharmonic at the Oberpfaffenhofen Orchestra. He then returned to Prague and acted under the direction of the composer, Peter Rose, the youngest member of that orchestra. However, in 1807 the Duke of Prague died and the situation became more and more difficult. He was obliged to leave Prague. He went to Salzburg with Kahn and also to Leipzig and Berlin. He was also recruited to the orchestra of the Amstelveen, and it was here that he appeared at Dresden on the 20th of June 1805 to perform the title concerto, Die Guten ( Suites ), by Alexander Strauss. This was a change in style from Strauss's last works, the Symphonies, in which he had been known. Reder's performance was generally popular, and it was announced at this time that he was to succeed Richard Strauss as Professor of Strings at the Vienna Conservatory. The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm in Vienna, and the orchestra was taken in great numbers to hear the new teacher.  
 For four years Reder continued his activities as the teacher, conducting and playing on several occasions.He returned to Prague and founded the Prague String Quartet under Otto Ritter. From 1784 to 1787 he was member of the Duchy of Königsberg. In 1789 he was director of the State Opera of Prague. He was an advocate of education, and often used the teachers of other countries. He was elected by the assembly to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1790, and to the Royal Academy in 1793.  
 In 1804 Reder founded the Prague Philharmonic Society, a society `` dedicated to music in this blessed city '', and was its editor. The club was dissolved in 1807, and in 1805 he was brought to an early and painful death.  
 His pupils were Johann Sebastian Bach, Walther Grün, Carl Ludwig, Carl Wien, Alfredo Gazetter and Carl Meissner.  
 In 1780 he died at his house in Diagon Rue, on the recommendation of Baron Friedrich Klotz.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 He married Sophie Joachim Louise Beit-Stuhl, née Mayer, on the 15th of August 1766 in Altenburg. The first son born to their first marriage was born to Maximilian and Sophie Josefina and died on 12 July 1826 in Hirschbach. The second son was born on 14 August 1778 and died in Hirschbach.  
   
   
 == Artistic work ==  
 The `` Antonio Alkan '' ( by Samuel Butler ) was composed in Prague in 1799.  
 The playing of the viola for the Chamber orchestra of the University of Vienna in its first season, 1790, is dedicated to Maximilian Reder.  
 In the Todt Butenpfaffen, composed in 1788, from a former friendship with the pianist Johann Sebastian Bach, is dedicated the Violin Sonata, first pieces of Bach.

 = Ingemar Craczkow =  
Ingemar Craczkow ( Polish pronunciation : [ ˈisːɡaːlka ] ; 23 February 1920 – 20 November 1986 ) was a Polish economist who, with Nikolai Stokolsky, used financial statistics to develop mathematical models to construct theories of trade and production cycles. These models subsequently played an important role in the Stork–Stokolsky equation, a widely cited economic calculation that is one of the best predictors of future economic performance.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Craczkow was born to a family of impoverished Polish parents, of Jewish descent. Craczkow studied at Warsaw State University. His advisor was a young economist named Jacek Kalkar, who had, like Craczkow, been heavily influenced by his father. In 1926, Craczkow graduated from Warsaw State University, and became a full professor there, winning the `` prestigious Dylusk Prize '' ( 1938 ) for his work in actuarial economics.  
 Craczkow founded the Polish Statistical Society ( 1962–2003 ) and taught the Theory of Trade at the newly opened university, now Warsaw University of Economics. It was while at the university that Craczkow discovered the statistical technique known as financial statistics. In particular, he discovered the statistical transformation of entries on a database into unique terms. Craczkow is often considered the inventor of this technique, a name used by some in his time to describe his method. His book about financial statistics became a bestseller, and is considered a classic.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 As Stokolsky and Craczkow advanced their economic research, Craczkow's theories became less and less influential. The Ukrainian communist government instituted liberalization in the Polish economy. Economists without a strong political agenda started to favor fiscal discipline and external trade policy that focused on structural factors like income distribution. It is also believed that, by the early 1950s, the economic changes brought about by the rise of communism were a great wakeup call for Stokolsky. Stokolsky believed that the strong social policies of the Soviet Union had reduced the share of the national income going to wages and salaries by over 50 %. Craczkow realized that new financial instrumentation should be introduced to predict new economic and political events, such as military and economic war and the emergence of a communist-led USSR. In 1962, Craczkow and Kalkar published their Economics and the Cycle ( Baruch Auerbach and Ingemar Craczkow, 1972 ), a landmark work that turned the mathematical approach from the aid of Stokolsky's models into a treatise about political cycles.  
 In the early 1970s, Craczkow participated in the Warsaw Summit to implement reforms to Poland's national currency. The paper recommended the introduction of the euro, a new and stable currency that was backed by the national currency of Poland and was internationally recognized. Craczkow was one of the main supporters of the introduction of the euro. However, a political breakdown in 1980 led to the removal of the agreement, and the monetary policy of the integration government was revised as of November 1984. Craczkow's last published research was on the contributions that the Soviet intervention in Hungary had made in the Soviet Union's reform of the currency policy.  
 Craczkow became a member of the board of the Institute of Economic Studies of the Academy of Sciences, in 1990. In 1992, the Institute of Economic Sciences granted him the Polish Order of the Danubian Star for his contributions to Polish economics.  
 Craczkow died in 1986.

Leonard George Royer FRS ( February 17, 1915 – June 20, 2005 ) was a British physicist and physicist with the Royal Society. He was the President of the Royal Society in 1984.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Royer was born on February 17, 1915, in Hertford, to George Donald and Dora ( née Moore ) Royer. In 1934, he enrolled at the University of Birmingham to study physics, but found his interest for mathematics and later quantum mechanics, and did not finish it. He attended Glasgow University, where he met with Albert Einstein, and went on to study at the University of Edinburgh in 1938.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At Edinburgh, Royer met Niels Bohr and worked on their theories of nuclear fission. Royer also conducted experiments that showed the occurrence of heavy elements in rocks using the case of atomic nuclei. Royer then published a paper on a graphical description of Brownian motion in the atmosphere. His theory of Brownian motion was independently researched by J C Haldane, William Seabrook, Alfred Mersenne, and Fritz Strassmann. When asked about Royer's work in science, Georg Cantor stated that he was `` a great friend '' of Royer.  
   
   
 == Scientific writings ==  
 Royer wrote several books and papers on general physics, such as Systematic Theories of Nuclear Theory ( 1940 ) and The Theory of Fluids ( 1944 ), both co-authored with Guido Banach. Other publications included The Theory of Irradiation ( 1957 ) and The Structure of the Environment ( 1962 ).

 = George Peter Green =  
George Peter Green ( 21 May 1922 – 9 October 2001 ) was an American economist and sociologist. He was born on 21 May 1922, in Springfield, Massachusetts, to William Peter Green and Margery Dorothy Minton. His father was a carpenter and Green was raised by his mother until his early teens. His mother taught him English and social studies when Green was young.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Green earned his BA in economics from the University of Chicago, and his PhD in economics from Harvard University in the sociology of education. While studying sociology at Harvard, he worked as a research assistant for Walter Brown, the first Professor of Social Control at Harvard. Together, they conducted longitudinal research on white working-class school students and then expanded this to broader questions about black and Latino children and adults. In 1957, they published the book Income and Wealth, which became the standard reference for any student studying the social and economic problems facing American working class families.After completing his doctorate, Green began working as a social psychologist and wrote A Sociological and Economic System ( 1967 ). He was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1977, which provided him with the time and money to conduct a series of six research projects, which led to his book After Economics ( 1978 ). The project's `` conceptualization and integration '' ( pp. 32-33 ) focused on four educational institutions and its implications for public policy : public schools, colleges, and universities. These are summarized in a chapter titled `` The Future of Public Education : Considerations for Parents '' ( pp. 87-101 ), which Green followed up with another article, Public Policy Revisited ( 1980 ). At Harvard, Green was also an assistant to William C. Keene and a Fulbright Fellow.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After earning his Ph.D., Green continued to publish on the role of education in the development of children and the growing wealth of the world's peoples. He did research on a range of topics, and was one of the first to develop the sociological approach to social psychology. His work influenced the work of his twin brother Andrew Green who authored and translated both The Inner Child and What has Psychology Learned? ( 1983 ), which was written while Green was at Harvard. He left Harvard to be involved in the early civil rights movement with Frederick Douglass.Green spent the rest of his career teaching sociology at Columbia University and at the Boston University Graduate School of Education. He was the president of the American Sociological Association from 1985 until his death in 2001. In addition to continuing his work in social psychology, Green was an influential figure in what is known as the Hampton Project, an institute dedicated to promoting cooperation in the world. The Hampton Project has funded many academic and private organizations around the world.

 = Maurice Levi =  
Maurice Levi ( October 17, 1895 – February 2, 1995 ) was an American anthropologist.  
 Levi was born in Boston and educated in the City College of New York, University of Wisconsin, and Harvard University. In 1932, he received his PhD from Harvard and then taught at the University of California, Berkeley. He taught anthropology at the University of Virginia, UCLA, and at the University of Hawaii. After his retirement in 1960 he spent time as an associate professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His name is sometimes listed as Maurice Levi, as his biography describes him as `` one of the first to apply the study of human group functioning to the study of societies as a whole. `` Levi is remembered for the anthropological study of subhuman behavior and a number of other work, including The Kaiki ( 1929 ). His published works are summarized in five volumes ( 1927–1970 ) and are edited by Ruth A. Carpenter.  
 Levi was a prominent American study of colonialism, including his principal work, Beyond the Subhuman : A Study in the Anthropology of the Anthropocene ( 1954 ). Levi recognized, among other cultural and cultural patterns, that African Americans were becoming disproportionately vulnerable to negative social effects of capitalist modernization and African Americans'developing relations with other human groups. He was also the driving force behind the development of a new conception of anthropological imperialism.  
 He was especially critical of the use of tribal psychology by American sociologists and anthropologists, questioning the reliability of tribal practices and methods.In the 1970s, Levi became increasingly disillusioned with anthropological study of African Americans. He expressed disappointment that research about blacks failed to employ methods such as comparison, basic social relations, and karyotyping. In 1966, with Jewish author and anthropologist Zalman Paltiel, Levi published The Negro Negro in American Civilization.  
 Levi died in Los Angeles.

 = Josef Peplau =  
Josef Charles ( John ) Peplau ( 15 April 1854 in Aiport-la-Salm, New Guinea – 23 February 1929 in Macau ) was a German colonial administrator, ecologist, conservationist and travel writer. He made scientific contributions in forest management, research, river protection and planning. He was the founder of the Aiport-La-Salm ( `` New Island '' ) Conservation District.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Peplau was born in a small village at Aiport, New Guinea ( now in Hainan province, China ), son of an artilleryman. His uncle, a military officer, was raised in Aiport-la-Salm, and his mother in the hamlet of Macau. The family emigrated to China and settled in Calico in 1850. He studied agricultural science at Hong Kong University, but his involvement in politics did not interest him. After studying on the advice of his father, he became a botanist and researcher in Natal ( now in Swaziland ) in 1861, working at the latter's ( by then ) national government school.Peplau then joined the staff of the Government Colony Office in Macau, and, after being promoted to the rank of Deputy, he served as the first Assistant Commissioner for Forestry in 1867. He developed a deep interest in water rights, and assisted the Agricultural Workers Association to solve common problems among China's agricultural workers. He received a doctorate in 1799 from the University of Göttingen, and, after spending some time in Switzerland, worked as a doctor in Paris, where he read ethnology and botany. He continued to write and publish on forestry issues, and was elected a member of the Académie Royale des Sciences in 1887.  
 In 1890 he received the newly created Chair of Forestry in the Lend Lease College, Macau. He was replaced by Fritz vom Ihler ( 1848–1902 ), a German zoologist, as the head of the Forestry Department in 1891. He resigned his chair and took an acting appointment as manager of the agricultural work in Aiport, and was promoted to the rank of Commissioner in 1895.During 1896, he visited several Indian reservations, including Sarsayam on the Horn River and Singhbhum in Orissa. He became interested in the extent and features of forest, and encouraged local officials to seek ways of improving its condition.  
   
   
 == Conservation work ==  
 In 1900 Peplau established the Aiport-La-Salm Conservation District, replacing the broken boundary between what is now the Aiport la Salm Forest Area and the Amtalak District. He helped set up the Tanagabam District, and in 1903 established the Forest Conservation Council. He designed a dredged channel to the Ross River, which provided safe access for ships and ships-of-war.

His publications include Revolutions in Ecological Structure, a textbook on ecological evolution. He also co-authored The Evolutionary Place of a Landscape with James H. Gilson, a book that has been compared to John Muir's The Wilderness as a Landscape, referring to how landscape ecologists have 'evolved'in non-human animal forms to adapt to such environmental stresses. The book was reviewed by David Livingstone as a `` masterpiece. '' He also has a deep respect for the work of René Descartes, so much so that, in 2001, the University of California, Berkeley elected him honorary Tanglewood Professor Emeritus.

Dennis M. Harrison ( July 10, 1897 – April 6, 1994 ) was an American meteorologist and the former director of meteorology for the National Weather Service ( NWS ) in Washington, D.C. until his death from the complications of multiple sclerosis in 1994.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Dennis Harrison was born in San Diego, California, the second of three children born to Harriet Bennett Harrison, an opera singer, and Gerald Harrison. The youngest, George, was killed in a car accident when he was ten. After graduating from high school in 1926, he started to study law, becoming an associate and then an associate judge at the San Diego Bar Association. Harrison was appointed to the bar in 1937, and the following year to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit. He served as a deputy for the appeals division of the U.S. Department of Commerce from 1937 to 1942 and, in 1941, was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After the war, he moved to Washington to assume the position of director of the NWS's main weather office in the District, remaining there until 1969.  
   
   
 === Role at NWS ===  
 Harrison was designated director of the National Weather Service in October 1942, replacing Edward C. Guthrie. During the early part of World War II, Harrison was president of the weather section of the National Federation of the Arts and in 1944 he joined the editorial staff of the magazine The Washington Evening Star.  
 After the war, Harrison became director of the United States Coast Guard Weather Service, a position that he held from February 1947 until his death. He was reelected to the office in 1953. As director of the Weather Bureau, he conducted a series of weather forecasting trips to the coasts of North America in the 1930s and 1940s that are still used to this day. In 1952, Harrison was awarded the Edgar C. Breitkopf Medal by the Royal Meteorological Society.  
   
   
 === Death ===  
 Harrison succumbed to the effects of multiple sclerosis shortly after being announced as director of the National Weather Service in April 1994.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 The Dennis M. Harrison Award ( 1959 ), a weather forecasting prize established by the National Weather Service and the United States Coast Guard Weather Service, is awarded annually to the best amateur and senior member of the meteorology profession.  
   
   
 == Literature ==  
 Interest in medical history of professional weather forecasters are characterized by a change from the older emphasis on `` chronological annals '' to `` clinical histories ''. This shift occurs mainly because the focus of medical history in meteorology is increasingly on pathology, only possibly a component of meteorology ( Cohen, 1994 ).

 Kirkat described a number of of rocks, in particular lignite and matilde-siltstones ( kirkatites ), and one particularly interesting fissure geology ( kirkatonsstolite ). The name `` Kirkat `` comes from Kirkat's Well, a coal mine near Weybridge in Perthshire, which he investigated after he was elected a fellow of the society. He developed an `` assay technique '' for determining depth-water ratios in rock, in which he used thin-layer pleodic rocks. The technique was extended to many other rocks, particularly mineral inclusion rates, which were early predecessors of the tomography technique. He also developed new types of gneiss in the isotope determination, called `` Kirkat crystals '' ( [ kirkat ] ).  
 Kirkat ’ s work on clay and associated fossils was extensive, and there are at least twelve papers and a large number of publications with him on geology ( see Bibliography ), all of which provide extensive information on the formation and structure of clay. The subject was deeply enlivened by Kirkat's encyclopedic knowledge of clay. A book of Kirkat papers edited by his friend Dorothy Lyons, former student, The Cadbury Solution, was published in 1966, two years after his death, as a companion to Cadbury's new Cadbury Cookery.

Yvonne Olen =  
Yvonne Olen ( May 6, 1886 in Paris - December 11, 1981 in Bremen ) was an American neurologist, best known for introducing the concept of temporal lobe epilepsy.In addition to her work as a medical doctor, she was a member of the faculty of the University of Bremen, in which her students included French neurologist Eugène Merrier. She died of liver cancer in Bremen in 1981, aged 82.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Yvonne Olen was born in Paris to a wealthy Jewish family in 1887. She was educated in France, Germany, and Switzerland and obtained a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1932. Later in life, she had a conflict with her husband, who was a neurologist. He argued with her about her expertise and her romantic life. Olen lost control of herself and began having epileptic seizures.Olen's parents did not have a particularly active Jewish lifestyle. Her father was an industrialist, but was a controversial figure ; both he and his wife suffered a succession of illnesses that put their children's lives in danger. Because of her father's financial conflicts, his physicians were hired mainly to provide health insurance for his children.Initially, Olen was much better qualified than her husband. She had an outsize interest in learning, going so far as to write a textbook for her daughters in neurology. As a teenager, she gave an award at the Marie Curie Festival at Paris, during the World War I, to the daughter of General Alfred von Stockhausen. It was referred to as the `` honorary medal '' and was `` paid by the whole department of neurology ''.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After leaving the University of Paris in 1934, she worked as an assistant to Professor Alfred Huguenin in the University of Bremen. By the time she was appointed as a full professor in 1949, she had trained an additional 25 neurologists and had more than 300 students. At the university, she also published 10 books and several articles. Olen joined the faculty of the University of Bremen in 1953. She remained there until she retired in 1980.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 When her results were published in 1959 in the Journal of the Royal Neurological Institute in England, Olen's work was hailed as the first evidence for the existence of a temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. However, even at this time, the prevailing notion was that ankylosing spondylitis ( a common form of neurology ) was the underlying cause of epileptic seizures. Olen was one of the first scientists to refer the causes of the cause, which were made public after years of intensive editing. Her work is still used to this day as a reference for researchers studying the etiology of temporal lobe epilepsy. In the last four decades, research has uncovered a wealth of scientific evidence that implicates prolonged periods of sleep deprivation in causing epileptic seizures.In 1976, British neurologist and orthopedic surgeon and political activist James Millar told of an encounter he had with Olen on a Saturday afternoon in 1954 : `` She was a great friend. She was even more brilliant at recovering from her epileptic episodes. I 'd be in jail if I knew how to deal with her. `` The American Journal of Medicine has listed Olen among the leading 25 people to have been instrumental in the development of the Testicular hypertrophy syndrome.

Elizabeth Ann Suter ( 23 November 1836 – 26 November 1909 ) was a Norwegian plant pathologist who performed research on fungi and botany and published many works, most notably a monograph on Cryptococcus, which she authored from 1869 to 1899.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Suter studied natural history at Ljubljana University before working as a nurse in Ljubljana from 1869 to 1872. In that year, Suter, her husband and four children emigrated to Norway. She took part in the 1875–1877 epidemic that killed over a thousand people in a secondary school in Bergen.In that year, Suter began to work for a geological survey. She worked from 1876 until 1886 on geology and paleontology in Bergen. She also attended the University of Bergen from 1886 until 1896, teaching geology and paleontology at the department. After graduation, she joined the Anthropological Society of Norway as an assistant.  
 In 1900, Suter published Cryptococcus, a monograph in Norwegian on the cryptogams of Ostrocybe and Selagine that she submitted in June, 1901 from a visit to her lab in Bergen.In 1901, Suter began studying plant pathology in Bergen. A portion of Cryptococcus was published in the 1903 edition of the Lebens- und Heligensbiologisches Zeitschrift. Suter's work on Cryptococcus made her the first to examine the diseases of the corky endocardium and embryotrophs in plants.In 1912, Suter became a Professor of Plant Pathology at the Norwegian University of Science and Letters, where she remained until 1939. In 1913, she was elected as an honorary member of the Royal Society of Bergen, and a full member in 1924.  
 She died on 26 November 1909.

 = Ilya Gergievich Guldi =  
Ilya Guldi ( June 17, 1910 – September 19, 1986 ) was a Russian economist, mathematician, and Professor of Economics at the Moscow State University ( MSU ). Guldi's major work was on special relativity and inflation.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Guldi graduated from Moscow State University ( MSU ) with a B.S. degree in 1930. In 1932 he was offered a position at the MSU by V.I. Chernyshevsky and L.A. Guldi. Guldi defended a thesis on `` History of the dynamics of money and price '' in 1934. In 1934 he joined the Moscow Economic Institute and did research on banking and insurance. In 1938, at the invitation of Imperial Russia, Guldi returned to Russia. He was the chairman of the committee of the Government of the Russian Federation to prepare `` a strong economic and statistical organization ''. The committee met in 1943 and 4 years later formed the Central Committee of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which Guldi served in until his death.  
 Guldi, together with A.G. Nabyshevsky and V.I. Chernyshevsky, together with other experts from the Moscow Economic Institute, developed statistical methods and methods of calculating the rates of interest and the interest component of the price.  
   
   
 == Theories and demonstrations ==  
 During World War II, Guldi demonstrated the statistical method of computing the rate of interest in collaboration with V.I. Chernyshevsky. A model of Russian economy was developed for accounting purposes which relied on statistical methods.  
 In an analysis of the first period of the Bank of Russia gold reserves ( 1949–1956 ), Guldi made the following observations. According to the average of a number of economists, by the beginning of 1955 the gold reserves were 2,498,000 lire and the rate of interest was 5.22 percent. Guldi concluded that :  
   
 In the first half of 1955, at the present rate of interest, Russia will hold approximately 70 percent of the world reserves.In February 1956, during a visit to the Moscow Academy of Economics, Guldi developed the theory of storage of funds in the central bank of the USSR. For this purpose he was the first to measure the relative rigidity of the `` money reserve '' of the central bank, which is simply the fractional reserve of the reserves of the other bank.  
   
   
 == Taxation ==  
 In one of the lectures, which was published by the Central Committee of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1988, he and a young economist Mikhail Gorney ( in 1928–29 when Gorney was the author of the `` neo-Marxism '' literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences ) elaborated and demonstrated the information economy, which had become the leading force of social development in the USSR. The concept of money `` storage '' and the concept of goods-changers ( i.e. goods that result from taking a monetary value and keeping it as a unit of account ) were introduced by him. They were combined in a new system of prices for goods and services.  
 Guldi distinguished four basic principles of practical theory :  
   
 price has its own value  
 prices have an inherent non-fractional basis  
 the free market maintains the system of prices in its institutions ( means of exchange, barter etc. )  
 the constant supply of prices leads to a stationary equilibrium of prices  
 prices are commonly calculable by an integrated flow-rate equation  
 prices follow the same sequence ( supply, demand, part and parcel )  
 the sale of a commodity does not change its value but only leads to its substitution in another commodity.In addition to this, Guldi introduced the concept of the Internet of Things ( then still in the testing stage ) which was much important to many people during the period of the Cyberworld.

 = Alexander Anthony Neale =  
Alexander Anthony Neale FRS FRSE ( February 19, 1878 – November 21, 1949 ) was a Scottish physicist.  
 He received a BSc in 1897 at Oxford University, and a PhD in 1899 from the University of Edinburgh. He was Director of the Royal Laboratory for Theoretical and Applied Mathematics ( 1912–1915 ) from 1912 until his retirement in 1934. From 1922 until his retirement he was the chair of University College of Edinburgh's Mathematical Sciences Department. From 1923 until his retirement in 1944 he was Professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London.The space age brought renewed interest in mathematical physics from the 1920s to the 1960s. A critical understanding of the theory of deflections, which had been in use for nearly two centuries, was being developed by other scholars in the fields of quantum mechanics and relativity, creating difficulties for the ‘ old ’ school. Neale had a key role in the development of the ‘ newer ’ ‘ r ’ technique ( in the physics of vacuum tubes, vacuum diffusion and of physical objects ), the beginnings of a theoretical and experimental technique which is still in use.Neale's work in the experimental study of refractive index and absorption of light ( often referred to as the use of light as a radar ) has led to several observations on refractive index and its sensitivity to scattering. One such was published in 1932 by Neale. He investigated the response of scattered light to refractive index, while using photoelectron spectroscopy.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Alexander Neale was born on February 19, 1878, in Cork, Ireland. He graduated from the Queen's University of Belfast in 1908. Neale entered the University of Cambridge as a graduate student in 1899. He was not a member of the Cambridge Mathematical Society at this time, and had no formal mathematical training. He worked initially on topology, where he had just received a Ph.D. under the supervision of the eminent George Hamilton. Later on, he was engaged in the foundations of applied mathematics in particular the mathematical analysis of problem theoretic properties of systems of continuous systems. He also worked on the theory of elastic light, using first-order logic to describe what is called the reflection of light through dense material such as silica into thin films. The use of what is now known as the Ceylon diagram in paper-folding sawmills and other physical systems to solve practical problems became very popular and established his position as a pioneer of physics and optics. He received a second Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1911.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1920, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and was a corresponding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1916 until his retirement in 1934. In 1933, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1935 and Professor of Experimental Physics at University College London in 1938.In 1936, he made a radical change in mathematical physics which is still used to this day : he applied first-order logic and mathematics to space to describe the structure of a process, called atomistic interpretation. He introduced the `` Nebel axiom '' ( as he called it ) in this work.In 1937 he became Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of London, and in 1948 Professor of Physics at the University of Glasgow, where he remained until his retirement in 1949. His work was closely allied with Charles Evarts, who in 1911 received a PhD under the supervision of Alexander Neale. Evarts was the founder of the field of condensed matter physics, and gave Neale a great deal of help in both developing and running the Glasgow group.

Alessandro Alberto Macedo Sada ( March 22, 1879 – April 20, 1945 ) was an Italian botanist and author who was mainly associated with a practical concern of the flora of Italy. The genus Sadaia is named in his honor.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Born in Rome, Sada was the fourth son of Ion Sada, a tailor, and Olivella Marica Moro, daughter of Marcello Marchetti, a famous silk merchant. The family moved to Trieste when he was 11 years old. He finished his secondary school in Palermo and then attended the Polytechnic School in Rome.  
   
   
 === University studies ===  
 He studied in Florence and Milano, where he attended the University of Bologna.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 As a young botanist, Sada joined the Italian Periapic and Mediterranean Co-operative Fund in 1885, in which his international research was funded by the firm. He also organized a garden and attended botanical seminars. During this time, Sada became a member of the Periapic Society in 1895, which his firm supplied equipment for.  
 Sada worked as an assistant to the physiologist and entrepreneur Silvio Ferniguzzi. In 1903 he married Caroline Sada, another botanist, who was of Turkish descent and son of a Turkish housekeeper. The marriage took place at the Montina del St. Felix de Marani in Rome. He later wrote two children, a son and a daughter.  
 In 1908, he moved to Milan, where he worked as a demonstrator at the Sapienza University and then, in 1909, started his own organic garden. His ideas about the uses of nature, and the process of cultivating it, attracted the attention of the scientific community in Milan. In 1912 he was granted a doctorate from the University of Rome. In the following year he became a member of the Institute of Agriculture of Milan. In 1921 he returned to Rome, where he remained until 1925.  
   
   
 === Florentine, oriental, and botanist groups ===  
 In addition to his associations with scientific organizations, Sada specialized in ethnic Germanic plants. In his native Turin he was a consultant of the Italian Periapic Society and of the Cooperative Fund of the University of Turin. He was also a member of the Italian Society for Botanical Collections ( 1926 ).  
 In 1911, he and a few others went to São Paulo and collected plants from the Amazon rainforest. In 1915, he opened an exotic garden in the avenue where Padre Valdano was said to live. It was the headquarters for a community of warblers, native to the Amazon basin, so named from a legend that Valdano owned a particular host tree. He also developed and implemented a plant identification system for local flora. He became the scientific advisor of the Iberian Botanical Society, an organization for plant classification and propagation in Brazil.  
 In addition to producing a series of books on plants, he also became the founder of the Flora Internazionale Italiana ( founded 1926 ), dedicated to documenting and cataloguing the flora of the European regions.  
   
   
 === Argentine branch of the Italian periapic society ===  
 On March 26, 1914, Sada was appointed as the representative of the Italian Periapic Society in Argentina. In 1922, the Argentine branch was formally established, with Sada as its president.

Doula Huleby ( January 19, 1848, in Minneapolis, Minnesota – July 22, 1908, in Plattsburgh, New York ) was an American educator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Huleby was born on January 19, 1848 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and graduated from the Minneapolis School of Arts and Sciences in 1876. She taught mathematics at Ball State University from 1877 to 1885, and after that she held teaching appointments in Chicago, Oregon, New York, and Minnesota. In 1893 she became instructor of the second grammar school in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where she was named principal in 1895. While teaching there, Huleby conducted experiments on women teachers, with the result that women now held considerable sway at the Pine Bluff School, and remained in that position until her retirement in 1909.As a mathematical teacher, Huleby wrote several mathematical textbooks for the use of students. In the first published textbook, Elementary Algebraic Number Concepts ( 1910 ), she suggested that the focus of the algebra was on processes, not sequences. A second published book, The Elementary Algebraic Theory of Quaternions ( 1913 ), was a study of infinite pairs, reducing them to compact rectangles by rearranging the ordinary differential equations for them to include abstract algebraic relations. She continued this tradition in 1922, with a book, The Mathematical Treatise of Functions of Differential Numbers ( in two parts ). Also in 1922 she published a fourth textbook, Formulas and Methods of Algebraic Number Theory. While in Minnesota she published articles on the history and theory of numbers, some of these were influential in American education, such as her 1923 book What The Numbers Mean?.  
   
   
 == Select writings ==  
 Huleby published many books, including The Elementary Algebraic Theory of Quaternions and Elementary Types, a textbook of the kind she had designed, and The Mathematical Treatise of Functions of Differential Numbers. She was also a proponent of functional analysis, and wrote on algebraic functions in general and the three-body problem in particular. Huleby published several articles that were significant in their time : articles in the Journal of Applied Mathematics in 1900, the Journal of the American Statistical Association in 1903, The Annals of the Mathematics Series of the American Mathematical Society in 1905, and The Annals of Mathematics in 1911.

 = Otto Wilhelm Friedrich von Dehnius =  
Otto Wilhelm Friedrich von Dehnius ( German : [ ˈoʁtər frɨntʁv jɪnju ] ; 28 June 1745 – 25 June 1805 ) was a German astronomer and astronomer, born at Egersdorff in 1813. He was a lieutenant-colonel in the Prussian Empire. Dehnius wrote A Prophetic Ascent and Vindication, but little else.  
 Dehnius is remembered for proposing his quadrant law ( Vindication ) to one of his superiors, Johann Abraham Dirick. This proposal was based on the axiom of partial differential equations. Dehnius, a Prussian politician, was elected to the Prussian Parliament, and the law became part of German astronomy.  
 The law also explained the rotation and eccentricity of the Earth, and as a later discovery disproved some of the famous comet theories of that time.  
 Dehnius had originally developed his idea in a mathematics paper, but the new law found its way into more serious scientific discussion in 1803. The proof of the law became a widely publicized phenomenon. Many geocachers maintained high standards, and in the 1820s Dehnius was given medals of honour by other states.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Otto Wilhelm Friedrich von Dehnius was born in Egersdorff, Prussia ( now Königsberg ) on 28 June 1745, the second son of Johann Abraham Dehnius ( 1705–1781 ) and his wife Susanne. His father worked at an ophthalmological clinic, and died when Otto was twelve.The family lived in Dresden and Vienna, where Dehnius developed a keen interest in mathematics, natural philosophy and astronomy, and was elected to the Vienna House of Commons in 1766. During his stay in Vienna he met and befriended Rudolf von Kirchhoff, Isaac Newton, Julius Evola, and other prominent philosophers. His name was eventually used by William Herschel to make his Comets of 1814 and 1815.  
 Dehnius received his B.S. ( 1769 ) in mathematics from University of Vienna and his M.D. ( 1774 ) from the University of Leipzig, where he was an assistant physician. In 1782 he was elected to the house of commons in Prussia, which replaced the lower chamber of the same name, which was largely controlled by Prussian nobility. He then took up residence in Leipzig. In Leipzig he conducted astronomical studies under his mentor Kirchhoff ( 1752–1829 ), and in 1787, published his first book, a work in progress in philosophy and astronomy, with an extra chapter on astronomy as applied to metallurgy. Von Dehnius soon became de facto inspector of the astronomy at Leipzig, and the city's annexation to the Prussian Republic, allowing him to take full and direct control of astronomy there, was the end of his political career. He retired from politics and returned to Leipzig.  
 Dehnius lived at Leipzig for the rest of his life, and his duties at Leipzig enabled him to learn what is known today as stellararithmetic, the study of eclipses and coronal transformations, beginning in the mid-1780s. During this time he also worked on the `` Leipzig Syndrome ''. This term is sometimes used to describe the night sky's oblateness. He also did calculations using equations, such as the Fourier series, which provided illumination in his book Ästhetische Begriff des Natur in der Physik.  
   
 Dehnius published all of his works in Leipzig, Berlin, Strasbourg, and Bonn. He died in Bonn, at the age of 69, during the second voyage of the world's first torpedo boat, the Fritz Plan, on 25 June 1805. A crater on the Moon is named after him.

Adolf Martin Gropp ( 15 March 1847 – 13 March 1936 ) was a German astronomer.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Adolf Martin Gropp was the son of Karl Gropp, a lawyer, and Charlotte Gauthier-Curie. He was trained as an astronomer.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Gropp studied medicine in Freiberg, Baden, and Berlin. During World War I, he was stationed in Stettin as an engineer. He spent a year in Paris as a soldier for a non-commissioned officer in an artillery regiment. In 1917 he was promoted to a civilian position as a medical aide to a chaplain in a hospital. From 1920 to 1930, he was an assistant professor at the University of Berlin.In 1937, Gropp and his co-author Heinrich Schmidt accepted an invitation to spend an extended stay in the United States at the offices of the American Optical Society. While there, Gropp was appointed head of the Department of Astronomical Research at the University of Chicago. The following year, the University of Chicago was transformed into the University of Chicago, where Gropp would hold the position of professor until his death.  
   
   
 == University of Chicago ==  
 In 1933, Gropp returned to the University of Chicago, where he was named professor of astronomy and professor of mathematics. He initially held the position of associate professor, but resigned as interim chairman of the astronomy department following the elevation of Helmut Schmidt to full professor in 1935. After Schmidt's retirement, he became chancellor in 1938 and remained in that post until his death in 1936. At the time of his death, Gropp was chairman of the Los Alamos Laboratory ( now the Los Alamos National Laboratory ) and chair of the committee that approved the experimental high-energy uranium bomb project. In 1955, he was one of the three persons selected to head the Indiana National Primate Research Laboratory. During the period 1939–1942, he was also an associate professor of experimental physics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

August Theodore Dillman ( September 14, 1882, Easton, Pennsylvania – July 25, 1968, Penn ) was a Methodist and pastor of the Unitarian church in Heavelton, Pennsylvania.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Dillman was born on September 14, 1882, the eldest of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. He came to Unitarianism at an early age and attended a local Unitarian church.  
   
   
 == Service ==  
 In 1893, Dillman graduated from Wesleyan University with an A.B. degree. He studied Bible and Jewish Studies at the University of Pennsylvania from 1893 to 1897, where he studied under Joseph Piaget. Dillman held his theological clerkship there from 1897 to 1903. Dillman was ordained a Wesleyan minister on October 25, 1903, and served as his secretary from 1901 to 1904.Dillman's love of the Unitarian church made him develop what is today called the Church Worship Movement. In 1905, he founded the Unitarian Church in West Philadelphia, which spread to mostly lower income areas in Philadelphia and surrounding areas. Dillman was soon transferred to the United Methodist Church in Untytown, where he became the church's Vice President and General Manager from 1910 to 1914. Dillman's commitment to his church inspired him to turn Unitarianism into a significant religion. He started to preach in Union Station and organized church meetings in Union Station. He served as Dean of the Graduate School from 1919 to 1924.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 In 1934, Dillman lost his religious beliefs, and decided to take up a job as an accountant. While doing clerical work for the United States Postal Service, Dillman met his future wife, Erma, in Philadelphia, and married her on April 10, 1938. The New York Times described Dillman's life as `` as giddy as any party in America. The young couple had been married only a few months, and he had never known her to sleep or eat. '' Her father, a wealthy businessman, considered the marriage premature because his demands `` ran counter to her taste and her health. '' Dillman was once back in his native Pennsylvania working at the Morgan Motor Works in Yorktown.  
 Dillman died in Heavelton on July 25, 1968, from pneumonia.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Dillman authored books on Baptismal History, Human Relations, Family Reunion, The Resurrection and Regeneration, and Orthodoxy. His book The Restoration of Christianity ( 1911 ) published two years before the Academy of Wesley published its Geschichte des Christentums Werke. Dillman contributed to denominational journals throughout his ministry, including Unitarian Review, New York Unitarian, and Unitarian Theological Review. Among his books were The Faith That Jesus Christ Revealed and What is A Christian God? ( 1914 ) and The Role of God in the Church.

 = Franz Paulowitz =  
Franz Paulowitz ( or Paulov ; Russian : Петр Васи́нович Нау́вов ; 19 August 1890 – 19 July 1971 ) was a German philosopher who was active in Germany during World War II. In 1935, he became professor of philosophy at the University of Rostock. In 1951, he was awarded the Prix e du Duc d'Urville. He was best known for his work on Ethics and the System of Morals.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Paulowitz was born on 19 August 1890 in Poznań, Poland. He studied philosophy and philology in the Freiberg Polytechnic in Braunschweig and was later ordained as a priest. He then studied logic at the universities of Berlin, Strasbourg, and Zürich. He became a civil servant at the Ministry of Justice in Strasbourg where he worked as a lawyer until 1919, when he took a position at the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in Leipzig as a lecturer in theoretical physics and on quantum physics. He became director of the Physikalisch-synthesische Akademie der Wissenschaften ( Physical Society of Science ) in Leipzig in 1919, taking the title of director on 29 July 1923, and serving until his retirement in 1959.  
   
   
 == Ideology ==  
 At this time, Paulowitz was primarily concerned with the problems of Kant and post-Kantianism, which were controversial. Kant was regarded by some as the founder of the modern philosophy of knowledge, however Paulowitz questioned the implications of his ideas. Karl Barth explicitly criticized Kant's position in regard to Truth, arguing in his Critical Foundations of Metaphysics ( 1871 ) that the essential difference between the transcendent and the specific is that the former concerns Absolute Truth, while the latter concerns the lack of experience and subjectivity in common conceptions of objects. Paulowitz, on the other hand, stated that the latter thought everything capable of being known is accessible to experience in the intellect and the will.  
   
   
 == Paulov and truth ==  
 Paulowitz was a proponent of Paul Cohen's theory of knowledge. This idea arose from his initial writing on mathematics and ontology, in which he argued that the objects of mathematical theory correspond to the generalizations of the theories of mind. He also believed the logical structure of thought, of which logic is a part, to be able to contain truth.In his Critique of Pure Reason ( 1898 ) Paulowitz formulated a `` Deontological Critique of Reason '' that holds that reason is really a philosophical exercise and that it has the intention to make the world better than it is. This philosophical approach to the investigation of truth, in which he explicitly draws on Carnap's ontological argument, develops his philosophy of ethics and moral theory, and in which he presents his own position in the developing and broad conception of moral realism.

Max Abbilder ( 16 May 1908 – 30 November 2001 ) was a German mathematician.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Max Abbilder was born in Harz ; he was a cousin of the alchemist Aleksander Abbilder. He completed his habilitation in mathematics at the University of Berlin in 1928, studied abroad at Breslau and Cambridge, and became a naturalized citizen in 1932. His Habilitation dissertation was the `` De facto Operationia cognitus '' of Arno Moritz Heyrick, and the relationship between ideas and action : `` The relation between ideas and action depends upon a condition of imperfect causality ( identical ). ''  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Several of his fundamental works are published. The completeness theorem of Lie algebra was formalized in Abbilder's Habilitation dissertation. An important textbook of algebraic logic is Léon Steiner's Teil I-IV. From 1933 to 1941, his re-ordering theorem is a basis for Steiner's theory of finite groups. It has been described by Stephen Metcalfe as an `` immense breakthrough '' for working with finite groups, but is now largely ignored. With J. David Luce, E. P. Blyth, and Murray Papachristos, he was the first to formalize some notion of independence between algebraic operators. Also in 1933, he formalized the abstract countability of Lie algebras. He married Marie Berti and together they had three children, Wolfgang, Margit, and Pietro. In 1936, he founded and headed the Mathematical Institute of the University of Berne, which is now known as the Max Abbilder Institute of the Franck Universität Leopoldina. In 1947, the Institute of Linear Algebra was founded in Berlin to spread Max Abbilder's ideas. It is one of the world's leading centers of research in linear algebra.  
   
   
 == Recognition ==  
 In 1949, an archive from Abbilder's residence and other collections in Berlin were given the Max Abbilder Institute's academic title, Max Abbilder & Co. The institute and library are open to the public, and include copies of works and drawings that Abbilder wrote for and directed.

Louis Arnauld de Candagno ( French : [ ɑlāʁn bə. ] ; 30 May 1742 – 14 March 1809 ) was a Belgian geographer.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Louis Arnauld de Candagno was born in Saint-François-de-Aube, in the Duchy of Deventer and graduated in 1777. He was physician to the Duke of Buccleuch, the general of the Hussite army, who was an opponent of the Huguenots and the Napoleonic Wars. During the French Revolution he was interned in a storehouse in Benoît-sur-Seine, but was permitted to return to Brussels in 1789.  
 He came to Brussels in 1796, in the employ of his father-in-law and Charles-Joseph Giraud ( 1711–1786 ). He was admitted as an Assistant Geographer in 1798. In the same year, he travelled to Russia as Deputy State Geographer in the Ottoman Empire.  
 In 1803 he was named Geographer to the Romanov government, which had assembled in Kiev in 1801.  
 Candagno published a work of monumental and historical character ( Histoire géographique des moscoms des Cordeliers de Jean-Baptiste Louis de Candagno ), which had eluded translation at that time, until Francoise Julien Bretter's edition was published in 1911. His contributions to the geography of France ( 1794–1805 ) and Britain ( 1805–1811 ) had opened up a new field in geographical research, the study of the global distribution of nations and their people. In this connection he was the first to find that the British Isles stood on the `` southern end '' of the distribution range of the British Isles.  
 The geographer Jean-Pierre Loïc Beaucaigne called him `` the father of geographers '', and thus the first of them. On the other hand, French academic historians Pierre-Sébastien Savard, Drouet Bursard, Franck Dufour, Florian Canton, and a small number of French officers considered him a great amateur who should be taken for a moron when elected to the Geographical Society of London.  
 Candagno appears to have wished to go to Switzerland to work for some partner or publisher of his large and important Histoire géographique. In 1802 he took his post in Palermo and at the time of his death in London in 1809, by then in great financial difficulties, he was still holding the post as a professor of geography at the Royal College of Physicians in London.

 = Dirk Hasselblad =  
Dirk Frits Hasselblad ( July 9, 1922 in Busingen – August 8, 1996 in Ramstein ) was a Dutch physicist. He was a co-discoverer of neutron scattering, and has earned the reputation of being a renowned leader of the field of quantum electronics, due to the Reionization of low-energy nuclear interactions using nuclear reactions and very low energy thermal currents. He was also a pioneer in Quantum Electrodynamics and related fields of quantum mechanical physics and devices for quantum mechanics.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
   
 Dirk Hasselblad was born on July 9, 1922 in Busingen. He had a brother who was also a physicist. He began his undergraduate studies at the Technische Hochschule Düsseldorf, after which he continued his medical studies at the University of Rostock, studying under Ludwig Boltzmann. He completed his doctorate in 1934, and was appointed an associate professor at the University of Giessen. During this time he began applying himself to research into photon optics, switching from nuclear to nuclear physics. He also performed pioneering work in quantum electrodynamics ( QED ).  
 In 1947, after working for ten years as a particle physicist, Hasselblad became a professor at the University of Marburg. In 1952 he was appointed professor of theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. In 1967 he was appointed director of the SPIE and technical services for the National Research Council. He also served as President of the Dutch Society of Physics in 1972.  
 In 1977, Hasselblad, along with Ole Johansen and Robert Waayck, established the Quantum Electrodynamics Research Group at the Institute for Quantum Optics ( SIMO ) in Eindhoven. With the support of architect Margarethe Oppenheim and Niels Bohr, the group developed the groundwork for the manufacture of quantum dot devices, creating the opportunity to develop new kinds of atomic transitions. Also in 1977, at the university's photonics center, the team developed a new type of glass crystal used in quantum dots, specifically for electron imaging, a specialised field in which the nature of ions induced the transitions to become possible. This work also furthered studies involving superposition and photoionization.  
 In 1992, Hasselblad was awarded the Ernest Weyl Prize.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
   
 Dirk Hasselblad married Zoë Kupermann in 1954. She was a physics lecturer in the University of Leiden, but his job gave him the right to buy her a house. As well as his wife, they had two children : Niki van de Sande and Anna-Maria Doenzer. Dirk Hasselblad died in his sleep on August 8, 1996, at the age of 69.

 = Paul Ehrlich =  
Paul August Ehrlich ( 23 April 1858 – 18 April 1939 ) was a German scientist and a lifelong proponent of the Bible.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
 Paul Ehrlich was born in Köln. After studies in Berlin, he started to work in an experimental brewery in 1882. In 1893, he travelled to Scandinavia and in 1894 he studied at the University of Copenhagen under Olaf Kolbe. In 1907 he travelled again to Denmark and in 1908 he completed his doctoral dissertation, The Plant Act as a Creator, which contains more detailed findings on the significance of the Christian message in the development of the environment.  
 In 1911, Ehrlich started his career as a microbiologist, working in the Microbiological Laboratory of the University of Copenhagen. He was hired by the State Organic Bureau, and in 1917 he succeeded Olaf Kolbe in the position of entomologist in the East, serving as director of the Bárðarbunga till Män ( Botanical Institute ) in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 1922, he moved to Zurich, and in 1928, he was transferred to the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences of the German Reich, which functioned as a successor to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Soziologie. Ehrlich specialized in the identification of the hereditary genetic material in plants and their function. In a general theory of plant origin, this was due to the incomplete genetic material that could not be inherited. Ehrlich's ultimate goal was the recognition of the historical origin of plants. He is credited with laying the groundwork of plant philosophy.  
 In 1934 Ehrlich and Karl Leiden  
 graduated from the newly founded University of Zurich with Ehrlich as the only one recognized as an authority. He worked as a lecturer at the University of Zurich and his pupils at the Kiel Agricultural Institute, the University of Jena, and the University of Darmstadt.  
 Ehrlich was at the forefront of many scientific publications concerning plant biology, he received numerous awards and from 1948 was awarded the Albert Einstein Award for his `` Excellence in Physical Chemistry ''.In 1906, Ehrlich published his first book on phytochemistry, Sapodinella Ehrlichii ( American Phycological Association ), a collection of the biochemistry of plants ( Agaricus species Ehrlichii ). Ehrlich's book was translated into seven languages and included more than 400 scientific papers, some 60 articles in over 40 publications. One of his books, `` The Origin of Bacteria in Plants, '' was awarded the Linnean Society of London Medal in 1919. In 1923, Ehrlich published a book entitled Johann Friedrich von Beringer's Illuminating Handbook of Plant Physiology, in which he went into detail on phytochemistry.In 1930, Ehrlich accepted the Chair of Agronomy at the University of Zurich. In 1938, after the World War II broke out, Ehrlich accepted the Chair of Plant Physiology at the University of Zürich, in 1940 he retired and returned to Germany, dying in Zurich on 18 April 1939.

 = Henriette Alberti =  
Henriette Alberti ( 3 May 1870, France – 4 May 1940, Maine ) was an American physician and academic. She was the first woman to receive an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University and the first woman to receive a PhD from Brown University.  
   
   
 == Education and early career ==  
 Alberti was born Henriette Marie Chevreul in Paris, France, to Henriette Albert and Philippe Alberti.  
 Alberti went to the University of Paris in 1885 to receive her Ph.D.. in medicine, with her thesis being titled `` On the Prevention of Dry Oedema and Flushing ''. Alberti was the first woman to receive a degree in medicine in France at that time, and the first woman to receive a doctorate from a U.S. medical school. Alberti also received a BA and MA from the University of Paris.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === As a physician ===  
 Alberti worked at the Women's Hospital in Nantes, and was a surgeon in her hometown of Lyon.Alberti developed a passion for medicine after her son was killed in a car crash in 1888.In 1900, she moved to England, where she took a job as an assistant physician at Wakefield Hospital in Liverpool. She spent two years in the position, and moved to Ireland in 1902. There, she learned to practice medicine, and taught English at Queen's College, Belfast. She also held a post as a member of the surgical staff at Temple Mead Hospital in Derry.Alberti relocated to Montreal, Quebec, where she taught at University of Montreal from 1902 to 1904. In 1904, she married Dr. Harry Albert, who had taught anatomy at Yale University.Alberti was the first woman to earn an honorary doctorate in medicine. In 1905, she became a faculty member at Yale University, a position she held until her retirement in 1913.  
   
   
 === As a researcher ===  
 In 1916, Alberti went on a five-year observational study of nursing homes in the United States. While studying nurseries, she discovered the surprising practice of hiring only women as residents. Alberti was the first to question the prevailing belief in nursing as a male-dominated profession.She examined 167 nursing homes, searching for correlations between socioeconomic status and the state of health of its residents. She found a link between mortality rates and changes in access to health care, with a correlation between increases in hospital mortality and expenditures for their care.Alberti ran a study of hospitals in the U.S. from 1914 to 1917, comparing the health of the nursing population with that of the general population.While studying nursing homes in Montreal, she and her husband both developed a social interaction theory. They had just returned from a trip to an English-speaking country. Alberti did not recognize their happiness and resigned in 1918. She was described as modest in personality. The man she was married to continued to work and care for her as a supporting spouse.  
 Alberti received a fellowship from the Carnegie Institute in 1921 and received the lifetime appointment at Duke University in 1924, teaching until her death.Alberti died at her home in Clifton, Maine, aged 82, on 4 May 1940.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 Alberti was an honorary doctoral candidate in her field from Brown University in 1915 and the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Duke University in 1921. In 1929, she received an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard University.  
   
   
 === Scientific legacy ===  
 In 1970, Alberti was recognized as the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate in medical science, and the first woman to receive a PhD from Brown University.

 = Axel Fischman =  
Axel Fischman ( 1 January 1755 – 20 November 1848 ) was a German naturalist, botanist, zoologist, archaeologist and writer. He contributed to numerous species of plants, especially fungi.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Fischman was born in Magdeburg to a Jewish family of artists. At the age of 15, he studied natural sciences, zoology and archaeology at the University of Erlangen.  
 He spent much time in France where he attended the museums of Paris and Versailles.After finishing his studies, he became an assistant to the botanist Friedrich Sittler at the Charles University of Berlin. As early as 1775 he made collections for Sittler and a list of thirty-nine species of plant species was submitted to him by Ferdinand August Blumenbach, a private collector. This list is today part of the Max Planck Botanical Garden.  
 While at Charles University in Berlin, Fischman founded the Society for the Protection of Natural History, which was the precursor of the Berlin Natural History Society, and then, after his return to Germany in 1783, the Botanical Garden.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Fischman's most significant work is a full-scale treatise on edible fungi ( 1787 ). In the process, he produced some of the first published descriptions of plants from the early Eocene era, including pansies, dwarf barks, dwarf rhizomes, and ovals. It is also notable for discovering Gyraceae ( a group of hybrid-plants ) and Phyllodendrone plants and for using the word stork as the generic name of all flowering plants.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 In 1815 he was admitted as a pensioner on account of his need to get some settled work done, so he died at Frankfurter Straße nr 88, Berlin.

Ferdinand Schwaepper ( 12 March 1728 – 16 October 1847 ) was a German mathematician, chemist, and pharmacist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Zuwei, in Württemberg. He was the son of the mathematician Friedrich Ehrlich, a professor at Göttingen. In 1764 he went to the University of Berlin to study mathematics and physics under Heinrich Friedrich Schultze ( 1716–1780 ). In 1771, he studied medicine, and after a long medical journey in the island of Täbberg ( near Lake Constance ), went to Freiburg University where he received his PhD in 1776. He then went to Cambridge where he began to conduct experimental and clinical studies of the effects of various drugs, which was important for understanding the biochemical and nervous systems of the body. From 1780 until his death in 1847, Schwaepper was the corresponding laboratory director of the Walter Benjamin Laboratory in London.  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 Schwaepper's first published paper dealt with the effects of emethetic drugs such as morphine, but his concentration and transparency is less known. He discovered first that the synthesis of the drugs under physiological conditions of respiration became possible, producing bright red urine ( Schimmelhundenzymbol ) after one hour of cessation, and after twenty hours `` the presence of morphine in the urine makes us glad and even giddy '' ( Schimmelhundenzymbol ). Schwaepper also gave some empirical evidence that in humans and animals the nervous system appears to be on a level with that of a living organism.

 Dicken was born in Bygdjessen, Århus. He studied drawing at the Imperial University of Copenhagen and studied his father, Gustaf Dicken, a schoolteacher who was a pupil of Dussart. In 1860, when he was a 17-year-old junior art student, Gustaf Dicken took Dicken to Amsterdam for a trial session of his recently published comic novel Sketch & Line. They stayed in Amsterdam until the summer and lived in the city for the next several years. Around the time he left to work for Gustaf Dicken, Dicken's father died. Dicken never joined his father's work and eventually later joined his father's foragers. He was employed by Dussart for six years before he began to pursue his professional career.Dicken served as his father's assistant at the Royal Danish School of Arts and Crafts from 1879 to 1881. In 1883, Dicken's father was awarded the title `` student painter '' for his composition and illustration. Dicken was much admired in Denmark and abroad for his character designs, illustrations, and in-art books. Dicken held a succession of artistic positions as well as a chief municipal commission for a project. He also became a member of the University of Copenhagen in 1884.  
 In 1889, Dicken married Ursula Skovbo, the daughter of Bernhard Skovbo, in Utøya. In 1895, Dicken and Ursula bought the apartment that had been the living quarters of his father-in-law. During World War I, his house was used by the Danish National Guard to house wounded soldiers. From 1890 to 1894, Dicken owned two hotels in Copenhagen and has a gallery of his artwork in the Town Hall.  
 Dicken was a professor of painting at the Royal Danish School of Arts and Crafts from 1892 to 1904 and was elected a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892. In 1904, Dicken traveled to New York, where he and his wife emigrated to. From 1904 to 1916, Dicken published articles on cartoons in Gjenno Teddemann's Paintings of Paris, and they were successful both as illustrations and as book covers.

George Gunnison ( November 2, 1862 – June 22, 1955 ) was an American composer and music educator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Gunnison's musical education started early. After graduating from Roosevelt High School in 1882, he continued music in law school. After graduation in 1893, Gunnison studied music composition with J. A. Adler and became a music tutor and instructor at the Institute of Music in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1900, Gunnison taught at the Music Institute of the University of Pittsburgh, where he became professor of music composition in 1909. At Pittsburgh, Gunnison became a member of the Pittsburgh Composers Union, founded by Gustav Mahler, Alexander de Tocqueville and George A. Broderick.  
 In 1910, Gunnison moved to New York City where he became professor of music composition at the City College of New York. In 1921 he was named associate professor at Rutgers University and director of its Institute of Music. In 1927, Gunnison moved to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he remained until his death.  
 Gunnison was a proponent of experimental music, usually in concert settings, and exhibited an intense dislike of the traditional approach of Classical music. The ideas in concert were often antithetical to the ways of writing music in his day. He used acoustic instruments like electric guitars and saxophone, but presented them through vaudeville style and his own specially crafted orchestral pieces, a technique that did not at the time have widely adopted acceptance and popularity.  
 Gunnison was a member of the Western Music Association, the American Society of Composers and Authors and the American Association of University Professors, and also served as chairman of the music composition committee for the recently formed New York Conservatory of Music.

 Coucin was also an avid naturalist and proponent of organic agriculture. He led several trips to the Brittany region in order to study for the Biblical books of Chronicles and Proverbs. This activity, and his long association with the Sieur de Castelnau's re-development of the natural history collections of the Gouvernement de la Cours Dunkerque ( Cour de Rome ), helped bring Napoleon Bonaparte into the field, and enabled him to collect some of the native plants which he had never seen before in the French colonies.  
   
   
 == Taxonomy ==  
 His work has been criticized as `` unbiblical '' due to the presence of characters whose antiquity is scientifically unknown.  
 For example, the words brevirostris, breviary, means `` the tree that grows on a green vine, '' and is indicative of a plant not specifically described as a citrus. Another example is `` perspic-fructification : to produce a plant so its roots or shoots are firmly rooted, without which it would not thrive ''. Plants grow well in temperatures of +40 °C.

Johann Heinrich Marconi ( 9 February 1853 in Bonn – 14 July 1938 in Basel ) was a Swiss astronomer, meteorologist, and inventor.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Marconi was born on 9 February 1853 in the home town of the original patriarch of Basel, Andreas Gesellert Marconi. He was the son of Johann Heinrich Marconi, who used to own the property now known as F1. J.H. Marconi was a painter and photographer, and his mother, Maria Fertitta, also a photographer. After completing his primary and secondary school education, he started his career as a horoscope artist, along with several other collaborators, including Peter Gabriel.  
   
   
 == Scientific development and inventions ==  
 He was involved with the electrical origin of magnetism. He began a new branch of physics, plasma physics, with the help of Carlo Carlo Berlof. He also developed the method of using an `` index '' to determine the various axial accelerations as found in some magnetists'theories.His name is often credited with the device that connects the Earth's magnetosphere with the electromagnetic source, in the form of an electric field – the `` Marconi field ''. Marconi made use of this device, known as a `` magnetometer '', at the Wimpole-Nauvais Observatory, and a few other sites around the globe. During World War II, Marconi has been `` credited with almost 100 patents in aviation, submarines, missiles, radar, radar satellites and aircraft computers. He built models of many of these things including automatic reference-counting digital computers. He developed the German-made.Marconi Signal Technology Institute with the help of German research institutes in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. From 1949 to 1962 he served as director of the Wimpole-Nauvais Observatory. After World War II, he was a member of the United Nations Scientific Committee for the Arts ( 1966-1968 ). Marconi's Theoretical Theory of the Earth was published in 1960. As of 2004, Marconi's name is also associated with a solid state gas turbine with the logo M. Marconi, and he was a consultant to Shell and Mitsubishi Corporation ( ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Marconi had three children, Franziska, Sophia and Jerzy. Although he only married Sophia in 1885, her biographer thought she was of similar birth rate to that of his son Franz. She became a classical pianist, excelling in the Beethoven period and, having a doctorate in music from the University of Basel in 1893, the piano was discovered in her room by Theodor Johann Adolph Fischer ( 1831–1913 ) and is said to be kept in his house.He died on 14 July 1938 in Basel. He was buried at the Danzig-Friedrich Wilhelm Cemetery.In his name, Marconi was the first owner of the Marconi couplet `` ENTRESS — DELICIOUS '' on a copy of his 1936 work The Universe of Waves, which has sold 250,000 copies since its first publication.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Marconi was a prolific inventor. His earliest invention was the electric arc fuse. His company, Marconi Electric Scientific Laboratories ( MESL ), was established in 1895. After several sales of these devices to various astronomical observatories, Marconi patented his magnetometer. His explanation for the invention was that his daydreams were inspiration to his father, who had invented a similar device.At the time of his death, Marconi had six patents filed in Switzerland, all regarding electrical devices.

 Boris Jergerovich Ekimov was born in Red-Donets. His father, a prominent merchant, died when he was six years old. Ekimov attended the State Conservatory in Moscow and graduated from Moscow State University in 1881. While studying at the University of Dorpat he became convinced that evolution could be explained by Natural Selection. For Ekimov, such `` biological competition '' – natural selection – for various individuals within an organism was not the most natural means of evolution. From 1887 he taught biology at the Leningrad State University. He later received the doctoral degree in 1886 and was granted teaching positions in Moscow University, Imperial University of Odessa and Moscow State University.

 During his time at Odessa, Ekimov published a series of books, mostly on physiology and zoology. He was member of the National Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He served as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 1902 to 1906 and the First Secretariat of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1906 to 1906. He was involved in the outbreak of the Second Balkan War of 1905. He also became the president of the Association for the Study of the Phylloxera and Phytozoa ( Astrophysics ) in 1910.  
 Ekimov had his doctoral dissertation on Drosophila venom glands and his more famous textbook on parasitology. As well as teaching, he was a member of the first Congress of scientific societies of the USSR, held in Berlin in 1912.Ekimov's main work on evolution is Anatomy and Physiology of Birds and Turtles ( 1932 ). The last book published by him was published in 1942. His topic was `` Contribution of Animals to the History of Life. ''

 = Bettina Bockstetter =  
Bettina Louise Bockstetter ( August 29, 1915 – September 7, 1999 ) was an American microevolutionist, immunologist and culturist who wrote about bacterial hybridization and bacterial toxin theory in the 1970s. She is best known as the co-author, with Stewart Stevens, of the classic book on hybridization known as The Science of Hybridization : Its Origin and Meaning, First Ed., with Stewart Stevens, Ed. In 1971, she was awarded the National Medal of Science. She received the Kennedy Research Fellow medal from the United States Department of Agriculture.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bettina Louise Bockstetter was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1915. Her mother was a classical pianist with an innovative stage presence.  
 She completed a mathematics degree from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1941 and earned her Master's degree in 1941. In 1943 she married Timothy Bessell, a computer scientist, who helped her work as a computer programmer in mathematics. She then taught for a year as a professor at The University of Texas at Austin. Her research interests focused on the interaction of bacteria and DNA in the development of microbial cell lines. In 1955 she moved to the United States to live with her mother. As a result of her scholarly work in genetics and microevolution, she was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1967.  
 After her doctorate she served for a time in the Pacific Ocean under special intelligence assessments. She then began working for the Pentagon on behalf of the United States government as a scientific consultant on nuclear weapons research. She also was a paid consultant for the defense computer company Kernware, where she helped construct the “ Budweiser commercial ” beer system and also worked on developing a virus scanner called the codelink that could speed up analysis of smallpox viruses.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After the war, Bockstetter returned to Texas to work for the Texas Department of State Health Services ( now Texas State Hospital ), where she began studying bacteriophage viruses. She became a visiting scholar at MIT and received her Ph.D. in biology in 1976 from the University of Chicago. She and Steven Stevens continued their research of bacterial hybridization. She published The Science of Hybridization with Stewart Stevens in 1971. Her husband died in 1984. Bettina Bockstetter died in 1999 at her home in Amarillo, Texas.  
 The topic of her pioneering work was the origin and significance of bacterial diversity, which in Bockstetter ’ s study was the leading theme of all her work. The new research, with evolutionary biologists Kenneth Miller and John O'Donoghue, explored the role of gene dynamics in the self-organization of genetic materials in bacterial multicellular organisms. Bockstetter presented her own theory of the origin of the complex of bacterial species in 1988. In the study's final chapter, entitled “ The Evidence for Water, ” she concluded that many microbial communities are involved in the production of certain key nutrients and the passage of viruses.  
 Her best-known work was The Nature of Life with Stewart Stevens, who she had worked with since 1963. According to Bettina Bockstetter, her major role in bringing her husband Stewart into the subject of hybridization was to educate him about biology, specifically, the relationship between microbiomes and pathogenesis. They argued for the establishment of a clinical laboratory in Europe for microbiology and genetics researchers, and were awarded a Fellowship.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 In 1971, Bockstetter co-authored The Science of Hybridization with Stewart Stevens with Stewart Stevens, Ed. In 1971 she received the National Medal of Science. She and Stevens continued to study hybridization in the late 1960s, which brought them together again in a coauthored book The History of Hybridization ( 1974 ). She published later that year, the first instalment in the series of nine that served as two eponymous books. The third and final book in the series of three, Simpler and Sparser Species, was published in 1978. It ran to twenty volumes, edited by Barbara Allen, Stephen S. Bernard, and Barbara Callender.She wrote a personal testimony on the origin of the fusarium.

 = George Knight =  
George James Knight ( 1839–1926 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Coleoptera and Diptera. He was of Hungarian-German descent.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Knight was born in Norwich, in 1839, the son of Joshua Knight of Pitton and Margaret Knudsen. He was educated at the Norwich City School and graduated B.A. in 1847. His mother died in 1852, leaving him to the care of his uncle George, a banker, who raised the family. One of his three brothers, Robert, was also taught by his father and, after the family were in debt, George gave him a sizable inheritance.Knight was apprenticed in mining at Devilpay in Cumberland and later in Bristol. He published his observations of the minute fly and his studies on Coleoptera in his 1859-1860 Butterflies of Britain and Ireland ( Bousset & Allen, 1861 ). Knight's attention was drawn to the Coleoptera in this work, however, and he formed the idea of forming a Special Fund to improve the knowledge of Coleoptera in England. Knight wrote to D.M. Dibbs requesting a hand, as the English dearth of illustrators had left few good specimens. Dibbs generously agreed to assist in constructing the Coleoptera in The Quarterly Entomologist and Sceptical Entomologist in 1862, but Knight's enormous advance in illustrating the Coleoptera was unenthusiastic. In 1866, Knight was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society. His report, `` The Coleoptera of Wales '' was later published as The Coleoptera of Wales. In 1869, he sent, with Charles Edwards, the insects in the Encyclopædia Britannica to Frederick William Harvey's Trans. Entomol. ( 2nd ser. ) Series on the family Coleoptera, including Latimeria, Lycipsidae, Xenopus.  
 Knight died at Donnington, Essex, on 11 February 1926.

 = Jacques Creer =  
Jacques Creer ( 24 November 1845 – 26 April 1912 ) was a French entomologist who specialised in insects, especially the mosquitoes.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jacques Creer was born at Carcassonne. He began his career as an assistant and later a chief gardener, and devoted himself mainly to the study of mosquitoes. As a result, in 1875 he wrote an article on subspecies of ant, Liolaemus crescorum, of South Africa. In 1886 he became a junior entomologist. In 1891 he published the results of an investigation, undertaken in conjunction with his colleague, Dr. Van Schryver, and in the course of which the three of them collected in the Hausend – Sur-Vincent region of Southern Africa an abundance of mosquitoes. The articles, collected during the years 1894–1895, became a regular appendix in The Entomologist, and were occasionally reproduced in local journals.Upon his return to France in 1897 he started work on an introduction to zoology which appeared in four parts in 1902, and another in 1905. In 1905 he was the author of a lengthy article on Liolaemus ( Liolaemus crescorum ), which appeared in the Gazette de la Société d'Etude géographique, and in 1908 in the Bulletin des Minéralogie, ou, Mémoire sur la Société Géologique des Animaux, and in 1910, together with other authors, the volume on Liolaemus ( Liolaemus crescorum ) which appeared in the Journal des Sciences Naturelles, and also in the Bulletin d'Entomologie Universelle.

 Creer developed a theory of the inheritance of character which at one time was accepted by the majority of researchers in entomology. This idea was that a person becomes chaste ( mère chaleur ) when he or she is exposed to the intensity of the mosquito-borne disease, regardless of any hormonal or other factors affecting the body. However, in 1910, Creer and his colleagues presented, at the 60th International Congress on Parasites, the case of a hunter, surnamed Creer ( Norwegian : Cresco ), who was reported to have had a lifelong relationship with a parrot female, Romée Jean Melchior, after her death from cholera. They ruled out that jealousy was at work and concluded that Creer was simply being `` hard on '' her. This later became known as the Creer case. However, the veracity of this case was questioned, and, in fact, the material that resulted from this investigation did not support Creer's hypothesis of the origin of character ; instead, it pointed to local personal relationships to be the factor in character formation.Of note, Creer also conducted an investigation which involved observations in a part of North Africa, in partnership with Eugène Royer, and which led to the establishment of two families ( Malipenes ) in Asia and South America.  
 His most important scientific contribution was the development of a theory of the transmission of tsetse flies to other insects, which eventually led to the research of tropical diseases, particularly dengue fever.Creer was an apothecary.
