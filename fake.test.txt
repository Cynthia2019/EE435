 = Clifford Hendrick =  
Clifford Hendrick, CBE, FRS, FOSE, LLM, FCSE, FSN, FGS, FODB, FSA ( 12 November 1868 – 19 October 1943 ) was a Scottish geologist, entomologist, biologist and zoologist. He was the first curator of the Girton Museum at Harrow and later of the Geological Society of London.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Hendrick was born in Kirkby, in 1868, into a family of musicians. His father, Henry Lewis Hendrick, was a music teacher. He studied composition and music in Glasgow and at the Musica Mathematica College in Edinburgh where he studied under Charles Bain, with whom he was lifelong friends. In 1876 he became first in his class to obtain a first class in music. He then returned to Scotland to attend the Conservatorium of Music in Lisburn, where his father continued to instruct students. He then enrolled at the University of Glasgow, where he was influenced by the experimental and the thinking of Percy Bysshe Shelley and the St. John of the Cross School of Scots, which pioneered the teaching of classical music.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The biographer John Grey, who knew Hendrick and his family well, recollects : `` That Hendrick had a distinctive voice was recognised long before the word ever filtered out of his lips. His syllables [ were ] pitch sensitive, and his phrasing would suggest one pitch of the way to distinguish between the words of musical thought. Even at this early stage, he understood what Shelley, in his two earliest plays, meant by that word 'heart'''.Initially he was taught by Lewis MacFarlane. In 1911 Hendrick took a university course in classical singing ( at that time called horn singing ) under George Taylor and was an expert horn-singing student, until being offered an invitation to join the Girton Museum, the University of London's geological research unit. Although he was not a great amateur horn player, he acquired the skills needed for the task. He trained in the field under Dr. Charles Bain in the summers of 1906 and 1909. At Girton Hendrick was first to build a life-size model of Sir Thomas Herriot's geological epigraph for his son, the geologist James Herriot. The grave marker at Girton also reads `` L.H. Dreyfuss ''.  
   
 In 1912 Hendrick became the curator of the Geological Society of London. He was also active in the `` Corps for the Protection of Mammals and Birds '', the Public Advisory Council for the Forest Reserve, and was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London in 1910.Hendrick retired from the Geological Society in 1915, having made an `` earnest effort to give to science the basic measures of science as a distinct science ''. In 1917 Hendrick returned to Girton, where he continued to work in the museum until his retirement in 1920. He taught zoology to the boys at Girton. He served on the Geological Society's committee on Entomology in 1932-1935 and on the Geological Research Committee in 1937-1940. Hendrick lived for a time at Mount Head, a popular recreation.  
 Hendrick and his wife Clara moved to the English countryside in 1919 and lived at Irmin Nambour in Athlone, where he dedicated his life to the protection of public birds. In 1937 his work was recognised by the Wildlife Trust of Great Britain.He died at Girton, in his native Gartown, on 19 October 1943.

 = Oleksander Konstantinovich Preobrazhensky =  
Oleksandr Konstantinovich Preobrazhensky ( Russian : Николай Андре́й Андрович Новной, ; 20 October 1902 – 15 April 1987 ) was a Soviet geologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Preobrazhensky was born on 20 October 1902 in Besansky, Ukraine, into a family of prominent men in the banking industry. He attended Besansky Gymnasium ( Russian : Пергелогич Кунса ), where he was a student of Vladimir Sedevik. His father Eduard Preobrazhensky was the leading banker and an influential member of the Soviet elite. Another son, Oleg Preobrazhensky was also a leading figure in the banking industry, and, like his father, was a patriarch in the Besansky community. At Besansky, Oleksandr spent his early years getting a normal education. His second year he went to Besansky Polytechnic Institute to study philosophy. When Preobrazhensky graduated from Besansky, he chose to continue his education at an extremely elite departmental institution, the Department of Geology of the Department of Metallurgy. At that time, geology was a sub-specialty, which made it almost impossible to find an excellent candidate for that particular field. Moreover, there was a significant degree of skepticism among Western scientific societies. Even the relatively conservative American Geologist Robert Louis Stevenson had not accepted the accepted field of geology. Nonetheless, his experience and professional interests in the subject were quite well known within the U.S.A. As a result, Preobrazhensky was recommended to the director of the Metallurgy Department, Alexander N. Baker. In 1944, the Government of the Soviet Union gave Preobrazhensky the rank of Major General and promoted him to Major General. In 1945, he became a Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  
 Preobrazhensky left Besansky for Leningrad in 1949, just before the Soviet government was launched into full democracy. He arrived in Leningrad at the height of the summer Soviet working week, in the midst of the Great Patriotic War, and on a busy time-frame. Preobrazhensky had spent several months as a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister at the United Nations. During this period, he worked closely with the first Soviet Geologist of Geological Sciences, Alexander Landov. Through this foundation of knowledge, which lasted for a number of years, he produced several major contributions in the field of paleontology and stratigraphy. He was particularly known for his groundbreaking `` Geological Survey of the USSR '', which covered many areas of the Soviet geology. He was awarded a Presidential Commendation for his pioneering work. From 1950 until 1960 he was director of the Metallurgy Department of the State Geodetic Service. In 1959, the Geological Institute of the USSR awarded him the Royal Geographical Society's J.D. Benson Gold Medal, as it is considered to be the most prestigious academic award awarded by the U.S. Geological Survey.  
 From 1964 until his death in 1987, Preobrazhensky was the head of the Geological Survey of the USSR. He was one of the first representatives of geology in the United States. Between 1963 and 1972, he was the Director of the Geological Survey of the USSR. He was often seen lecturing in engineering and technology courses in the United States, and on various other occasions in Europe.He was also an important conservationist. The life-size figurine of Preobrazhensky was dedicated to the summer Labor Day commemorations. It was placed in the Plouform Museum of the Leningrad State University.

 == Biography ==  
 Foster was born in New York City, the only child of Alfred Foster, a dealer of naturalist jewelry, and Hattie ( Ahn ) Foster. Arthur graduated from Columbia University in 1902, and earned a master's degree from Yale in 1903.Foster took classes in natural history and science at Cornell University and Harvard University. During the course of his doctoral research, he employed the phenomenon of palaeontological periods, using fossil parts of invertebrates. He visited many British and American museums and gardens ; and described numerous unique invertebrate fossil animals. Foster was president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, from which he was expelled after they found out about his love for ichthyosaurs.After graduate studies in geology, he studied minerals, showing that there was more mineral content in claystone than in ice, forming the basis for his textbook, `` Plate Tectonics of North America '' ( 1910 ), in which he developed the theory of glacial and interglacial erosion. He also attempted to demonstrate the early development of fossils of prehistoric times, in his book `` The First Precambrian Vertebrates of North America '' ( 1916 ), and the revision of other authors, including Bernard Harms of Yale, Henry C. Gilbert of the Smithsonian Institution, and L. C. Murray of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Foster also led the construction of a paleontology school at Washington State University and was awarded the Clark Medal in 1921.

 = Marie Hanstock-Bartholomew =  
Marie Hanstock-Bartholomew ( July 15, 1782 – December 20, 1873 ) was a Canadian naturalist, ornithologist and entomologist.  
 She was born in Jackson, Ontario, Canada, and was educated in London and the United States, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1797 from the University of Toronto, her doctoral dissertation being a contribution to the zoology of mosquitoes. She later taught at many colleges in Ontario and was active in the Department of Zoology and Forest Products at the University of Toronto ( 1814–1818 ), the Hunterian Club in York, and the National Museum of Natural History ( 1822–1835 ).  
 Hanstock-Bartholomew has been described as a follower of natural history philologist Charles Darwin. In 1816 she undertook what became one of her most important voyages. On April 30, 1816 she made a fifty-mile sail from London to the shore of the Hudson River, while sailing from New York to Toronto and thence to Saint John. She collected everything on board, from the shells to the feathers, feathers to the birds, eggs to the babies. Her goal was to study the evolution of birds and they have since become recognised as the universal building blocks of birds and the basis of all subsequent taxonomy.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Hanstock-Bartholomew was born to William Hanstock and Maria Louise Loveland of Northwestern Ontario in the 1830s. The Hanstocks had just emigrated from Europe when she arrived in Canada, and there were probably eight children, the eldest seven born in London, North Wales. Her mother was active as a female choir teacher in the provincial school system. The eldest daughter, Martha Armitage, accompanied her parents for four years to study as a minister in the city of Sudbury, from 1835 to 1841. She was married in 1846, and afterward was a nun in the local Franciscan monastery. Her marriage was registered in the Province of Manitoba and was dissolved in 1854. She and her wife moved in with Louis, who died in 1845. The couple was buried in a Jewish cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.  
 After marrying Louis'sister Elizabeth, Marie was employed as an assistant to Lady Mary Thomson. She was appointed Curate of Upper Newmarket Church and spent the rest of her life in Newmarket. She was a pacifist, and from 1857 to 1860 spent summers in Newfoundland with her family. She left Newmarket for Moncton in 1866, and was probably there in 1869 when she married Professor Albert Melfi of B.C. and travelled to Niagara Falls, New York. She spent time with the Melfis, he a pioneer pioneer of Arctic entomology. In 1869 she became a teacher of natural history at Moncton University, and then from 1871 to 1875 taught at the Hunterian Club in York. She also took the time from summer vacations to travel with her husband to Canada and the Americas, researching the habits and diversity of North American birds, particularly the eastern Mississauga Macaw.  
 As a young woman, Hanstock-Bartholomew was educated and travelled with her husband, taking classes on insects and birds. She married in 1845. They settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where she remained for the rest of her life. By the late 1880s, Louis was emigrating, so that she was able to be near him. In 1904 she died at age 88, leaving a legacy of knowledge and a lifetime of field work.

 = Dominique Guillermin =  
Dominique Guillermin ( French : [ ʒɔluːn ] ; 3 June 1913 – 3 February 1996 ) was a French philologist, linguist, and the head of the German sub-group of the Evangelical Church in France.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Guillermin was born in Éville to a prominent politician, and is the second daughter of a military industrialist who eventually became mayor of Paris in the 1930s. At the time of her mother's death in the 1940s, she had nine children, including three sons. Guillermin was allowed to attend primary school in Paris, and it was during this period that she began her education as a literate girl in the city. By the age of 17 she had established herself as a professional linguist ; she became fluent in German, French, French-spoken languages, Malay and Arabic. She then studied natural sciences at the Sorbonne. While studying in Paris, she met and married Isidor Epstein, an academic. They had a daughter, Ann, and a son, Zygmunt, born in 1953.Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, as part of the postwar policy to prevent the rise of Nazi Germany, they moved to the United Kingdom where they emigrated to the United States in 1942. Guillermin's parents remarried in 1945.  
 Guillermin's first book, Le prononçant ( 1938 ), was an early attempt to develop a coherent academic style of Germanic and Near Eastern studies. With Epstein, she published Nordlandzeiten : Einführungen und seine Grammatik ( 1939 ), which was followed by the book Else : Tod über eine pathologie Gebiet ( 1940 ). She also edited a number of German language and cultural works, and wrote a short treatise on hieroglyphic writing for beginners.  
   
   
 == Move to the United States ==  
 Following her father's death in 1947, Guillermin decided to relocate to the United States and work as a research linguist and educational aide. She moved to California in 1949, with her husband, and later to New York in 1951.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 While in New York, Guillermin became interested in working on topics related to languages, the critical encyclopedias of which she became well-versed. At the time, linguists were forbidden from working in this area due to the Nazi takeover of Germany, and she wanted to do something for scholars concerned with the history of the Indo-European languages. She soon became assistant to Ronald Severs. She published several workbooks on the subject of the Romance languages and comparative linguistics, and in 1954 founded the journal Linguistica Linguae Gentium in honor of Severs. She was an editor at Pembroke College from 1959 to 1970, and a department chair from 1962 until 1974. She also served on the faculty of the Theology School of the University of Southern California. From 1969 to 1975 she was Vice Chancellor of the University of Southern California. She was also chairwoman of the Board of Trustees of the Jesuit Biblical Seminary in Los Angeles from 1974 to 1977.  
 Guillermin became the first woman to serve as a member of the Academy of New York City in 1965. She had served as a member of the Academy of Illinois, also in 1966, and as a president of the Sorbonne of Paris in 1974.  
   
   
 == Soviet occupation of France ==  
 During the winter of 1953-54, when she was studying in Russia, Guillermin and Epstein were forcibly occupied by the Soviet People's Army. As part of her academic studies, Guillermin was especially exposed to documents related to language and philosophy. Many of these were addressed to Russians around the world. Guillermin wanted to apply her background in literature, history, and linguistics to offer hope to the East German leaders in their struggle with the Nazis, but in March 1955 she was arrested for allegedly resisting Soviet authorities. She was incarcerated in Auschwitz, but released on parole in June, and then visited by fellow exile Günter Lukas in Switzerland. She taught English and French at the University of Louvain until she was arrested in Italy in October 1956. In early September 1957 she was indicted and charged with sabotage, vandalism, and conspiracy, and was sentenced to death. A week later she was hanged in a French prison.  
 Guillermin was survived by her husband and children.

 == Early life ==  
 She was the eldest of four children, and was educated in the Wellesley College, Cambridge, where she studied natural sciences. Crýnemoes's mother was the librarian Ferenc Mánszewski and her father was Leo Aharonian, a Freemason. Her early childhood led to her placing her interest in ethnology in a religiously agnostic school.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Crýnemoes devoted herself to ethnology during her secondary years at Cambridge, and became a regular contributor to the major trade papers. Her work focused mainly on Hungarian-speaking communities in Greece, particularly the Peoples of Judea. In particular, she noted the influence of Catholicism in Greek culture. She also participated in campaigns of Greek philanthropy. The same year, 1879, she started publishing ethnological material, and the first volume, `` The Isles of Eleusis, '' was followed in 1886 by volume six, `` The Greeks of Thebes and Ionia. '' In 1891, she joined the Ethnological Society of London, and after the dissolution of the Society in 1897, took the position of registrar of the National Museum of Ethnology and Ethnography, of which she held until 1912.

 = Samuel Herman Wolff =  
Samuel Herman Wolff ( 18 March 1873 – 29 June 1954 ) was a Swedish-born Australian botanist. He is credited with introducing the Wolffian system of measuring plant anatomy.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Wolff was born in Stockholm. His parents were Johan Albert Windschut Wolff and Adrianna ( her husband was the astronomer Carl Gustaf Svedberg ). Wolff was the youngest of ten children. His father followed military service during World War I and remained in Stockholm as a lieutenant-colonel. When Windschut Wolff was killed in a boat accident in 1914, Samuel went to live with his maternal grandparents in the same parish. In 1919, Wolff enrolled in secondary school at Uppsala University where he studied horticulture, botany and agricultural sciences.  
   
   
 == Scholarly career ==  
 In 1934 Wolff became a native of Stockholm. The following year, he moved to Göteborg to study at the University of Uppsala. His first papers were on cap nectar algae, but he quickly abandoned botany for its 'appearance '. His scholarly interests brought him into contact with Svante Arrhenius and Pierre Marcel Poulenc at the University of Tübingen. Wolff was eventually awarded the degree of doctor in botany in 1933 and a law degree in 1935.  
 In 1937, he immigrated to Australia to study under Max Worthington at the University of Sydney. This period was influential in Wolff's later professional career. Worthington's initial interest in and dissemination of fossilized plants is consistent with the later interest in genetics, ecology, and animal physiology that eventually brought Wolff to the international forefront. Worthington's promotion of the concept of molecular genetics of plant traits was the turning point in Wolff's life, and a direct influence on his later discoveries.In 1939, Worthington was awarded a Fellowship in Natural Sciences at the Australian National University.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 In 1944, Wolff went to Adelaide, Australia to take up the position as a lecturer in botany at the Australian National University. The position allowed Wolff to travel extensively in South Australia and investigate the relationship between South Australian communities and the behavior of their native bryophytes. From this, he came to the idea of ecological measures for the representation of ecological factors. With this understanding of the biological relationship of the environment to a social organism, he could explain an expansion of the year-round soil area.  
 In 1956, Wolff and Donald Findlay established what would become a standard mechanism of `` ecological notation '' of'microbiome and ecological system '. Wolff and Findlay developed a technique of using ordinary black and white colored'microscopy'plates to mark the microorganisms living in a region to have microscopic areas mapped for a taxonomy of species. These microorganisms are then named `` biobases '' by the authors, but the regular notation given by Wolff and Findlay was essentially established from a three-point symbol ( M, P and N ). This notation was further refined by the creation of the Wolffian system in 1958. Wolff's system expanded on the standard theory of microorganisms as groups of individual units and gained a wider variety of characteristics, particularly referred to as the Wolffian structure. This allowed this notation to relate organism types and functions that could be modeled by anatomy or vegetation. Wolff's initial system, that relied on showing the relationships between microorganisms using strict sign language, was rendered obsolete by developments in biochemistry, but other models of the system became more accurate. Wolff's new system of biological notation now is in use and has been used in more than twenty-five countries.  
 Wolff also introduced the element of element, in which the specific elements from one group are defined in terms of other'specific'groups. A species is described as being composed of

 = Edward Jaffa =  
Edward Jaffa ( 18 October 1901 – 20 December 1964 ) was an Israeli physicist who made important contributions to what we know as quantum mechanics. In 1928, he made his discovery about the six-electron colorless quark, the quark nucleus. Jaffa's work was influential in early electron theory and is still relevant.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Jaffa was born into a Jewish family to Bethe and Roy. He was educated at a yeshiva, Hebrew University, and then studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of Leopold Kronecker, a German mathematician. In 1936, Jaffa was awarded a PhD in mathematics, at the age of 19, following a lecture by John von Neumann. Later that year, he married Doris Nessa Ramzan, a mathematics PhD student. The Ramzanes later moved to the United States.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1936, Jaffa moved to Montreal, Canada, where he studied at the University of Montreal under Professor Alexis van Rooyen. In 1938, at the age of 20, Jaffa was a member of a team led by Van Rooyen and Giuseppe Tosi in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This team was led by Leonard J. Kaptchuk, who taught at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In 1941, Van Rooyen and Jaffa joined the Max Planck Institute for Theoretical Physics in Hamburg, Germany, where the research focused on electron and proton collisions in metals. In 1944, with the help of Richard Feynman, John von Neumann, Fermi and Jaffa proposed a unified approach to what is now called high-energy physics. They set out to measure the energy at the sub-photon level in the earliest theoretical particles. This was done using a method called the Feynman–Jaffa-Poisson experiment ( FJP ), also called the Field Field Planck experiment. Their calculations predicted the theoretical lowest energies, that is, the lowest energy states of the smallest known elementary particles ( the letters F, W and Z ), using the external frame of reference for the Planck measurement.Their results were important in the field of high energy physics, as it was believed that they supported the atomic model of nuclear fission. At that time, they also proposed that C=N=0. In this, they were followed by other groups, including Max Planck, who formulated a fission model in 1961. Other groups with their efforts on this and other high-energy problems included the Bohr group, the Geiger–Loeffler group and the Liouville group. In 1945, at the age of 29, Jaffa, along with Eugene Wigner, Max Born, and Andrei Sakharov were inducted into the National Academy of Sciences. In the same year, Jaffa moved to, and helped to lead the preparation of, the Geiger-Loeffler-Radcliffe–Bell curve. This work is related to the prediction of the Feynman–Jaffa field in 1947. These early calculations are still cited in today's semiconductor technology, such as CMOS and laser junction technologies. Jaffa was president of the American Physical Society from 1942 to 1943.In 1948, Jaffa became the mathematics department chair at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was instrumental in developing the two-dimensional electronic instrument ( VEL, early electronic code computer ), known as the Virvan. In 1953, he was named head of the institute's Special Projects Division, which was the youngest department in the university's history.  
   
   
 == Later life and death ==  
 In 1966, at the age of 63, Jaffa died at Berkeley from cancer, which he had caught a few months earlier. He was survived by his daughter, Ruth, and his son, Jonathan Jaffa. He is buried in Cypress, California, along with his doctoral student, Arthur P. Batchelder.

 == Life ==  
 Monastier was born at Marseilles, in the Belgian-French region of Boulogne-sur-Mer. He studied at the Collège de France. During his time in Belgium, he started to collect natural history and began working as an assistant of Jean-Nicolas-Joseph Bourcier, who was designing the Porte de Lisle gunnery range at the time. One of Monastier's first projects was to cover the walls of the baroque palaces and fortresses of Antwerp and named it, the Tower of Saint Gabriel. The port was relocated to Dijon. In 1826, Monastier traveled to Erbenholden and built the town's first cinema. The following year, he designed the Aquatrust Marine-Studios in Niedersachsen.  
 Monastier received a degree in law from the University of Paris, then returned to his alma mater, and graduated as a patent lawyer in 1832. He was appointed military officer, chief engineer, and photographer in the 82nd Regiment of Engineers under Joseph Mauss. He was wounded at the battle of Nancy and returned home, where he resumed his military career in the 82nd regiment. He was appointed military attaché to Col. Edmund-Paul d'Urville, and served with the 42nd Army Regiment, stationed in Zürich.  
 In 1843, he was promoted to colonel. He then joined the world's first navy as a commissioned officer.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1941.Black-Johns conducted a number of valuable pioneering research work, including :  
   
 `` Experiments on the diffraction of ultra-violet light '' ( 1938 )  
 `` Permutation spectra for radioactive elements '' ( 1941 )  
 `` Surface spectra of the superfluid of potassium '' ( 1942 )  
 `` Permutation spectra of xenon in plutonium '' ( 1942 )  
 `` Permutation spectra of lithium in titanite '' ( 1945 )  
 `` Reduction spectra of alpha particles '' ( 1946 )  
 `` Spectra of radioisotopes in fluoroalkali '' ( 1946 ).Black-Johns worked closely with Arthur Forbes, who was to be named Edward Jenner's successor at the Cavendish in 1952, and devised the Black-Johns–Forbes–Keirton method for analysing β-particles, which became widely known in the 1950s and 1970s.In his Nobel lecture in 1946, the theoretical physicist N. N. W. Neeliot proposed the Black-Johns-type quantum electrodynamics for designing an electric motor, before showing that the motor dissipated in a bundle of electrons. Later work in this field in spin-spin duality and magnetic monopoles under the tutelage of Einstein strongly promoted the Black-Johns–Weyl and Weyl–Neliot classes of theory, and with Neeliot's biographer Alan Stanley brought general quantum electrodynamics to the attention of theoretical physicists.Black-Johns died on 6 February 1978, leaving a widow, two sons, a daughter, and one grandchild. He was survived by his wife Isabel, a sister, Peter W., a brother-in-law and her husband, and a sister, Ellen.

 = Sandro Bernardi =  
Sandro Bernardi ( 8 August 1886 – 26 January 1972 ) was an Italian physicist and the father of mycologist Sandro Bernardi ( 1885-1971 ).  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Sandro Bernardi was born in Parma. His family immigrated to Switzerland from Naples. In 1912, he graduated from the conservatory in Pozzuoli with an international certificate, and in 1916 he became a teacher. He then went on to obtain his doctorate in physics in Bern. He was assistant professor at the Technische Hochschule in Zurich and finally professor at the University of Giessen in Switzerland in 1929. In 1937 he accepted the professorship at the University of Vienna, Austria, which he occupied until 1953. In 1946 he was given the rank of full professor.From 1938 to 1952 he was a professor at the Istituto Nazionale di Cimenti ( `` Natural Science Institute '' ) of the University of Naples ( which closed in 1955 ). In 1948, he became a full professor at the University of Hamburg, Germany. In 1952 he accepted the chair of mycology at the State University of the Galilee in the former Greek island of Lesbos.  
 From 1952 to 1961 he was a full professor at the University of Rome, Italy, where he served as the Department Chair. From 1959 to 1968 he was a full professor at the University of South Africa, Rhodesia, South Africa. From 1963 to 1970 he was a full professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, USA. In 1973 he moved to the University of Arizona as an associate professor.  
 Sandro Bernardi had been strongly influenced by Arnold Sommerfeld.  
   
   
 == Selected writings ==  
 In 1952, he and his wife Silvia published Silvia Bernardi's Monograph on Crystalline Chromatin. In 1962, he co-authored Vigors Unbound, a monograph on the Crystal Structure of Palkines. The monograph was well received and was published in 1964.  
 Sandro Bernardi was the first mycologist to report in detail the pattern of ribosome DNA folding. He described a subunit that is known as the 7-stranded RAPD. Later he developed a method for characterizing macromolecules with the single-stranded variant of the RAPD. In his 1969 paper, `` Pending DNA Biology : Exploring the Protein Function of Chromosomes '', Bernardi introduced the idea of the molecular weight index, which ultimately led to the establishment of the molecular structure of DNA.  
 In 1974, he described `` New Evolutions in the Construction of Chromosomes ''.  
 In 1972, the Mycological Society of Southern California published his monograph Abiogenesis and Embryology of T. pneumoniae in their Bulletin. This was published jointly with other authors, Bernardi included : David M. Weir ; Dean Friedman ;, Hugh Roach ; Leo Moss ; John W. Jamieson ; Frank Sprague ; and Harold Greysman.

 = Johann Heinrich Buss =  
Johann Heinrich Buss ( 22 November 1747 – 28 December 1812 ) was a German anatomist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Buss was born at Johannesburg in the Kingdom of Brandenburg. He studied medicine at the University of Würzburg and was a corresponding member of the Royal Institute of Anatomy ( 1769–1776 ), a corresponding member of the Institute of Anatomy ( 1778–1785 ), a corresponding member of the Royal Veterinary College of Berlin ( 1786–1830 ), and a corresponding member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Anatomie und Chemie ( `` Council for Statistical and Medical Legislation '' ). He is remembered for his valuable contributions to the field of microscopic anatomy, and his discussion of evidence of disease in the human body during the first half of the 19th century ( particularly in regards to nervous system diseases ). He is known for his valuable work, Die vomkriften Anatomie des Sommerkranken ( `` Contributions to the Anatomical Sciences of the Twentieth Century '' ), which also serves as the first attempt at a compendium of anatomically related disciplines.  
 Buss's chief work is Die Insectes Ebersätzungen, or Fundamental features of the nervous system, which was completed in 1789. His vast contribution to systematic anatomy of the nervous system served as the basic theoretical framework for the concept of anatomy of the nervous system from classical times. Throughout his career, Buss published roughly five hundred scientific papers. He is best known for his work on consciousness and behavior, especially the question of consciousness within the mind. His influence on scientific thought continues today.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Buss was born to a wealthy Saxon family in 1747. At a young age, Buss suffered from a nervous disability which resulted in a weakened position in which he was unable to reach the upper part of his body. He was appointed as a child school teacher in the Kingdom of Brandenburg and returned to school in the principality of Baden ( today's Hesse-Darmstadt ) in 1759. He achieved an undergraduate degree from the University of Würzburg in 1760 and a doctorate in 1762.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1763, the young Johann Buss became a physician and returned to teaching at the home of his family in Baden, where he continued his medical practice and became a contributor to the 1802 ‘ The University's Review ’ which was based on medical observations collected by his father and the schoolmaster, Johann Julius von Sieglius.In 1768, Buss obtained a doctorate in medicine at the University of Leipzig from Johann Karl Apollonius Hahnemann. In 1770, he became a first vice-chancellor of the university at Halle, and in 1778 was promoted to the post of professor of anatomy. Buss remained at Halle for the rest of his life.  
   
 Buss was a prolific writer on medical topics, including, among other topics, notes on various insect bites, emetic poisoning, neurosis, and hypertonia.  
 Buss developed a theory of consciousness, not to be confused with entoptic consciousness.  
 Buss helped to establish a practical academic journal for systematic anatomy.Buss's writings include :  
 The Mathematical Notes of Johann Heinrich Buss, Trans. by Roger Laycock, a preliminary treatise on the field of mathematical surgery, published in 1777  
 The Manual of Pupils and Apparatus of Surgeons, published in 1779 and published again in 1779 and 1780  
 A Manual of Anatomy in Correspondance with the Two Book Sects and its Continuation, published in 1781  
 Studies on the Nerves of the Conveyors and Disintegrators, published in 1784  
 On Masticators and the Wound Saw ( a rather large, though smaller, treatise that contains his approach to metal masticators and dissecting apparatus ), published in 1784

 = Heike Hennis =  
Heike ( ʒe, h ˈɛyti ) Hanz Peder Heike ( February 25, 1900 – June 27, 2007 ) was a German mathematician, known for his pioneering work in symbolic computing.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Heike, born March 25, 1900, in Kirchfeld, Western Germany, was a mathematics student. He attended the Faculty of Science, University of Heidelberg and obtained his doctorate in 1924. From 1925 to 1938, he was professor of the Department of Mathematics at Heidelberg, which was renamed to the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics in 1936. Between 1938 and 1940, he was Head of the department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg ( Habilitation ). At the time of his death he was a full professor in his home institute and died in Freiburg.  
 Heike was elected an Honorary Member of the American Mathematical Society in 1976. He earned his M.S. ( 1927 ) and Ph.D. ( 1929 ) from the University of Freiburg, and later a professorship in mathematics at Heidelberg. He married Elsa Augusta ( 1930–1996 ), who was also a mathematician at the University. The couple had two children : Angela Dohlfried Heike ( 1983–2007 ) and Felix Heike ( 1978–2008 ).  
 Heiko was one of the founders of modern mathematical computing, in part because he was willing to wait for Computex before accepting the IBM Babbage supercomputer. His research and development in graphical data processing preceded the advancement of vectorized algorithms. As a forerunner to computer algebra, Heike devised methods for classifying lines of graphical data.In 1977 Heike was made a corresponding member of the IEEE and awarded the famous Weibull Medal. He wrote the paper I. L. Schneier on Sieve of Eratosthenes, in which he attempts to derive an optimal implementation of Sieve.  
 Heike received many honors and awards. The Gustav Schnabel Prize of the Mathematical Society of Berlin ( 1982 ) and the William H. Berry Medal of the American Statistical Association ( 1989 ), as well as the 2004 Bertelsmann Prize, were his. In 2006 the John von Neumann Award was instituted in his honor.  
   
   
 == Other honors ==  
 In the field of linear algebra Heike is credited with discovering the very distinctive formulation of the Heike–Chesforth conjecture.

 = Gustav Hertz (minister) =  
Gustav Friedrich Hertz ( April 5, 1851, Berlin - September 8, 1917, Hamburg ) was a German doctor and theologian.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 His father, Gustav Hermann Hertz ( 1836–1908 ), was a professor at the University of Königsberg. Gustav studied theology in Bonn, and obtained his doctorate in 1879.  
 He worked as a priest in the German Episcopal Church in Hamburg. While there, he influenced the young Wilhelm Hauptmann, who in 1885 founded the Baptist weekly Gesellschaftliche Zeitung in Hamburg. In 1886, he became associate pastor at the Synodal Church of the Resurrection, Hamburg. In 1895, he was named professor of Dogmatic Theology at the University of Hamburg.He was a prolific writer, including textbooks on medieval thought, and most of his theological works have since been translated into more than 40 languages.  
 The Gerhard Hofmann Freiburg congregational building is named after him.  
 The Hans Christian Storr St. Petersburg University named the Christian Church of St. Peter and St. Paul on 16 November 2009 as the church of Gustav Hertz.  
   
   
 == Writings ==  
 In Die Religion ( Kantner Verlag, 1888 ), Hertz drew a comparison between the Pelagian doctrines of Thomism and mysticism, arguing that although they were inspired by faith, their `` dogmatic grounds '' had `` deeper intellectual underpinnings '', such as the being of God in Christ.In Die Religion ( Wien, 1894 ), the philosophic focus of the work was on Thomism and ethics.  
 In Die Religion ( Leipzig, 1898 ),, Hertz attempted to suggest a teleology. He argued that theology as a discipline can begin from `` as deistic an internal sense of individuality and its generative theme '' as `` the reflection and propagation of an indivisible ontological or philosophic state ''.In Die Religion ( Wien, 1900 ), he defended an ontological argument for prescience. According to this claim, when we know a thing, the knowledge gives us knowledge of God, the positing of which originates in prior knowledge.

Francis Fraser Hamilton-Silva ( 16 February 1852 – 22 December 1941 ) was a British surveyor.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Hamilton-Silva was born in Cheltenham, Surrey. He was educated at Cheltenham Grammar School before joining the observatory work at the University of Edinburgh in 1876. In 1884 he took up a job at the Colonial Office as assistant surveyor, working with Edwin Townsend in some of the north-east Atlantic islands of Western Australia. In 1892, he was appointed as the first Director of the Geodetic Survey of India.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Hamilton-Silva married Frances Edward Cole, daughter of the Honourable John Cole, 1st Baron Cole of Sarsfield, in 1878. They had a daughter and two sons, Charles and Felix. He died in India and is interred at St Marys Cathedral in Calcutta.John Hamilton-Silva was a builder of mills, bridges and reservoirs and also employed in the survey of the Great Zimbabwe and Great Zimbabwe river. He visited India twice with a group of people from the Government Geographical Society.  
   
   
 == Marriages ==  
 In 1902 he married the widow, T. M. Irving, daughter of the 1st Baron Irving of Colchester. They had seven children :

 == Natural Sciences ==  
 Hamilton-Silva's most significant scientific work, however, was the study of the shape of India, specifically the India–Pakistan boundary and in particular the outline of a Ganges river. He examined the dynamics of the Ganges and calculated the area covered by it and the width of its main flowing stream. To this he added the possibility of an arc flowing through it through known friction and influence of the Ganges. These results are now called Hamiltonian processes. His work is often cited for its historical value.

Jules Florin-Campe ( 15 September 1814 – 24 March 1903 ) was a French naturalist and ornithologist, professor of botany at the University of Paris, author of Florin's Chronicles of herpetology and author of two important monographs on the genus Parabroma.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Florin's father was a surgeon.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was a native of Lyon. He was an assistant in the Botany Department at the University of Paris, specialising in flora, herbaria and palaeontology, which took him to botany, ethology, zoology and biological and comparative anatomy of birds.  
 He was interested in ornithology, especially the herpetological and palaeontological specialities, but also specialised in taxonomy and systematic structure of shells and spiders. He specialised in the materials made from fossilized prey, which formed an interest for his students, which included Paul Puil, Eugène Mircea Eliade and Olivier Florest, whose collections were now well known to the naturalists of the day.  
 His career was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War, which was centred on Lyon, and to which he resigned his professorship in 1864. He did, however, write a large number of papers on the `` first insect of North Africa '' in the Proceedings of the Académie française de Botanique. He was elected a member of the Société d'Histoire Naturelle ( Société Nationale de Histoire Naturelle ), and was offered an appointment at the University of Paris, where he continued to write until his death.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Campe was the author of Florin's Chronicles of herpetology.  
 Florin's Chronicles is the first description of Despisiornis melanopus, the second spider species of African origin, and its closely related Lufbebeia poikalensis.  
 He published several works on the comparative morphology of spider eyes and lenses, and specialised in the material made from fossilized prey.Florin's first published work, The Description de l'empereur ( 'Thief'), appeared in 1849, the second, Les derniers systèmes entomologiques ( 1848 ), in 1851. In both his monographs, he attempted to popularise European entomology.

 = John George Wilder =  
Sir John George Wilder FRS ( 1885–1950 ) was a British bacteriologist, nutritionist and researcher in food culture.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wilder was born in Swindon in 1885. He studied at Balliol College, Cambridge, from 1918 to 1919, and was knighted by King George VI for his services to science. He began his academic career at the Department of Biological Sciences, University College London ( UCL ) in 1919 and, when his post was promoted to Physiology and Chemical Laboratory ( PCL ), continued to hold the post.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 Wilder conducted a large number of investigations relating to various aspects of food culture, research equipment, life cycle and malic acid tolerance.  
 In 1925 he published his pioneering article `` An Introductory Examination of the Protein Structure of Wheat '' which had a profound influence on the field of food science. The article used stereochemistry to determine the amino acid sequence of the wheat proteins. He was the first to demonstrate that wheat proteins contained starch, which led to a renewed interest in starch and agriculture in the post war era.In 1936 he suggested that sugar be found in cattle milk. This work led to the establishment of a department of nutrition at UCL called the Microbiology Laboratory and Wilder was its chairman. He was also its senior research officer. His research at PCL and UCL contributed to the establishment of the research laboratory at Imperial College London in the 1930s.  
 During World War II, Wilder spent time in Singapore. In 1946 he developed the Wilder Index to help identify malformations in the flour and rice that could be attributed to possible inoculated cholera.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 At the outbreak of the Second World War, Wilder was awarded the Military Cross in the Bathurst ( 4 ) and Royal Victorian Cross ( 8 ) for his gallantry in action in the British forces. His combat record earned him the code : 214489.  
 In 1955 the Experimental Biology Society of Great Britain and Ireland ( EBS ) commissioned him to study bacteria at the Institute of Medical Microbiology, Imperial College London.In 1961 Wilder was made a Companion of the Order of the British Empire and received an honorary Doctorate of Science from University College London.

 Ostwald was born in Lyngsland, Norway, a cousin of Ulf Ostwald. His father was Jesper Ostwald, the church administrator of Lyngsland. He studied physics at the University of Copenhagen.  
 Ostwald's mathematical contributions are used in modern theoretical physics. He invented a new metric to describe the periodic structure of atoms and was one of the few physicists who improved the Hilbert space-preserving principle. His measurements of alpha decay in high-energy electrons at high frequency, in the so-called Anglo-American case, established the standard for the interference frequency.

In 1705 he was appointed to the chair of the anatomy of the mineral law of Saxony. He died in Würzburg.His work, his influence, and his attention have been developed to such a point that it is said that `` Engelmann's writing was the principal factor in the development of the science of natural history in Germany. ''  
 Engelmann is considered to be the first modern German botanist and the first botanist to thoroughly demonstrate that mosses can persist in any climate. Some present-day lichen species derived from Engelmann's microscopic work can still be seen on Mars.

 == Life ==  
 Olga Pavlovna Saltsman was born in Saint Petersburg, to the Cheka at the time the White Army seized power in Russia in February 1848. She graduated from the University of Saint Petersburg in 1868, and later studied law, philosophy, philosophy, journalism and sociology.  
 In 1876 Saltsman established the Independent Russian Theatre, a newly founded theatre in Saint Petersburg ( now part of Kazan University ) that was co-founded by M. and E. L. Yosifovich. The independent theatre became popular, and members took to calling themselves `` the Renegade Theatre ''. In 1889 Saltsman opened the History of Socialism Society. She is the author of the classic essay `` From Proletary Socialism to the Russian Revolution '', a work that was taken up by the Comintern with a mass movement. In 1892 Saltsman wrote 'The Great Famine and the Young Revolution in Russia,'which remains a classic.  
 She was the third of six children of Alexander and Anna Saltsman, from a merchant family in St. Petersburg. At an early age Olga had an immense interest in music, and at the age of sixteen she founded her own band. She began to compose at a young age, and studied painting and rhetoric at the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg. She became active in theatre, and in 1892 was awarded the Vladimir Pozniak Prize of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg.In 1897 Saltsman began her two-volume work from the point of view of popular sociology, which she edited between 1899 and 1902. In this work she used the logic of free will in order to make Marxist theory possible. She theorised that history was based on `` reciprocal effects '' of economic competition between competing social forces. In an effort to 'raise the level of consciousness ', she opposed religious superstition and all forms of nationalism.Saltsman was the last writer to write a review of a sociological work, with her only work published being a review of Herrn Frisch's Lehrbuch der politischen Künste in 1896. In 1902, Saltsman became a member of the Inner Party, an anarcho-communist youth organization based in Moscow, and she was jailed in 1905 for her work.In 1907 Saltsman left the Communist Party and founded the independent Russian Theatre and made the Life Course into a popular course in 1905, covering a range of subjects. She published over seventy articles and a book, the People's Leader : An Ecological Approach to Man. The book was first published in 1913.She retired from the Russian stage in 1918.

Leo Jinkin ( 30 August 1898 – 14 February 1974 ) was a Soviet scientist, inventor and a founder of the Sverdlovsk Institute of Machine Tools ( part of the Moscow State University ). He is considered the father of mechanical computing and machine learning. Jinkin and Vassily Sakharov are noted for popularizing the phrase, `` The double helix is more efficient than the single helix ''. Jinkin developed the earliest computer, the radio telescope called the `` C-Star '', which simultaneously performed better than any of the current successor structures to the photo-electron microscope ( PEM ), and the first computer using chemical reaction control ( CRTC ). The C-Star was later upgraded to the 200-bit ( 48 Kbit ) C-Star, and is still used today. According to US research, the machine language `` human language '' was created for this work. Jinkin was assassinated by Soviet intelligence, but his widow and three other assistants were not.According to the Encyclopedia of Mankind or Guinness Book of World Records, Jinkin is the only person ( in the history of the world ) to have designed the disc drive on both sides of a penny.On 20 June 1971, with his wife Elena, Jinkin was killed by the Soviet secret police while they were returning from a dinner party. He is buried in the Golgotha Oblast cemetery.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He graduated from Moscow State University in 1904, and pursued a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Optics at Moscow State University.

He was also the chairman of the permanent commission of knowledge at the Central Technical High School for Scientific Machines ( 1913 ). Jinkin helped to found the Moscow State University's Institute of Mechanical Engineering and Optics in 1914. His father in law, Vassily Sakharov, is also remembered for founding the physics department at Moscow State University.He was actively involved in the Russian Civil Service in numerous positions including writing editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica, architect of the city of Moscow, former student council member of the Moscow State University, member of various socialist and military councils, and was elected in the first triennial commission of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1926.  
 Jinkin's work for scientific development of the use of electricity in computers led to development of computer hardware for military intelligence and top secret research and designs.  
 Jinkin became a founding member of the Moscow State University's Institution of Machine Tools and that same year, he was appointed professor of Mechanical Engineering and Optics ( IOME ). His professorships followed within the institute. In 1922, Jinkin became director of the Military Institute ( `` Central Industrial Power Corporation '' ) in Novokuznetsk. The institute started its work at the Moscow Geological Institute on the Anodized steel and alloys of the Timoelectric Reflection and Refractory Machinery in 1917.

 = Lee Scott Ames =  
Lee Scott Ames ( September 27, 1878 in Rosedale, New York – February 20, 1954 in Orange, California ) was an American economist. He is considered a pioneer in the study of organic farming. Ames began working on a study of organic agriculture in the early 1890s, and it came to an end in 1920.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Lee Scott Ames was born on September 27, 1878 in Rosedale, New York, a place few farmers of the time would recognize as unique, being the location where land had been acquired by the newly opened Rosedale Mansion in 1874. He moved to Orange, California to attend the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1905, after which he enrolled in graduate school at the University of Rochester. In 1910 he returned to Berkeley to continue his graduate studies. He continued his studies in political economy and industrial policy, then continued his work on organic agriculture.  
   
   
 == Agricultural work ==  
 During his time at Berkeley, Ames developed a general understanding of organic farming, which helped him and his fellow student Professor Hugh Alexander to translate the textbook Organic Farm Farming by Lucy Steenkamp and Samuel Forbes for reference in the teaching of the student body. The two farm scientists were able to improve organic agriculture considerably in part by having them practice practicing under conditions that had not been in place for past generations. Ames and Alexander were able to develop methods and processes for bettering organic farming that would be used until the end of their time at Berkeley.  
 Ames's study of organic agriculture was published in the results of the first study of organic farming, the Organic Farm Farm Survey of 1901, which was undertaken by the University of Rochester. He also worked on the wheat-growing experiments of Charles Sowerby and developed his farm methods for control and improvement of those methods and methods.  
   
   
 == Later career ==  
 After having become well known through his research in the field of organic farming, Ames left Berkeley to become Director of the University's Agricultural Experiment Station in Albany, New York in 1921, a position he held until his retirement in 1954. He continued to publish in organic agriculture throughout his career.One of the main achievements of his career was his role in using the statistical techniques he developed to analyze the data of organic agriculture, making it possible to plot the production characteristics of a field against the other economic factors associated with the crop in terms of price, other markets, productivity, population growth, etc. In 1917, he was made a corresponding member of the Linnean Society, the second such recognition in agriculture.

 = Gilbert Frederick Worthy =  
Gilbert Frederick Worthy, ( December 25, 1738 – October 10, 1798 ) was an American explorer, cartographer, and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was the son of Samuel Francis Worthy of Warren, Vermont. He attended school in Dighton, Vermont, and at the same time took a lesson in Euclid and went on to attend Dartmouth College in the spring of 1751. He left there on account of his inexperience with mathematics and obtained an MA at Dartmouth in the summer of 1753. His previous studies, mainly at the University of Paris, were interrupted by his engagement in West India in the autumn of 1755. There he proceeded to Dresden, Germany, where he published a critical commentary on many treatises of Hermann Hoppe, and followed this expedition with a series of expeditions to French Guiana and Java, succeeding in 1762, at the beginning of which period the White Mountain in California was named. In 1763 Worthy started a voyage from Europe into Africa, which he resumed the following year with the help of Captain William Dale. He went overland on the Danube and the Striga to the extent of the British Isles, before returning to America on the following July 30, 1764. In the western part of the United States he explored in the interior, accompanied by several assistants. He arrived in San Antonio, Texas in December 1765 and was the first naturalist to visit the country, and perhaps in the history of geology to make any known discoveries there. On February 14, 1766, Worthy was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and elected a member in 1770 and subsequently the first President of that society.After living at San Antonio, Worthy died, leaving a son and a daughter.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 In 1755, Worthy published, with ten other learned men and women, the Travels of a Voyage to Europe, and South America, the Risalah of a Voyage to Egypt, and a Description of the western Continent, with the True Geography and Antiquities of America. It was published at Philadelphia by W. H. Penn, Edward Hopton, and Lewis Hopkins.  
 Worthy surveyed Colorado and part of Utah.  
 In 1769 he constructed a cannon ballast and an axiomak-puller for purpose of mining.  
 A magnetometer was employed to measure the earth's magnetic axis. He was also the first to spot Venus in June 1774.  
 In 1781, he completed a quadrant model for use by engravers. The same model has been made by Robert Wilkinson, M.D. It was taken to New York and the Philadelphia Museum.He was called by the American Association for the Advancement of Science one of the `` Truth-bearers of Science in America '', and a delegate at the Philadelphia Convention in 1791. He was one of the founders of the American Philosophical Society, the nation's first scientific society, and gave its first two annual lectures.  
 He was the foreman of a survey of the New Holland river by Thomas William Leighton, which found numerous glaciers and other topographical features.  
 He surveyed a century's worth of mining settlements in Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, and California, as well as exploring the tropics and oceans of South America.

 = James Thomson, 1st Earl of Nottingham =  
James Thomson, 1st Earl of Nottingham, ( 2 January 1843 – 1 August 1918 ) was an English and British mathematician and statistician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Thomson was born on 2 January 1843 in Borland, Kent, the son of Sir James Thomson and Eleanor Ballot, née Hamley. He was the third of five children, the eldest son of Thomas Thomson, a pharmacist. His father, a notable amateur physician, was also the grandson of the painter William Bellingham and an uncle of George Bellingham. Thomson was educated at Eton College and the Imperial College of Science and Technology, Cambridge, where he became a doctor in 1891. After completing his medical studies, Thomson became a demonstrator at the Royal Institution in 1888. He became associate professor of statistics in 1892 and Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics at Cambridge in 1893. At the same time, he set up the School of Statistics at Cambridge, the first in the country. He was appointed by Herbert Samuel to head a Department of Statistical Studies in 1896. On his retirement in 1914, he was made Prentis Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.  
   
   
 === Early life in Europe ===  
 Having turned down an offer from the LSE to become a lecturer in 1920 at the University of Jena, Thomson soon moved to Europe where he was soon invited by the Société royale de physique to become its director of research.  
 After the war ended, Thomson travelled around Europe and discovered numerous new trends in mathematics and statistics, for which he won the Grégorian Society Prize, and the 1915 Marconi Prize for Generalising the power of population distribution. This and his increasing prominence as a leader on the international mathematics scene began to influence the future of mathematics and statistics in Britain. The future of mathematical and statistical sciences there was further bound by international laws and conventions, and by high standards of evidence and rigour, and if Thomson saw any other pattern in Europe he would often be able to comment on it in the public journals.  
   
   
 === Marriage and family ===  
 In 1912 Thomson married Barbara Newton and had two sons and three daughters. At the outbreak of World War I, Thomson's son William James joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a cadet and returned to England as a lieutenant. There was little intention of re-establishing the Thomson tradition in Britain. When war broke out in 1914, a series of deep recessions and cutbacks were felt to adversely affect the reputation of the state.In 1916, Thomson became tutor to children at the School of Economics and Political Science at St John's College in Guildford, Kent. In 1919, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He continued to publish papers in the Society's Annual Report and later wrote articles on economic planning, for which he was awarded the Ronald Medal.  
   
   
 === Lady  
 In 1920, Thomson had three more sons, including Charles James Thomson.  
 On his death at his son's birth the US National Library of Medicine published a memorial to Thomson, `` Thomson, Sir. ''  
 Thomson met Lady Ellen Gaylor ; they married on 27 September 1926 at Dublin's South Court, Magherafelt Street, the youngest son being named Charles.  
 His grandson Christopher Gaylor, third Baroness Janet, became the last Lord Beveridge of the Gaylor family.

Othniel Schlei ( November 14, 1835 – May 16, 1912 ) was an American German composer, teacher, and teacher. Schlei's music addresses the aspirations and needs of ordinary people, including his own. His music is rooted in the classical tradition, and also focuses on modernist and neo-classical music.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Stuttgart, Schlei began to compose early in life. In 1840, he moved to Berlin to teach music to students. In 1851, he established himself as a teacher at the Munchhausen Music Academy, becoming the president of the German Society of Music in 1857. In 1860, he founded the Schlei Music School and taught music there until his death. He also held several honorary degrees from prestigious universities. Schlei was the son of a prominent politician, businessman, artist, author, and teacher, named Adolf Schlei.  
 Schlei was primarily a teacher of classical music, but is notable for writing the pieces to his own music and teaching classical music in Germany during the French Empire. Among his pupils was composer Hans Zimmer, who wrote an official recital piece for the occasion. His most important pupils included composer Ludwig van Beethoven, e.g. the family of music critic Cornelis ( William ) Wirtzel. His compositions were produced in large numbers. Schlei's music was extremely popular in Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and other countries.

 = Walter D. Mullan =  
Walter D. Mullan ( October 21, 1917 – November 6, 2005 ) was an American chemist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, and studied chemistry at Harvard University. His brother, Gordon, was an American botanist who, in 1950, demonstrated the genetic determinism of Colchicum.  
 In 1951, Dr. Mullan published a paper called `` Primary and Secondary Responses of a Phenomenon to various Heterogeneous Conditions '' in the field of physical chemistry. In it, he suggested that the secondary reaction, typically referred to as an oxygen-oxidation reaction, takes place when a compound is subjected to pressures of four bar, but in fact is a facultative, or facultative C2 reaction, which results in a final product of a compound that is more oxidized at neutral ( pH = 4.0 ) or in acidic ( pH = 4.5 ) conditions. These `` oxidative conditions '' cause the product to oxidize oxygen, leaving the product impure and unusable.  
 In 1953, at the age of 42, he became Director of Research for the Chemical Division of the Minerals and Metals Agency ( now the American Chemical Society ). His other accomplishments include the development of phosphocreatine as an energy-saving, fuel-saving, and organic-chemical polymer. His chemical and physical investigations were influential in scientific contributions to the field of biochemistry, petrology, biophysics, and pest control.  
 Mullan also investigated the origins of sulfuric acid in the soil.

 During his first years in Paris, he studied with the gifted composer Jules Massenet, whom he described as the man `` who, by composing great works for orchestra and chamber orchestra, won for music the esteem of every student. '' Among his teachers were the pianists Antonio Ravel, Antonio Cortes, Felix Orlandes, and Claude-Michel Trocchi. Pilett later gave him a performance of the Mannheim String Quartet's Turandot on an A9 905, and the Pontecorvo Quartet's Tosca on a two-handed keyboard.Pelletier joined the École Normale Supérieure in 1903, after he had studied under Clara Penrose-Gymnasium and the renowned teaching staff of Claude Monod.From 1912 to 1919 he was a teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris, the National Conservatory, and the Paris Conservatoire.He composed a concerto, Oboe Concerto, Op. 24, and works for piano. His two works for piano, Violin Concerto ( 1906–1912 ) and String Quartet No. 1 in E major for piano, which, along with his performance of the 4th movement of Schubert's The Lady of Sufism, constitute his Impromptus, have received large concerts and recording, and was the subject of a 2008 documentary about him.He also wrote operas, ballet and dramas, two plays, and two piano sonatas. He died in Paris, aged 86, after a long illness.  
 The Nicolae Lenz Handel Concert ( known as the Tour d'Alfabet ) was inaugurated at the Eiffel Tower by the composer and conductor. It was composed in three acts, with a first act not performed and an encore work first performed on July 21, 1945.

Eugene Christian Pietro Petrey ( Italian : [ ˈpteʁʁɪs ˈpʁɪx ˈjoʁʁɪjɪt ] ; 7 October 1752 – 8 July 1807 ) was an Italian physician, anatomist and botanist. He made an important contribution to the anatomy of the skull. He is credited as the first to observe the formation of a biopse, or `` development from incisor to ulna '' in the skull, in 1764.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Petrey was born in Palermo, on 7 October 1752. He was the nephew of the scientist Gaetano Petrey, and was also the great-great-great-great-great-grandson of the German cartographer Carl Petrey. He studied medicine in Naples under Nicola Tesla, who in turn encouraged him to follow the study of anatomy, and in the process encouraged him to be a physician. In 1774, he graduated from the University of Naples with the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. He stayed with Tesla in California, where he became acquainted with the celebrated surgeon Charles Wirth, who later helped to write his treatise, Anatomia Chimica Medicina, published in 1779. In 1784, he was elected a member of the Entomological Society of London, and in 1789 became its inaugural president. The name `` Petrey '' was probably proposed by Wirth, who became his assistant.Petrey practiced anatomy in Montpellier from 1792 until his death, when he moved to Florence, where he published A Neue Anatomie zu Vienna ( A New Anatomy of Vienna ). From 1793 until his death, Petrey was Secretary of the Royal Society of Medicine, and in 1797, he was President of the Academy of Medicine.

 = Thomas Parker Abbott =  
Thomas Parker Abbott ( 12 September 1829 – 29 September 1905 ) was an English theologian, specializing in the ethics of sexual morality. Abbott was born on 12 September 1829, and educated at Dorpingham School, Cambridge. He was associated with the University of Cambridge from 1848 to 1856 and Trinity College, Oxford, from 1856 to 1866. He held the chair of theology and philosophy at the London School of Economics from 1868 to 1876. Abbott was a preacher, teacher and Christian missionary, and, during his life, published over twenty works.  
 Abbott was a prolific writer, and his Institutes and Abridgments is one of the best known Bible and theological treatises of his day. In the introduction to it he concludes that `` the use of the Bible as the sole model for the ethical and political problems connected with family life is unquestionable, as is its qualification to govern the community itself ''. He is known for his account of love as an ethical ideal, which emphasized the truth that love involves the assurance of the object of love's affection'being reciprocated ; the teaching of equal consideration and justification for loving the same person in all circumstances ; and the authorship of the Code of Moral Conduct, with the doctrine of the doctrine of justification by faith, which he `` restored to the Christian conscience '', in his 1894 version of what is now called moral absolutism. His focus of many theological debates centred on homosexuality and other sexual immorality, and the moral function of the church.Abbott died at Peterborough, Berkshire, and was buried in St Paul's Churchyard, London, in 1905.

Louis Berthoud ( 6 February 1790 – 29 October 1854 ) was a French philologist and philosopher.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Berthoud was born at La Sarne, in the Nîmes. His father was a ‘ gold-smith ’ ; his mother, Marguerite Berthoud, was a mathematician. He was educated in the Tuileries, at the end of which his book was translated into English. In his youth he loved political economy, both in the framework of individualism and empiricism, and became an amateur economist. In 1793, when the Revolution of 1789 was still just beginning, he headed the Committee for Public Credit, which published a pamphlet entitled “ Economics and Political Economy. ” In addition to the influence of this publication, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly, which established the Council of State in 1789. In June 1789 he worked with Jacob de Graaff on a book on education for children entitled “ Etudes physiologiques sur l ’ éducation générale. ” This work is still in print and has been translated into various languages. He went on to write what is known as the Berthoud-Leverist ’ – the view that the experience of childhood is a leading factor in the development of reason.  
 In 1803 Berthoud became a member of the American Philosophical Society, and was promoted to full member in 1807. He was awarded the Jean de Heverie medal by the British Academy in 1824. His expositions on philosophy and economics form the second and third volumes of his three-volume treatise on the subject. One of his pupils was the painter Frederick Strahan. He was elected to the French Academy in 1816 and served for one term as rector of the Faculty of Philosophy at Paris. In 1823 he was elected to the Académie française, and was made a member the following year. In 1833 he was the first member of the English Academy of Sciences. His final publication was Des Études de l ’ l ’ École d'Econometrique sur l ’ a du cantique du Politique et l ’ a du Pédagogie, and of his history of the French intellectual life.He died on 29 October 1854 in Paris, leaving behind a wife and five children.

 He was one of the main contributors to the theory of the quantum mechanics of Compton scattering.  
 He is best known for his work on the Compton effect, where he stated in 1921 that the Compton effect of an electron interacting with a neutron is only reflected by the electron if the particle is large enough in mass.  
 In 1931, he developed a special symmetry gauge for the Compton scattering of high energy particles in the cavity of an atomic nucleus.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Vlasov was born on October 18, 1887 in Leningrad Oblast into a family of mixed background. His family emigrated from Russia during the Russian Civil War. His father Ilya Mikhailovich Vlasov, a physician and a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, received his high school education in Moscow, and received a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Leningrad in 1912. From 1913, he worked in a hospital in Leningrad.  
 Vlasov went to join the University of Tübingen in 1919, where he graduated as an instructor in organic chemistry and astrophysics. His doctoral thesis, `` A Statistical Study of the Charge or Quantities of Gamma Rays in an Ionizing Medium '', on the absorption of electrons of an electron-like particle, attracted the attention of his future mentor, the Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov. This paper did not result in a thesis, but the two met again. Sakharov wrote to Vlasov about the outstanding materialistic study in basic physics, and requested Vlasov to join him in the entomology department at Tübingen. While in Germany, Vlasov wrote to Sakharov about what he had learnt on the bosons from Howard Fleming, concerning the decay of beta particles, one of the signatories to Feynman's paper.In 1922, he obtained a position as head of the physics department at St. Petersburg State University. In 1928, he obtained a position as a lecturer in physics at Moscow State University. Later, he held the posts of professor and vice-rector at Moscow University and Leningrad State University.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Vlasov made contributions to the problem of the Compton effect in the field of weak-electron scattering. He played a key role in establishing the concept of the measurement of the electron's momentum. He demonstrated that electrons could move much faster than Newton's second law of motion, and showed that his results about the Compton scattering would apply only in an electron–positron pair. In his paper, he found a new gauge, which still remains in use today.

Abbie William Turner ( 1891-1939 ) was a British physicist who worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City.She earned her PhD in Physics from the University of Edinburgh in 1916, at the age of 24, under the supervision of Henry Cockcroft, a young and ambitious young civil servant. Her research at the Laboratory of Electromagnetic Research ( London ) was very influential in the development of the electro-magnetic revolution. She was a pre-eminent scientific figure during the second world war, and a confidant to wartime scientists.  
 She was the first woman to take part in what became known as the `` demarcation '' of the three `` races '' of man. Her work with Joseph Elvin Shapiro made the previously one-sided nature of this `` division '' untenable. She published one of the first laws of physics in 1916, giving a mathematical basis for the ionosphere and mesosphere. In 1918, she proposed that the electrically charged particles responsible for aurora borealis must also be responsible for precipitation. Her work was received with cautious enthusiasm in Britain. In January 1919, Turner was arrested by the Home Office for contempt of court. As a consequence of this and later 'investigations ', Turner was arrested for having taken part in the `` League of Nations '''s Conference at Hanoi, along with the editors of the Evening Standard, the Daily Telegraph and the Saturday Mirror. This led to her being acquitted of contempt in 1924. Turner was also censured by the British press for her alleged involvement in the creation of a `` war school '' at Edinburgh for black soldiers, likely using them as guinea pigs in development of machine gun sights and communication equipment.  
 She died on 12 February 1939 in the Weehawken, New Jersey home of her friend Mary Anne Roff.

He is noted for his studies of specific resistance mechanisms that occur in particular and concomitant taxa of Acer of the family Lacerta and his work in the characterization of the acaryophytes from Elata, Oregon.  
 Snow was the first to study the thermal properties of specific glands of the leaves of Lamiaceae, and in the summer of 1939 he flew over the southeastern United States and studied the areas where bees were pollinating various crops. He discovered that bees mostly rely on leaf-gland heat exchange in support of reproduction and ant exchange.  
 Snow participated in the first Surgeon General ’ s Occupational Health Study to collect the `` pulse '' of tuberculosis patients. He was also involved in the establishment of Health Resources Division, serving as the Secretary and head of the Division for health care administration from 1942 to 1946.

 = Tristan Stenberg =  
Tristan Christopher Stenberg, ZTAGNA ( 15 November 1778 – 11 November 1863 ), was an Irish Catholic priest and mycologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Stenberg was born in Great Barrow near Wicklow, Ireland, then part of a parish called Bram All Quarries. His father was Dr. Robert Stenberg of Closeallsdale and a farmer from the Dunbar home there. His elder brother, also named Robert, was parish priest of Fhegna in County Kildare. Tristan was the second of three sons. His father died when he was nine years old. Tristan then attended St. Columba's Grammar School at the Westlimber Archdiocese of Kilkenny. On a study trip he received a scholarship from his parents to study at St. Peter's College, Cork. He had always been interested in mycology. His family then moved back to Sligo and his studies there were interrupted by World War I. He returned to Ireland and married Elizabeth Braithwaite in 1802. They had three sons. His first marriage was to Catherine Peebles, a University of Clare woman. He then moved to Ballina to study mathematics with William Andover Gregory. When he returned to Cork, he joined the University of Bantry in 1812 and took his doctorate from Cambridge in 1813.  
 In 1817 he moved to India and worked on various scientific papers, including one on the biotaxy of the common dwarf roseae.  
 He made a trip to Kilchangra, Western Ghats during the February-March of 1823, investigating the cold formation of Lake Kulkarni.  
   
 He was ordained a priest in St. Stephen's Basilica of Heidelberg in 1826. He taught physics, chemistry and mathematical sciences at the University of Adelaide.  
   
 In 1829 he left Adelaide and settled at Rathtinagar, Kootenay County, British Columbia.  
 He undertook field research in southwestern Saskatchewan ( south-central Alberta ), exploring the Crowsnest Pass. He became an authority on grizzly bear and cohoing population health, analysing captive specimens and early field releases. This work resulted in the introduction in British Columbia of the gray-headed bushy ground squirrel in 1829. He is credited with making a major contribution to the knowledge of the forest ground squirrels in the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and northern Quebec and the discovery of morphological and physiological similarities between North American black bears and species from the rainforest interior of southern Venezuela, although these similarities were probably false. He published on the identification of the Columbian lynx, being the first to name the land mammal.As a professor, he introduced mycology to Canada and to the United States, pioneering the study of fungi in mycology, which had previously been poorly studied and not well supported by the general public.  
 From 1831 to 1854 Stenberg worked at the botanical gardens of Toulouse, and in 1836 became curator at the New York Botanical Gardens.Stenberg died in August 1863 at Palms, New Mexico, and was buried in St. Luke's Churchyard, Carrick-on-Shannon.  
 He was the son of Robert Stenberg of Bunheran and Charlotte Catharine Stenberg. His sisters were Agnes, wife of the botanist M.C. Burt, and Bernice, wife of the botanist, W.R.C. Whitney.

 = Karl Saul Bockert =  
Karl Saul Bockert ( 25 September 1858, Copenhagen – 18 July 1917, Lemberg ) was a Danish neurologist, one of the founders of the neuropathology branch of the Swedish anatomical system, one of the most distinguished of the leading figures in the history of neurology, and one of the first psychologists to develop the concepts of human neurophysiology.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bockert was born in Copenhagen. He obtained his medical doctorate in 1894 and his neurology doctorate in 1898. From 1896 to 1898 he worked in the neurology department of the Odense University. From 1902 to 1905 he was an assistant at the Royal Veterinary Hospital and from 1905 to 1906 he was a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  
 From 1909 to 1918 he was director of the mental hospital of the Royal Orthopedic School, Copenhagen. He was the first Danish author to develop concepts of physiology in association with clinical problems ( in 1914 his book Symbolic Anatomy of the Brain as a Treatise of Diseases ). During the Second World War he moved to London to take up positions at the Hôpital Theoretical Institute and the Institute of Comparative Anatomy of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain.  
 After the war, Bockert devoted himself entirely to clinical research and began to focus on aspects of human brain anatomy. In 1904, the Chair of Neurology at the University of Copenhagen was created, and in 1924 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.  
 In 1919 he became the first professor of neurological pathology in Sweden. He served as the first president of the board of health of the Royal Norwegian Society for Neurology and Neurosurgery ( Norwegian : Kristiannekrående kirke fornar våldligt, for doctorologisch optik och och neuroptikar ), and he was a member of the Board of Neurological Research of the Swedish National Board of Health ( Norsk ). He was the medical superintendent of the Karls Region's Special Pediatric Unit of the Royal Pediatric Hospital in Gävle. Bockert and his son Gustaf Bockert Kinturkert founded the psychological hospital and hospital depts.  
 He died on 18 July 1917, the father of the Swedish neurologist Gustaf Bockert, who wrote the book Svenska stålligt ( The Pain-Relief Society ) in recognition of Bockert's contributions to psychology and neurology.

 == Biography ==  
 Moses Reinke was born in Sigdrup, Denmark in 1889. He was the son of Hermann Reinke, a member of the underground railroad system, and his wife, Rebekah Kay. He studied at the University of Copenhagen, receiving a doctorate in 1896.  
 In 1896, while still in Copenhagen, Reinke became a Lutheran pastor in Netreb utgård in Aalborg. Two years later, Reinke began publishing his theological works, under the pen name Manfred-Isaac Lenz. His discourses on theology in the Encyclopædia Britannica of the University of Copenhagen reached more than 250,000 copies. Reinke's work on the `` holy book '', the Holy Scriptures ( also known as The Berufganges Mysteriæ Encyclopædia Britannica ), was the first significant text-critical and text-critical textual study of the Old Testament. Other publications by him in the period were the commentary on Isaiah and the books of Esther and Jonah, the commentary on Psalm 145 ( 1894 ) and the commentary on Jonah, which also came under the pseudonym Lenz.  
 He spent the next three years in Germany, mainly in Berlin, before coming to Denmark in 1897. In 1897, he became a doctor of philosophy at the University of Copenhagen, and was then made dean of the Norwegian Faculty of Religious Education. He took part in a seminar on the ordeals of Judaism in Copenhagen in 1897. In 1900, he became the first priest in the church in Netreb, and served as rector from 1903 until 1906.  
 From 1908 he devoted himself to preaching the Gospel to the Jews of Denmark. In 1909 he was engaged in pastoral work at the General Synod of the Church of Denmark. In 1909 he became a member of the High Court of Justice and as a court judge, he published about 100 articles. He is known for writing the book The Great Mystery, in Danish. In 1912 he co-founded the Academic Council for Theological and Epistolic Culture.  
 In 1916 he was appointed minister of the Norwegian Church in Germany, and in 1920-22 he was acting president of the chapter of the congregation in Jerusalem. In 1925 he became head of the Norwegian Union in the All-Christian Union of the United Nations.After the Nansen movement ended in Germany, Reinke was invited to lead a conference in which he would attempt to find the Holy Grail. In 1934, he was forced to resign after an incident at the conference. He went on to teach at the University of Oslo. He died at his home in Kalmar in 1969.

She was a long-time member of the Soviet nuclear-weapons research group, and worked on the Sankt Rat and Sankt-Meitner potentials. She is credited with writing the code for developing the first non-mechanical device, an infrared locator, which she demonstrated at the Moscow State Institute of Science.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Antipova-Fey was born in Moscow on 4 May 1919. She studied physics and mathematics at the Moscow State Institute of Science. After receiving her doctorate she joined the Soviet nuclear-weapons research group where she worked on the Sankt Rat and Sankt Meitner potentials. The main invention of the group was the development of a chemical element called poisic sodium ( `` base '' ). She also invented an anti-microbial drug. While working on the Meitner potentials, Antipova-Fey developed a filter.  
 She was the first to solve the Sankt Rat problem, and her solution achieved the logarithmic degree of the orbitals of the atom of a poisic element. She made a method of measuring the ratio of the boiling point to the melting point of solids, and provided a direct answer for Meitner's equation and related problems.In 1975, Antipova-Fey became a widow after divorcing her first husband ( Evgeni Pavlovitch Pavlovich Antipov ), who had been the head of the work group on the Sankt Rat problem, on 10 January 1975. The next year, she became a widow. Antipova-Fey died in Moscow on 10 January 2008. She is buried at Pemstvo-1 cemetery, Moscow.Antipova-Fey is credited with writing the code for developing the first non-mechanical device, an infrared locator.

Richard Henreid de Zabel ( May 22, 1835 – April 12, 1915 ) was an American botanist and plant scientist who served as Director of the University of Texas Botanical Garden for over half a century.  
 De Zabel was born in East Trenton, New Jersey, the eldest of three sons. His brother, John Henreid de Zabel ( 1817-1887 ), was appointed as the first United States Commissioner to the Port of New York in 1858 and served with great distinction on the Stationery Office as acting Commissioner from 1861 to 1866. At the age of twenty-seven he graduated with a M.A. in 1865 from the University of Pennsylvania, then spent several years in Europe studying the flora and fauna of South and Central America and Alaska. In the meantime, however, his research and translations into German had been superseded by an equally thorough exposure in the English language of plants and other botanical subjects.  
 Following his college studies, he devoted himself to the study of plant pathology. In 1873 he was elected an associate of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, serving on its President's Committee of 1879. When its membership began to include academic scientists such as Leland Stanford, William G. Budge, Irving B. Bliss and Charles James Morris, he ran for its election. He was elected fellow in 1877, and in 1881 he was elected president of the Science Society of New York.De Zabel was one of the first to draw attention to the so-called dual study of plant physiology and morphology. His pioneering work on the chemical structure and physiological organization of lignin, mineral oil, epigallocatechin, cholesterol and cholesterol esters, particularly cholesterol esters, suggested the relation between the oxidation of cholesterol and the degradation of plant tissues, often called the progressive `` diathesis ''. He also developed the concept of irreversible changes of physicochemical properties, as in a process called biosynthesis.  
 He was especially interested in the relationships between plant pathology and the physiological processes involved in growth and maturation, and his exploration of the mechanisms of evolution by which plant tissues were altered was well received. He was largely responsible for the widespread knowledge of the fructification of the chalk plant, de Zabel's corolla, during the late 18th century.  
 He died from influenza on April 12, 1915.

Franz von Langlais ( 26 January 1635 – 21 April 1714 ), the Protestant theologian, was born in Sibley, near the Rhine, and went into the service of the Protestant Reformed Church from 1654 to 1671.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was the son of Stephan von Langlais, a teacher at the Reformed Gymnasium in Sibley, and his wife, Maria Gotthilf von Langlais. His father, like his mother, was a freethinker. His paternal grandfather, the priest Pietro Langlais, was a radical theologian and preacher in Neuen Artin.  
 At the age of six he was converted to the views of Luther. He obtained a preliminary university education in Sibley, and in 1655 undertook a course in theology with Samuel Koldenberg, whereupon he was ordained in 1658. His degree of Doctor of Divinity from the university, in August 1662, was probably due largely to his advocacy of the Reformed doctrines of justification by faith, free choice, and justification by faith alone, as opposed to the Calvinistic doctrines and dogmatics.  
   
   
 == Ecclesiastical career ==  
 He was for some years professor of philosophy in Neuen Artin, and in 1662 took up the rectorate of Duisburg. His theology had greatly improved, and he afterwards delivered the episcopal college sermon at the palace of Gotha. He was also indefatigable in the organization of churches. In 1672 he was appointed professor of theology at the imperial university of Bucharest, and a minister of the Church of Romania at Bucharest, from which he retired in 1694.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 His major works are the work De ibitur rectis doctrinae ( Erlangen, 1694 ), on the construction of the creed of justification, which was to become, in the course of its operations, the text of such Protestant treatises as Utrius Melanchthon and the works of Christoph Schlegel.

 In 1929, he appointed Ferguson as President of the Instituto de Estudios Economico-Universitaria, in recognition of his writings in economics, especially his book The Economics of the State ( 1938 ). In 1938, he gave a speech about the liberalization of Brazil's trade.  
 Ferguson's first appointment after the coup in 1948 was as Governor of Menaréna, then a constituent of São Paulo, in a government that made all the necessary changes to the economy to benefit the workers and peasants of the area. He saw it as a chance to construct an economic model for Uruguay that provided a progressive and effective progressive government for society, one that was linked to the needs of business, and that made it possible to reduce interference by bureaucratic bodies from government.  
 As minister of agriculture, he sought to repair the losses made by the rationing of imported goods. In 1941, he formed an agricultural committee, the so-called Ferme Commission, to promote agricultural reform, which included initiatives to increase the export of rubber and rubber products. He also played a part in laying the foundations for the creation of the first marine research center.  
   
   
 == Social insurance and poverty reduction ==  
 It was in this period of his career that he began to advocate for social insurance for the poor. In addition to this, his policies were affected by the government of Jorge Sáez Sánchez de Velez, with the politicians publishing debates within congresses in which they attempted to eliminate what they considered a deterioration in social conditions in the poor areas.In 1935, he proposed the concept of tax credits and assessments to the People's Alliance, a cooperative society of farmers, dockers, builders, employees and unemployed workers, to combat social inequality. He proposed these policies as a way to alleviate poverty, while also protecting the environment and raising profits from the trade of workers who were forced into the country. His policies were once again revised in 1942 to give the government greater influence over the agrarian movement.  
 He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1930 general election, following the political leader of that year, Evaristo Domingo Sommers, who died in office, with nine seats remaining. However, upon his withdrawal, his office became vacant due to no state funds being released for social insurance.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 In 1950, he retired to Chile, where he died in Concepción Villa De Stefano, close to the Soledad Mountains.

 = Thomas Dixon =  
Thomas Dixon ( January 22, 1817 – August 19, 1900 ) was an American Methodist missionary, whose name is sometimes mentioned in connection with Waddell's Watervliet.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Thomas Dixon was born near Jamestown, Virginia, about 1780, the son of Peter Dixon, a physician. On July 6, 1841, he entered College of William & Mary, one of the first colleges in Virginia to admit women. During his early years he went to Europe for studying, and enrolled at The Hague, where he soon gained acquaintance with its missionaries. During his second residence he became engaged in preaching. Shortly afterwards, a mission had been sent to England from the Dutch colony of Zeeland to the Dutch East India Company, and Dixon left to join it in his native country.  
 In the midst of his labors he was appointed an elder in the Baptist denomination at Concord, New Hampshire, and moved there in 1848. On his return he took charge of several Baptist missions in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Oregon, and throughout the territory received the fervent and professional support of the Baptists of the areas.  
 With the exception of two years, when in Maine he undertook missionary work in California, the travel in a merchant vessel took him throughout most of the coast of California, passing several times from Los Angeles to New York. He was left in the Southern Pacific Territory of the United States when a party of missionaries reached the Sandwich Islands. Dixon was appointed missionary-in-chief to the Sandwich Islands in 1855, and subsequently visited the Islands for several months, during which time he obtained the credit of having visited Cook's Island in New Zealand, a country which, however, was unknown to his predecessor, Thomas Martin McDougall, with whom he had little intercourse before. On this visit he wrote a letter to the United States President in July 1856, to request financial assistance in his mission to return the property of A. S. Van Alstyne, who had been broken in pieces by a storm, and had not been found. He preached at Washington on November 13, 1857, while in New England, and on that occasion recommended his wife, Adelaide, to act as his secretary and interpreter. During the following year he was at Fort McPherson in West Virginia, and preached in the Little Fort churches at Quaker Creek, Phillipsburg, Lebanon, and Winstead.  
   
   
 == Later years ==  
 In 1860, he was made one of the officers of a section of the Committee of Expeditions of the Southern Baptist Convention, and in 1866 transferred to Utah, where he became pastor of the First Baptist church of Logan City, near Logan, on the Missouri River. He was also for a time superintendent of the Missionary Trustees of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The result of his missionary work he recorded in 1877. During his last years of life he entered upon the arduous duty of reviewing the services of all the missionaries in the South Pacific. The condition of the missions was shown by his health, which gradually deteriorated.  
 Dixon died at Logan City, Utah, in 1900, in health free from disease. He was buried in the church cemetery of Logan.

 = Robert C. Woodhouse =  
Robert C. Woodhouse ( July 6, 1859 – October 9, 1944 ) was an American biologist known for his studies of fungi, plant diseases and pollination. He was a professor of botany and later director of the College of Agricultural Sciences in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Woodhouse was born in 1859 to Maria and Hamilton Woodhouse, who ran a funeral parlor. His father worked as a plumber, and his mother moved away with him to live with his family after the death of his father. He earned his bachelor's degree from Wisconsin Wesleyan College, and his Ph.D. in physiology from the University of Wisconsin in 1908. In 1909, he married Caroline Poncelet, who was born in Mexico. They moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1910, where they lived for the next eight years. They would remain there for the rest of his life.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After graduating from Wisconsin Wesleyan College, Woodhouse went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked in zoology and biology, eventually becoming a staff research botanist and resident botanist at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1916, he was promoted to assistant professor of biology at the college, where he later became a full professor in 1919.  
 In his career, Woodhouse identified many plant diseases that had important role in aiding the livestock industry, and helped create a biorepository of wheat fields. During World War I, he participated in the Great Lakes Research Project, and helped develop an experimental mill and a chemical fertilizer in Minnesota. From 1925, Woodhouse served as head of the Department of Botany at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he took over as chair from 1926 to 1938.  
   
   
 == Scientific achievements ==  
 During the first half of the 20th century, Woodhouse's work on phytotaxonomy laid the groundwork for a new approach for understanding phytotaxonomy in the western United States. Woodhouse was well known for his unorthodox approach to phytotaxonomy that involved asking the questions `` What is life? '' rather than `` What is happening? ''. He also pursued questions like : `` Is it related to the flowering times? '' and `` What is some characteristic morphological characteristic in fungi? '' After studying plants for decades, his work in the field of phytotaxonomy soon caught the attention of botanists around the world. He began publishing papers in an international scientific journal, American Journal of Botany, in 1920, and published a series of five papers, as well as a series of articles in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. He also published several papers on chemical plants. Many of his published works include the first description of Boulengeria mimosa. This moss, discovered in 1980, is often referred to as `` the coleopteran of the genus Woodhouse's plants. ''  
 Woodhouse was a pioneer of the field of flora ecology, along with Aron Feinberg, Henry Stockton-Blatt and Al C. Milliken, and is also credited with creating the microbial fungi taxonomy. He coined the term `` microbial floras '' in 1948, when he described the macroflora of various woody vascular plants as the coleopteran system and studied the malacological communities and feeding habits of the fungus.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 In 1924, he received the Charles Babbage Medal of the Royal Society of London.

 = Frits Siebert =  
Frederick Frits Siebert ( 20 September 1872 – 6 May 1943 ) was a Swedish geologist, geophysicist, and Nobel laureate. He was the first person to demonstrate the existence of large earthquakes in Europe, and the first to establish that continental crust is distinct from oceanic crust.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Siebert was born on 20 September 1872 in Stockholm and was a son of Frederick Wilhelm Siebert, the mining engineer who had come to Stockholm in 1882. His younger brother Wilhelm is buried in Oakmore, Church Street Cemetery. He attended school in Berlin and received a doctorate from the University of Göttingen.  
 Siebert took a position as a teacher at the Old State Vocational School ( now the Konservatorium ) in 1892. He got a job at the Mining Corporation, Kristiansand, Norway, in 1896 and was a member of the mining inspection team there from 1900 to 1910. In 1906, he became mining geologist at the petroleum production company in Gothenburg. In September 1907, he was named assistant geologist to the director of the institute for petroleum operations in Åbo by the government, with a focus on petroleum products. At the same time, he was created director of the Natural Resources Institute ( forerunner of the Norwegian Institute for Water Resources ) in Gotha. During 1911, he left for France to take up a position as a staff geologist at the Moroccan Petroleum Company in Cairo. From this position, he began to conduct geological and climatological investigations on the Mediterranean Sea ( especially Spitsbergen and Tobruk ). He returned to Sweden in 1915, during the Second World War. In 1919, he was appointed secretary-general of the Norwegian Institute for Research in Geology, and in 1930 became director. During his tenure, he funded many investigations into the geology of oil reserves in Greenland, and had a major impact on oil exploration. In 1927, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics `` for his extensive field studies of the geology of the Norwegian shelf and the geology of oil and gas in the Mediterranean Sea, and for his ability to produce scientific papers in English ''. He died in Gothenburg on 6 May 1943, from cancer.

 = Knut N. Schäfer =  
Dr. Knut N. Schäfer ( 28 July 1868 – 5 June 1937 ) was a Danish microbiologist and pathologist.  
 He was born in København in 1868 and was the son of a shipyard owner. He studied law at Uppsala University, studying chemistry, and medicine, during which time he became head of the bacteriology unit at Uppsala Institute of Biology ( now Uppsala University Hospital ).  
 Schäfer received his doctorate in 1887 and his Ph.D. in 1891. In 1895, he published two papers on inoculation with bacteria from a dead sheep and in 1897 he identified a specific type of iron bacterium at the end of a long chain. He received a professorship at Uppsala University in 1907 and was appointed professor of bacteriology. In 1914, Schäfer joined the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences as professor and served as dean of the school until 1932.  
 In 1912, he contributed to a German virology textbook on tuberculosis based on a periodical article that described sera collected from patients with hyperthermia. This work led to a special reference in 1924 describing the immunological features of tuberculosis ( xenograft materials and the interrelationship between DNA and proteins, primers, polyglutamine and proteins ).

 = Henry Bartlett Newton =  
Henry Bartlett Newton ( August 14, 1862 – October 5, 1939 ) was an American economist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Newton was born in Lexington, Massachusetts to Elizabeth and Charles Newton. He was educated at the Technical High School in Boston, graduated from Harvard University in 1884, and taught economics and statistics for 12 years at New England School.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Newton began working on bank returns and unemployment insurance during the depression of the early 1890s. In 1891, at a public meeting in Boston, he suggested that the federal government continue to subsidize insurance, and its revenue had to be increased to pay for it. Newton also criticized the crisis of industrial relations in Great Britain for its absence of a clear union of labor and capital.  
 During the First World War, he served as director of the United States Institute of Industrial Relations, a New England division of the League of Nations.  
 Newton earned a Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1893, and a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1896.  
 His theory of the tendency to create false, but disfavored, alternative goods, titled the Newtonian diffusion, is sometimes known as `` modern '' desirability bias.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Newton held a chair in the Department of Economic and Political Sciences at the University of Chicago from 1891 to 1898 and from 1900 to 1903, and he served as professor of economics and political science at Brown University from 1904 to 1908. He also served as secretary to the Board of Trustees of Brown University from 1907 to 1908 and as its provost from 1907 to 1911. He also was the first President of the U.S. Naval Association and the first President of the Economic Club of Chicago.  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 Newton is best known for his theory of the tendencies to create false, but disfavored, alternatives goods, called the Newtonian diffusion, and he developed this theory and accepted the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1897. Newton believed that tax-exempt foundations could raise adequate funds to support studies of the correct production and sale of goods.In the field of economic theory, the Newtonian diffusion occurs when what would otherwise be socially desirable must now be produced or sold. Newton coined the term `` Newtonian fallacy '', in honor of the theoretical physicist in a sermon delivered in Boston in 1893. The idea was that, `` the good that could have caused the fame of King Ludwig XIV but did not cause him to run off to live abroad, was of an uninteresting nature. '' For example, a high school field trip is more probable than that of a teacher. This is a consideration that can lead to misguided decisions and social interactions.  
 He was the first president of the American Statistical Association ( ASA ) and the first president of the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ). He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( AAS ) and the American Academy of Political and Social Science ( AAPSS ).  
 Newton is widely considered one of the foremost economists in the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Influence on American life ==  
 With Thomas Mann he introduced the concept of a stationary stock of knowledge. It is based on the premise that knowledge alone will always lead to optimal exchange rates. Newton developed this theory with Francis C. Stephens and the subject of Great Depression came to be known as cyclical adjustment.

 = Dirk-Jules Dermet =  
Dirk-Jules Dermet ( also Dirk Jules Dermett, 1888–1962 ) was a Belgian-Canadian mathematician, a prominent exponent of the Euclidean-Geometric theory, and the author of many algebraic and mathematical papers.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Dermet was born in Brefeld, where his father, Paul Dermet, was pastor. His parents wanted him to attend the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music, so he studied music theory and composition under Pierre Rolland, but he preferred to pursue mathematics. His professor, Vincenzo Valchek, helped recruit him as a mathematician and Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics. He earned his Ph.D. in 1913 from Johns Hopkins University, where he was a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences. While working at Johns Hopkins, he assisted Marcel Fougère with his work on quaternions, and worked with Alexander C. Maurer. He was also member of the APM Le Comptes Rendus Compositionse et Mathematique de France. He received the Gold Medal of the Mathematical Society of Edinburgh and the first membership in the Le Comptes Rendus Compositionse. He was appointed co-secretary for the Mathematical Institute of the Royal Norwegian Academy of Sciences in 1944, and his proposers were Dietrich Swank and Lise Skovgaard.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Dermet studied theorems of the norm and that are relativized to a variety of symmetric forms, and generalized principal and sum of ordinary differential equations on quaternions.He is sometimes cited as being the `` father of the Euclidean calculus '' ( a variation of algebraic geometry, where Euclidean geometry is a certain number of absolute terms, a starting point for all subsequent topics ).  
   
   
 === Euclidean geometry ===  
 Dermet formulated the principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives. According to Haack, Dermet was motivated by `` his desire to understand not only the fixed-point planes of a plane without surface or volume, but what is tangentially symmetric in a plane with both ''. His principle of the equal treatment of surface and volume derivatives allows for generalization of the differential equations of Maxwell's equations. According to D. G. Smith, the mathematical proofs of these equations allow for universal extension of all mathematical theory to a third dimension.  
 Dermet defined the `` Lassen '' triangle by extending the Euclidean rules to these three special case triangles. This triangle is the third most common triangle that contains a circle.  
   
   
 === First-order functional analysis ===  
 Dermet devised and extended earlier work on functional analysis, for which he is often called `` founder of functional analysis ''. It provides the foundation for the applicability of mathematical methods in functional analysis, a priority he dedicated to his collaborators Leon Balabanov and Silvio Nardi in 1931. Dermet established the basis for an understanding of the notion of linear algebra. Many mathematicians in his time believed that algebraic structure is linear if and only if the basic rules governing differential equations are observed. Dermet's work demonstrates that this is false. This work was widely known at the time and proved in several papers before Dermet's death in 1962.

 == Biography ==  
 Addison was the son of Samuel Addison ( 1748–1834 ), a cloth manufacturer, and Elizabeth ( née Ashton ), daughter of the merchant Benjamin Ashton. In 1839, his elder brother was elected local vicar ; a year later, a brother-in-law became vicar ; in 1842, William moved to Naples, Italy, where he was vicar of Pavia from 1848 until 1856, when he was sent by the Curia to Rome. While there, Addison wrote his first books, which advocated conversion from Roman Catholicism to the Anglican communion ( now a separate religion ).  
   
 Addison's interest in reforming Catholicism was at the height of its renaissance in Italy in the early 1840s. His denunciation of Roman Catholicism as `` the filth and sloth of Rome '' caused the Bishop of Turin, Massimo Varese, to rebuke him, and Addison's plea for `` a definite and independent religious creed '' caused him to be included in the first of several Accademia dei Lincei revocati in 1844.In the following years he became an advocate of Anglicanism ; his assertion that his own views were socially liberal was ridiculed, and with the conversion of the wealthy Vezzano family, Addison became `` dean of the civic chapel in Turin, which, with its ecclesiastical privileges, makes him among the foremost authorities on modern Italian literature. ''  
 He was a fierce opponent of the order's separation from Rome, and his idea of `` radical independence '' ( also used in English with the title `` radical Protestantism '' ), due to his opposition to Rome's ecclesiastical structures and its tendency to centralize power, led many Roman Catholics to point to him as the prime supporter of their views. But it was not always so. He was a critic of his brother James Addison's Realism, also known as Non-religious Liberals, who held to what he called `` a quasi-devotional '' spiritual dimension.  
   
 He is sometimes referred to as the father of modern feminism, and is best known as the editor of Feminism and Modernity, and feminist religious figure Kate Millett, who wrote poetry from Addison's perspective. In contemporary English-language `` feminist writers '' he is sometimes called `` Addison-Gilmore '', and perhaps `` Gottlieb Johnson ''.

 = John S. A. L. Johnson =  
John S. A. L. Johnson ( 26 January 1879 – 10 January 1941 ) was an American zoologist, mycologist, botanist, and lecturer on entomology.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Waterville, New York, and attended Waterville High School. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in natural sciences from the University of Wisconsin in 1905, and a master's degree in zoology in 1908. He taught biology at Emory University, Bakersfield, California, from 1910-12 and the U.S. Army Medical Corps in Germany in 1912.  
 He returned to the U.S. and was appointed an associate professor of biology at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington in 1915.  
 Johnson then joined a laboratory as a fellow of Cornell University and, in 1918, was named curator of the new Department of Zoology, Cornell University.Johnson went on to teach biology in a wide variety of institutions and become known as a leading authority on mycology and fungi, an area that fascinated him greatly.He died on 10 January 1941, at the age of 79.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 During his fieldwork, he spent the last 11 years of his life documenting the insect taxonomy of northern Mexico and Central America, and his collections were acquired for the University of Washington Museum of Comparative Zoology. He edited the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History's Review of Mycology in 1916-17, and collaborated with their colleague Wilfred G. Wing as an editor. In 1932 he married Sarah Howard White and moved to Renton, Washington. He had two children. His papers are held at the University of Washington's Museum of Comparative Zoology. His main papers are illustrated in the Mycological Bulletin.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Johnson was the author of several books and articles on mushrooms. He wrote papers on bacterial and fungal families, including the zoophytes Linsoiraceae ( called `` Teck '' in Japanese ) and Bactria. He was the co-author of the Mycological Encyclopedia with Eugene James Gepp and L.J. Rediker of Cornell University, 1915. He was also a contributor to the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History's Review of Mycology. The Journal of the Mycological Society of America published a two-part series, Mutual Recognition of Species, Vol. II, in 1945, which focused on biotechnology as a contributor to biodiversity and was `` much admired '' by the group's president.  
 His other notable works include The Cachylioidea of Utah and their Distribution in Oklahoma ( 1910 ), mycology and hiscology in a Rural Arizona Area ( 1917 ), and A Naturalist's Guide to the Mazatec : Contributions to Mycology ( 1923 ). A short-term monograph titled The Löwenhoek Bug ( Campylobacter duodenale – Ishida serovarum ) ( 1928 ) discusses C. duodenale and other early Mycobiaceae.  
   
   
 == Family life ==  
 Johnson was married to Lillian Oppenheim, whom he had met in 1902. He was a husband-and-wife team, and was deeply influenced by his wife's natural science. They had two daughters, Camilla I.B. Johnson and Mary A.W. Johnson. They had two sons, James and David.

 = Hans Hauser =  
Hans Hauser ( 26 June 1861 – 17 January 1949 ) was a German composer. He was a son of Ludwig Hauser and an older brother to Wolfgang.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Hauser was born on 26 June 1861 in Göttingen, to Ludwig Hauser ( 1840–1910 ) and Maria Hauser ( 1840–1911 ), sister of Georges Hauser, a state minister. Hauser's father was a minister of state in Leipzig and was from a non-practicing Jewish family. He had first heard music and began composing at the age of seven.  
   
   
 === Musical education ===  
 In 1894, he entered the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Leipzig, where he studied violin and composition. From 1907 onwards, he studied a classical style known as `` fulltone '' with his elder brother, Wolfgang. Their influences, especially those of the Vienna Circle, were strong, which led to a passionate interest in music and works of literature.In 1913, Hauser received his doctorate in composition under the direction of Bernd Heinrich Schäffer. From 1916 to 1919 he taught composition at the Leipzig Conservatory. It was during his study of the Vienna Circle that his first writing, the Hungarian Early Great Works ( 1928 ), appeared. He had since heard the work with great interest, so was in the habit of offering criticism.Hauser also took the chance to study with the renowned pianist Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the violinist Carl Adolph Schoenberg. These students were key figures in his artistic development.  
   
   
 == Poetry ==  
 Hauser was one of the best known Polish-language poets of the last decades of the 19th century. His earliest works were published in Hóra, a large literary magazine founded in 1912 in Polish-occupied Austria. Since Hauser worked at the same time as the Polish poet Horia Kopłościeńský, the poets'poet was known for his lively and poetic style. However, despite being an idealist and the idealist being under constant siege by these poets'idealism, Hauser taught his poetry in a manner open to all students of French-language culture.Kopłościeńský used to call Hauser `` the real soprano '' ( a portmanteau of `` real '' and `` opera '' ). Hauser was also well known for writing on music in Vienna. The poet's visit to Vienna in 1910 gave him an intimate knowledge of all aspects of Hungarian music. They fell out during the Hungarian Civil War because of Hauser's attachment to the National Liberal Party.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Between 1906 and 1918, Hauser composed music for films such as Monty Python's The Meaning of Life and The Godfather. His earlier works are considered among the finest in his repertoire. Some of his earliest work of operatic composition, i.e. works for orchestral purposes, is Tannhäuser-Klein im bekannten ( Tannhäuser's Opera for 15 Children, written after taking part in a St. Petersburg Festival in 1881 ), with the title variation of Passacaglia, and is arguably one of the finest in operatic composition ever written. This is followed by Tannhäuser-Schule, organ music for evening performances. Other pieces from the 1920s, such as the overture Heifetz and the oboe Concerto, were written before the increasing interest in musical theatre, and are clearly dedicated to the budding ballet traditions of Austria.

 = Herbert Edgar Jordan =  
Herbert Edgar Jordan ( March 17, 1923 – December 23, 2004 ) was an American pastor, writer, and anthropologist. He was also the President of Emmanuel AME, a Congregational church in Houston.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Jordan was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. His father, a military commander, supported him throughout his youth.Jordan graduated from high school at a time when the politics and culture of the time shaped many young American men. The Vietnam War put an end to that formative experience and the racial tensions that it generated took priority over college. Jordan completed his undergraduate degree at University of Nebraska–Lincoln ( U. of L. ) in 1954, which he obtained with a B.A. degree in political science.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Jordan spent most of his professional life in the field of theology, arguing for biblical continuity, the emphasis of spiritual and historical theology on relational theology, and the family as a location of potential change, especially for marginalized and disenfranchised groups. He served as head of the Department of Religions, at the North Texas Community Church, as well as a pastor in a number of other Congregational churches. While at Emmanuel AME, Jordan chaired the book clubs and the mission committee for the church's 11th Harvest Moon's Conference in 1980, resulting in groups being created that invited readers to create their own kinds of homilies. These workshops were later published as `` Spiritual Philanthropy : Church Taxation and Contribution to Race, Sexuality, and Class Struggle ''.The most significant venture for which Jordan was known was the Rev. Michael Palmer-Jones's Challenge to Christology, which challenged traditional models of what can be and what can not be within scripture. For Jordan, Challenging Christology is a work of Christian witness, to reconcile his theological position with his experience as an African-American educator. As such, it can provide an introduction to and process for the emerging social theology of reconciliation and intercultural action.  
 Jordan served as the first African-American president of the World Council of Churches in the 1950s. He was a major figure in the African-American civil rights movement and served as a state representative. In addition, Jordan was a central figure in the failure to construct the Weather Underground and the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a founder of the Black Christian Leadership Council, and is known for his song, `` Write Your Whole Life '', and his evangelical study group formation programs.  
 In the 1990s Jordan published on his experiences in Memphis, Tennessee, at that city's Coleman Academy. In that study group, he emerged with a set of ideas for some of the church community's challenges and better conditions for ministry among a number of ethnic minorities in South Memphis. Over the next decade, Jordan wrote several books on the ways in which churches can change behavior and change programs in ways that impact the problems facing African-American communities. One such program is the Community Action Research Center ( CAMC ) in Marda, Mississippi, which Jordan helped found in 2002. This center brings together ministries, faith communities, civil rights organizations and black leaders in Memphis to analyze and synthesize information and action.  
 Jordan died of lung cancer in 2003 at the age of 79.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 Jordan received an Outstanding Teaching Award from South Central Methodist University ( 1979 ).  
 Jordan was honored by the Leadership Conference of Women Religious ( LCWR ) as the `` father of African-American church leadership ''.  
 Jordan was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the World Council of Churches ( WCC ) in 1995.  
 Jordan was named a recipient of the American Council on Church & State's `` Leadership in Community Service '' award.  
 Jordan was named the 14th and most senior African-American recipient of the ACOG Award for distinguished service by African Americans in Christian service, sponsored by the West-South Asia Center.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Jordan was identified as 'one of the leading church leaders of the last 20 years,'noted ABCNEWS.com.

 = Johannes Schmidt =  
Johannes Schmidt ( 8 November 1652 – 20 July 1722 ) was a German geographer, cartographer and map maker.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He studied theology at Munich and was ordained as a pastor. The eminent scholar Heinrich Weiss ( 1631–1682 ) followed his decision and, on 10 April 1688, was called to the bar of the Archduke of Hesse. It was immediately to his credit that he was entrusted with the task of drawing the map of Hesse on a larger scale than that which had been previously undertaken. Thereafter he worked on such works as a co-writer with Johannes Cosmas Pötter, and on the manuscript of Proklar of Franconia and Deuget, as well as on other maps. He was a member of the Societas guild for eight years and by his conduct won public favour. In 1695, at the age of seventy-six, he published : Johan Schmidt Bücher, in profesor ( His old age ) ( 1702 ), an essay on the politics of his native Saxony.  
 Schmidt had inherited wealth in the cities of Stettin, Novgorod, and St. Petersburg. He succeeded Hans Wenzel as rector of Innsbruck in 1717. As a geographer he contributed to the commentary on the Codex Brit. Libr. 1685, the geographical description of the Saxon kingdom. He contributed to the German Catalogue, published in 1718, the Historia Morbicala IX., pp. 295–297 ; and the Goethes-Gymnasium Dresden-Johanne Schmidt, with Maps of New Saxon Grammar, of Antiquities in Use in that Kingdom ( 1722 ), etc. Besides the small selection of his writings on politics, he wrote many articles in the Zentralblatt der Meddelelser, and contributed significantly to the Berliner Geographik.  
 Schmidt is known for his much-publicised and prolific translation of the Swedish Grammar, especially of the first part. A few pages of his dissertation appeared as an appendix in the Cambridge grammar, and subsequent work. This has caused great confusion, as it was widely read in libraries.  
 His other best-known work, his history of Stettin, published under the title Schechter der reichenstelle Innsbruck, appeared in 1726 ; it covered almost all the counties in that province, and the journeys which the crew made there during 1704–1705, the voyage of the principal vessel for that voyage being captured and burned by the imperial troops. His other important work, based on the fact of the original inhabitants in Aryan languages being Scandinavians, was recently added to the history of the island and by appointment of the King of Sweden as a botanist and hermit of his great nephew, King Wilhelm II of Prussia, whose royal collection had been placed in Danzig ; the history is in the possession of a Saxon widow of that name.  
 His map collection is in the London museum, and was in good state until the long illness of his only son, Johannes Schmidt, which necessitated his death on 20 July 1722.

 = Paul Runnemann =  
Paul Rünemann ( 18 August 1893 – 30 November 1963 ) was an Austrian psychologist and an expert in mysticism.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Paul Rünemann was born in Landshut, but grew up in Vienna, and then in Berlin and Leipzig. After a high school education at the Reichenberg Gymnasium, he joined the University of Vienna. In 1919 he entered the rectorship of the St. Thomas More Abbey and was ordained in the name of St. Thomas himself. After this he worked as a teacher in the Reichenberg Rhenish Conservatory. In 1922 he moved to London, where he was hired by the London Society of Science and Art. After leaving the British Society for Psychical Research he worked as an editor of the Journal of Mind and Nervous Attraction. In 1929 he was named the Institute Professor of Psychology and Scientism at the University of Leipzig.  
   
   
 == Professional life ==  
 Rünemann spent many years as a teacher, journalist, and tutor in Vienna. He joined the editorial staff of the journal Optik und Psychik and is best known for his studies of the effect of the influence of extreme social pressure on the mind. In 1926 he published The Pure Mind : The Creative Eye of Heaven. This book was written from an extreme theoretical point of view. He advocated a mystical/empirical spirit as a distinctive faculty in the human mind. He believed the mental creations, and the consciousness or cosmic manifestation of the world, could be understood in terms of the unconscious mind, the esoteric emanations of the human soul, and the purely materialistic experience of the work of the spirit. Rünemann was a friend of Wilhelm Reich and wrote his story of Wilhelm Reich from Rünemann's point of view, which was used by Reich in his theosophical experiments and which resulted in Reich's death from a suicide attempt in 1936. In his essays in Psychology and Psychical Research he maintained that the major problem with current psychology was that it was not concerned enough with the cognitive element. This was felt to be out of step with the mystical aspects of nature, thus leading to a degradation of mysticism and pseudogamy. Rünemann strongly held that religious activity must be done according to the mystical rites of the times, and strongly opposed any attempt to substitute psychological science with that of material science.

 = John Yew =  
John Yew ( May 13, 1871 – April 8, 1933 ) was a New Zealand diplomat, economist, politician and philanthropist, as well as a pioneering campaigner for early childhood education.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 John Yew was born in the parish of Lygon in Worcestershire in England to Robert Yew, a Scottish soldier and Mary Louise Green, and was educated at the Royal Charter School in Edinburgh. He graduated in 1891 with a BSc and first class honours degree in economics from Cambridge.  
   
   
 == Diplomatic career ==  
 Yew became Secretary of State for Finance from 1901 until 1924.  
 From 1924 to 1934, he served as MP for Plymouth, Plymouth and Devonport, and for Hull and Malling ( wasldld ) from 1934 to 1935. He later served as Treasury Minister.  
   
   
 === Politics and social welfare ===  
   
   
 === Strategy in education ===  
 Yew wanted to address the fundamental problems facing England by promoting early childhood education. He opposed the and social guidance – the teachers did not have a clue what was going on in their classrooms, but came to the lessons wanting to make the students understand things. In the 1920s, Yew introduced national early childhood education guidelines and pupils were encouraged to study the ancient languages of Greece, Latin, Chinese, Latin, Syriac, Egyptian and Syriac, and to read Latin, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew and Hebrew poetry.  
 Yew introduced national education plans in different parts of the country, initially in London and later in Plymouth, Plymouth and Devonport. Yew supported the local government action which guaranteed funding for public schools and set an example for districts by mandating that every child had access to breakfast, lunch and three hours of gymnasium every day. The government also abolished the forced serving of food on Fridays and Christmas Eve in the majority of schools.  
 Through his influence, Plymouth District School Board and the city of Plymouth United spent considerable sums on resources for the early childhood and high school systems.  
   
   
 === Small change ===  
 Yew was also concerned about the impact of the first world war on the country's war industries. From 1931 to 1939 he was involved in research into fighting in Greece. During his time in Malta he worked to combat the Japanese menace. He was worried that money spent on the war could only be used in the next war. As a result he offered personal funds to buy the Macedonian Iron Company's Ironhead.  
   
   
 === Postwar ===  
 Yew was now involved in other concerns, including providing financial support for survivors of war and a contribution to the reconstruction of civilian housing, especially at a time when many casualties had resulted from bombing and sabotage, when few families had a home.  
   
   
 == Personal life and death ==  
 John Yew married Augusta Golightly in 1901, and moved with her to Whitehaven in Cornwall. They had two sons and a daughter. John Yew died in 1933. He is buried in Sutton Coldfield Cemetery, Plymouth.

Arthur Samuel Hutton ( 9 October 1867 – 21 June 1933 ) was a Tasmanian zoologist and botanist. He was born in Ross Tasman, Tasmania. He went to school in Coffs Harbour where he studied at the Botany Department until 1880. He worked for three years in the Botany Department of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne and Melbourne University. In 1880 he moved to the city of Bondi and became assistant to the keeper of the city zoo at Bondi. He made his first scientific discovery in 1888, on a dried foot of mole snake, `` Grundlandi pisum '' or bed-nose leopard snake. In 1893 he came across the Antarctic fish, Diverticula rivasionis, when digging the petroleum fired lighthouse at Murchison Point, in the station at Bondi, to collect fossils for the Zoological Society of London. After 1892, he worked as the zoologist of the Kingsbury Zoo. In 1895, he published The Worm Nest of a King Neptune and Tropical Albatross, in which he described about 200 species.  
   
 Hutton described several species of rhea, their eggs ( the larvae ) and fetuses, and also a genus he described as `` West tropheria '' or Starfish. Hutton also collected plants. He described the fungal genus Hadruplozone and the pollen genus Mausomia, which is a collection of African and Asian plant species including saplings, berries, seeds, snails, pear trees, succulents, dried seaweeds and cardboard packets.He and his wife, Emily Redson, moved to Ross Tasman in 1889 when they came into conflict with the adjoining Woolworths'store as the local traders demanded cattle and harddrink supplies. After returning to Melbourne in 1891, he worked with Henry Moore, a Tasmanian pioneer entomologist. The couple lived in Hamilton until they died in Berlin in 1931.

Frederic van der Zuyten ( Dutch : [ ʀɑ̃tɑ̃dɐ ] ; 1831–1892 ) was a Dutch economist who is noted for introducing in 1850 the label Krampf keframofricus ( `` Keframorefo service '' ). The Krampf was the prototype of the `` hut hut '', a modern-day property in the Dutch housing market. The Krampf was in turn one of the two or three highest rated Dutch housing markets in the early 19th century. It is also noted as one of the main obstacles in achieving urban planning.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 van der Zuyten was born in Liège. Although he had considerable technical and personal experience in literature and education, in the long run, he did not stick to his profession for long, instead joining a private firm and becoming a partner of a landowner in Dijon, in the south of the country. After the fall of the Iron Crown, he moved to Brussels, where he resided for the rest of his life and was eventually one of the important persons who helped to break the wall between Brussels and the countryside. During that period he organized several hundred agricultural guilds in Belgium. In 1862 he died and was buried in the Dutch town of Leuven.

 = Udo Perl =  
Udo Perl ( 10 December 1875, Kiel – 24 September 1951, Frankfurt am Main ) was a German physicist and inventor. He made important contributions in the field of electrical engineering, optics, and magnetism. His invention of the valve valve, which eliminated the need for valves and other complicated mechanical operations in electricity production, led to the industrial application of mechanical valve operating systems.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Perl's mother died when he was three years old, after which his father returned to Germany and was sent to study at the University of Kiel. He studied engineering at the newly created Technische Hochschule in Hamburg, during which he designed an early motor vehicle, and then for the remainder of his academic career studied mechanical engineering at the University of Heidelberg. He returned to Kiel in 1911 to study engineering. After gaining his Ph.D. in 1920, he worked at the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft ( DPG ) in Berlin, becoming a Privatdozent in 1926. There he was part of an electronic experiment-group, where he formulated the principle of the perihelion flow ( which he independently demonstrated in 1916 ), which allowed the dynamic regulation of transformers to be used for control. From 1928 to 1932, Perl was also professor of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering at Kiel.  
 In 1925 Perl received his Ph.D. from Kiel, but was kept from it by prohibition legislation in Germany. Instead, he was placed in a Theresienstadt internment camp, for eight months during which he worked on digital circuits for Siemens in Leipzig. In 1928 he went to work at the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft ( DPG ) in Berlin as a Privatdozent, and remained there until 1949. There he was involved in research into transmission electron microscopes, infrared detection and control systems, and radar.  
   
   
 == Work in Germany ==  
 On 27 March 1939, at the opening of the Second World War, Perl was drafted into the Allied Armed Forces. He was interned in Sachsenhausen, Germany. On 8 May, the Nazis arrested him and stripped him of all his possessions, including his car, and sent him to a camp in Ravensbrück, where he remained for three months before being sent to the Nazi concentration camp of Jömno for six months. After being liberated by the Soviets on 5 June 1941, he then transferred to the Rhine-Eisenach Military Hospital where he was interned until the end of World War II.  
 Perl's nuclear research career took off from there. In the late 1950s he developed an early apparatus for magnetically levitating a tablet using spark flux, using an aluminium stick to force the structure to bend, the same kind of technique that had been used in experimenting with magnetism in diamonds.Later work on magnetrons started in Germany, by Wilhelm Hsieh. Perl played a key role in applying magnetrons to ferroelectric circuitry, but with a very small yield. Perl proposed a method that used large, silent, and static sparks to generate complex magnetic fields, such as magnetic fields around a solid source. He demonstrated this at a theoretical level in 1958 in the paper `` A prototype magnetic superhydrophobe '', which he presented at the European Physical Society meeting in Leipzig. He also worked on using magnetic fields to generate light with superconductors.  
   
   
 == Later life and legacy ==  
 Perl died on 24 September 1951, at the age of 75, in Frankfurt am Main.

 = Rudolph Stefan-Gut =  
Rudolph Stefan-Gut ( 14 May 1876 – 19 March 1959 ) was a Jewish-Germans political scientist, proponent of the Franz Boas theory of history, founder of eugenics and the founder of the Racial Studies Association ( HRA ) in the Netherlands.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Gut was born in East-Prins on 14 May 1876. He studied at the Universities of Göttingen and Leipzig and received his doctorate from Göttingen in 1925. His doctoral thesis, Karl Heinrich Röchlicher Gesellschaft, was written under the direction of Rudolf Steiner. In his book Geschichte der entde – or `` History of the Intelligence of Man '', Gut proposes that a knowledge of the long-term state and history of racial intelligences is an essential prerequisite for successfully understanding modern societies. The book is still relevant today. The book has found a wider readership through the continuing analysis and publication of several more recent books by the award-winning eugenicist and self-proclaimed expert on racial genetics Fred Pearson and academic editor Jürgen Trusendli.  
 At the same time, in 1926, Gut founded the Jewish Scientific Society ( Nordhausselstverteidigungsprogrammationsgemeenschaft ) in the Netherlands, which publishes several textbooks on sociological genetics.  
 Gut was an important promoter of eugenics, which played a key role in the founding of the racial sciences, of which the heritage-based views on human race are a staple in history-sociology. He argued that hereditary laws govern human behavior, and that the intellectual and cultural environment of the children of one single racial group can best explain their general behavior. In an opinion piece published in the Zeit newspaper, Gut strongly supported Eugenics by Eugen Bleuler ( 1850–1932 ). His position changed after his death. In 1971, The Jewish Scientific Society defended its original position, and published an open letter to critics and supporters of the eugenic teaching methods.  
 Rudolf Gut was a member of the executive committee of the International Commission for the Scientific Study of the Race ( ISR ) and served on its scientific advisory council.  
 The Racial Studies Association ( HRA ) was established in the Netherlands in the 1960s under the presidency of Jan Brose, with an annual budget of about 25 000 Korvarts. The HRA publishes Handbuch zur Biologie und eugenicwissenschaft ( Historical and Eugenic Biology ) and Racenet ( Race and Social Information ) ( 1976 ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Gut married Alice Wegener in 1902 and had one daughter, Naomi.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 A reader reviews this text, describing the following :  
 `` Gut's work, which is profoundly empirical and quite very complete... took place during a period during which eugenics and racist ideas were widely accepted. In his book, Rudolf Steiner and Gustave Flaubert also made statements about populations which were applicable to the native nations of Europe. Fritz Springmeier tried to explain why Africans ’ utopia, for example, was not accepted in Germany. ''  
   
   
 == Views and legacy ==  
 Friederike Haerland wrote a rebuttal in Human Culture and Psychology in The Human Soul, a number of later scholarly reviews and critiques about Rudolf Gut's views on racism and eugenics, and in The Erasmus Review, where Haerland accused her editor of being an anti-Semitic bigot, `` [ A ] number of current and former schoolteachers and political experts, including Steiner and others at the university, as well as some prominent members of the Dutch public, have characterized Gut's work on the Continent as reprehensible, destructive and pedagogical poison. ''  
 Another controversial period in Rudolf Gut's career, is considered as part of his debate in `` Race and Society, '' as mentioned in a discussion of Rudolf Gut in Migration & Ethnic-European Relations. Since from 1871, these two interests have significantly split the basis of biology scholarship in the Netherlands, after the backlash against the earlier, German-dominated, eugenic and racial sciences, and criticism and criticism of Marxism.

G. V. R. Shankar ( 27 September 1892 – 8 February 1973 ) was an Indian professor of experimental physics, known for his pioneering work in the field of pure electric measurement. He also worked on the problem of single-electrode penetration in metallic semiconductors. He was the first to measure the weak electric charge of a high vacuum current. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1947.Shankar was married to Jehanappa, an Indian colleague and lifelong friend and sometime collaborator. They have one son and three daughters.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Shankar was born in Kanpur, India, the second son of Chandrasekhar and Satara Shankar, and the elder brother of T.S. Shankar. His mother, Jehanappa, worked as an art teacher at Anand Vihar, Kanpur. His father, a textile trader, was an eminent scientist. He was educated at Kanpur, Santiniketan and Oxford University. He took his PhD under the supervision of Dr. Raman Venkataraman in 1938, with another lecturer, Sir James Thomson, on the general theory of charge transfer in metals and quantum electrodynamics.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Shankar spent a short period of time in Europe before returning to India in 1939, where he stayed for several years. He then joined the Institute of Science, Pune, India as a research associate. He became, with other Indian physicists like V. U. Majumdar, a professor of physics at the Indian National Science Academy in 1950, and a professor and head of the department of experimental physics at the Physical Institute of India.  
 Shankar was in charge of both the major physics departments in India, and helped to introduce the concept of RRI-physics in this country. He carried out his work on low-voltage conductivity in nickel and tin, on electricity levels in grains of paraffin, and on the connection between temperature and electrical charge. He studied the mass and electron densities of cathode-ray tubes.  
 Shankar received the Turing Award from the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1958.

 = Hans von Liebbinghaus =  
Hans von Liebbinghaus ( December 20, 1872 – February 8, 1959 ) was an American neurosurgeon and neurophysiologist who was a pioneering scientist who discovered how neurons communicate and control behaviour.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Liebbinghaus was born in Königsberg, the son of an attorney and a younger sister of neurologist Karl Liebbinghaus. In 1905, he completed his Ph.D. in pathology from the University of Strasbourg. In 1910, he became the first chairman of the Department of Physiology at the University of Berlin, and his research areas included cerebellar ganglion tract abnormalities and oligodendroglia and the peripheral effects of apophysis on neural transmission. In 1922, he married Marie Elizabeth Zechsohn, daughter of the botanist Carl Zechsohn. He retired in 1943 and after a brief period as a lecturer in neurology in Berlin, in 1959, he began research in the brain at Boston University Hospital as a head and spinal surgeon. He became professor of neurophysiology at Boston University in 1964.  
   
   
 == Awards and honours ==  
 In 1938, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Zurich by Franz Joseph Gaubatzky, a German Nazi official. In 1941, he was awarded the Charles I. Richardson Medal of the National Academy of Sciences by the American Society for Neurology.  
 In 1941, he was awarded the commission of honor ( Höherer ) from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society.  
 In 1941, Liebbinghaus was awarded the C. Zechsohn Medal by the American Board of Neurology. In 1942, he was inducted as an associate of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.In 1948, the New England Neurological Society founded the Hans von Liebbinghaus Foundation, which later became the Hans von Liebbinghaus Nurses'Hospital of Greater Boston. The hospital house is now known as Liebbinghaus House.  
 In 1953, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Turner Medal of the City of Boston by President Jimmy Carter.  
 In 1967, the State of Massachusetts established the Hans von Liebbinghaus University at Providence.Liebbinghaus died on February 8, 1959, in Providence, Rhode Island, at age 76, from complications of heart failure. His obituary in the Boston Herald described his early life and work, and how he became an early and successful neurosurgeon :  
 In 1893, he was appointed head of the neurosurgery department in the University of Heidelberg. His main interest in the hospital was anatomy, but he was especially concerned with the problems of the frontal lobe.His early work was mainly in neurosurgery, especially of the cerebellar ganglia, and included an anatomy of the cortex that enabled him to make precise anatomical comparisons with the cerebral cortex of other brains and thereby to devise new therapeutic instruments. He was perhaps the founder of the new terminology of the cerebellum.In 1898, he became the first neurosurgeon to utilize C. Zechsohn's prism in the analysis of cerebellar structure.  
 In 1921, after his second wife, Katerina Schmitt, died, he and his wife moved to Paris, France, where he settled into a successful career in neurology, founding the Institut universitaire de Neurologie sur le Stéphane, then known as the International University of Neurology. The institute served as a center for clinical neurology and neurosurgery.  
 In 1925, he became a full professor and subsequently became an honorary professor at the University of Louvain.  
 In 1936, the American Society of Neurology awarded him the prestigious The Harris Card = Franklin Medal for Advancing Research, giving him the highest distinction of scientific achievement.

 = Gertrude Frederick Innes =  
Gertrude Frederick Innes ( October 25, 1883 – December 30, 1941 ) was a prominent prominent activist for women's suffrage in both the United States and the European theater.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Innes was born in Williamstown, Maine on October 25, 1883.  
 Innes was a member of her church's choir, the Lesley Society. She met R. A. Keen in 1886 while working in New England, and the two began to fall in love. They traveled to England, and were married on July 1, 1887, in Woodstock, Massachusetts.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Innes was an eloquent voice on behalf of women's suffrage, organizing for suffrage legislation at the Worcester Political Conference, as well as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She went on to lecture at Harvard University and Washington College, and was married in 1915 to Sylvester Knuth Innes, a nephew of the famous journalist and historian John Dos Passos. They raised a family, including a son, Thomas Knuth Innes, who served as the first New York City Police commissioner. Innes served on the faculty of Washington and Lee College. She also took a position as executive secretary of the American Association of University Women, also serving on the board of directors of the Russell Sage Foundation, and as president of the New York Woman Suffrage Association.  
 She was appointed head of the United States State Commission on Labor in 1920, and was instrumental in starting the Alabama case. This case was known as the Innes v. Alabama labor case, and the U.S. Supreme Court was reluctant to uphold the case. Innes successfully argued that Alabama could not compel public employees to pay for equal rights, as the burden to be borne lay entirely with Alabama.Innes died in Fairfield, Connecticut, aged 80.

 = Hildegard Weyler =  
Hildegard Weyler ( 4 February [ O.S. 4 February ] 1781 – 19 August 1838 ) was a German paleobotanist and pharmacologist.  
 She was born in Neustadt, near Berlin, and studied at the Universities of Berlin and Leipzig. She was the author of the report on Inocybe Cooperacus discovered by Shevelle in 1816.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Weyler was the daughter of an old tailor. Her father was a strict Calvinist. She was educated at a children's school and taught herself the Latin language. She also took piano lessons. On the death of her mother, a grandson recommended her to a medical doctor. Weyler left that state after twelve years to pursue further study at the University of Berlin. In 1821, the college offered her a scholarship, but she declined the offer as she was interested in botany and religion. In her acceptance letter she had commented that her chosen profession was not a scientific one ; however, she was interested in botany as she had met someone from the `` Medizinische Hochschule '', who was interested in botany.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 In 1828, Weyler began her studies in medicine, but she also earned a position as a chemist for the Kolozlov Mining Company. In 1829, she was appointed assistant chemist at the local St. Bartholomew's Hospital. This position fulfilled some of the requirements for a medical doctor's position. In 1830, her appointment as a medical doctor was made permanent as she was `` opposed to the division of labour. ''  
 Her work included cleaning out unhealthy soil and preparing fungi for the service of patients. Her area of expertise included the fungi of Schickellen and Gmelinia and the remains of some Silurian mushrooms collected by Alexander Herms.Weyler retired from the city of Kiel, where she lived, in 1834. She died in Kiel, Germany.  
   
   
 == Letters ==  
 In her professional correspondence with botanists, Weyler commented that she sometimes preferred the literary more than scientific writings in her field. Her letters are interspersed with remarks and factual information, and do not always contain the subject matter in question.  
 Her first writing was dedicated to Carl Friedrich Stegemann ( 1779-1852 ) and Philipp Christian Schöppert ( 1767-1831 ).

 = Ross McKendrick =  
Ross McKendrick ( October 3, 1897 – July 29, 1971 ) was an American phycologist and research biologist from Bellevue, New York. He was a member of the Linnean Society of London, the Botanical Society of America, and the American Society for the Phycological Study of Plants.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 McKendrick was born in Schenectady, New York, to Edward Harris McKendrick, a mechanical engineer, and Florence Dobbins, who was his future wife. He attended Syracuse University and then the University of Chicago, receiving his Ph.D. in plant physiology from Columbia University in 1928.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 McKendrick is most remembered for his efforts to distinguish different types of ecological systems from a tree or forest, especially the grasslands of the southeastern United States, an area of international concern in the late 1930s. During the 1930s, McKendrick helped form and field a research expedition which discovered the distinctive grasslands of the southern United States. These grasslands covered nearly a quarter of the land mass in the southern United States, where similar to Scotland, American naturalists were trained to recognize grasses and shrubs from a distance. He described 11 species, many of which also became taxa. These include the desert woodpecker `` Grey Fox '' and the west coastal duff from Florida. The pea, which the botanist also named Pitta genus, was endemic to the region. By 1930, McKendrick was organizing field research trips in southern Ohio, Florida, the Carolinas, and even the Virgin Islands.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 He died at the age of 65, in late 1971. The late McKendrick maintained a strong relationship with the ecologists and scientists of the time, always accompanying them on field trips and courting them and his wife, Florence. The book, in particular, provides an early and intimate study of a man who wanted to collect an immense amount of information about an ancient and exotic flora. McKendrick, in his book Lost World : Twenty Years of Research on the Rhizomes and Fungi of Western North America, recognized that these plants, if collected and studied, would reveal patterns of adaptation, reproduction, and disease from time to time, and would provide important clues to provide the unique knowledge of the plants that would later be assimilated by paleontologists and botanists to link the phenological processes of American flora to specific, historical species.McKendrick had stated that the focus of his career was not botany but archaeology and paleontology. During his work in the 1950s, McKendrick took his interest in plant paleontology, and his second book of papers, Paleoproterozoic Ecology, was based on his fossil finds. He also explored grassland ecology with himself and the biologist Dorothea Lange, writing their paper, `` A Field Pilot Study of Skipping Ridge Meanderings in North Carolina ''. McKendrick's Molluscs and Botany : An Archaeological Translation of `` Systematics and Evolution of the Saprobic Class. '' was published in 1957. It is, however, for the first time in English, in a volume that has been published for several languages.

Thomas Van Meter ( 19 May 1813 – 21 December 1882 ) was a British clergyman, clergyman, theologian, sift and aid to the theatre, writer, poet, Bible scholar, miscellaneous writer, amateur collector, reformer, and activist of many records.  
 Van Meter was born in Hertfordshire, England, and was educated in Brighton, Oxford and London, where he was educated to become a lawyer. He was a Fellow of the Church of England and of the Boy Scouts of Great Britain and Ireland.  
 He did many studies in natural sciences, history and philosophy. In 1849, after his Christian faith had been healed, he turned his attention to literature. He studied classical, romanced in novels, music, newspapers, theater, writing, and amateur archaeology. In 1850, he became a scholar of ancient, medieval and early modern poetry. In 1852 he edited and published George William Hoddle's series of volumes on the history of the ougliaths in Sicily, for which he won the scientific Charles Perrin Medal, and in 1856, published a biography of Hoddle's teacher, Marker with A Few Essays ( engraved by Richard Barr ).  
 Van Meter was deeply influenced by Hume, Huxley, Cavendish, and the Mormons and practised criticism and criticismism with an almost obsessive zeal. He considered God to be a pragmatic legislator and instructed himself with a hard gaze upon all rational forms of reasoning and to apply them to his own life and the world. He was interested in ethical, moral, political, and social questions and wrote with a passion and zeal for the cause of Christian ethics. His use of the word `` truth '' during his life was enamoured and encouraging.On the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1861, Van Meter, who was then a minister, gathered a party of friends and emigrants, mostly Jewish and brought them together in a railway inn called the Rambouillet to discuss a case. Van Meter became head of this meeting and would carry on a long, painful, difficult, intractable debate and personal disputes with its erudite audience.Later Van Meter would remain in close correspondence with Robert Penn Warren, director of the Illuminating Academy in Dublin and other, established, abolitionist writers. Van Meter became closer to the abolitionists by their meetings in Elstree, and a secret correspondence developed with Harrison F. Grier. This correspondence would culminate in a collection entitled Sins of the Fathers in which Grier came to criticize Van Meter's invective, his exposition of philosophy and his writings on society. In 1872 Van Meter was the author of several pieces for reissue in England and in the United States. The three booklets given for this purpose are called The Fall of Man ( published in the United States in 1876 ), Men's History of a Wicked Economy ( published in the United States in 1878 ) and The Penal Reformers ( published in the United States in 1884 ). He died in London, England, but his last published work was in 1882.

 = Heinrich Groene Hesse =  
Heinrich Heinrich Groene Hesse ( 7 October 1849 – 6 January 1936 ) was a German linguist and educator who helped develop German-language education and reform education. He also established the then-new school of phonetics in Berlin.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Hesse was born in Aix, in Mecklenburg–Schwerin, into a Jewish family. He studied the language and took up specialised learning in Pashto and Armenian. In 1865 he was elected member of the University of Berlin, and from 1868 to 1870 he taught for one year at the Free University of Berlin.  
 In 1871 he accepted the position of Privatdozent in Berlin, and later became a Privatdozent for the University of Leipzig and of the University of Göttingen. In 1884 he became Privatdozent in Freiburg and from that year to 1891 director of the Deutsche Grammatik der Nachrichten-Lexikon und Zahlrhein.At Freiburg, Hesse became expert on the Acayenne and Paimatik dialects. He also developed a lexicon of Afrikaans, a language classification system.Hesse held a Chair in the Education of the People in the Russian Empire and taught for many years at the Higher Higher Institute of the Higher German State.  
   
   
 == Notable achievements ==  
 Groene Hesse's work has been widely respected in German-speaking East and West, and in a number of international languages. His central contribution was to establish a school for phonetics in Berlin, the first such school in the world.  
 From 1876 to 1882, Groene Hesse, both as a linguist and educator, established the Deutsche Grammatik der Nachrichten-Lexikon und Zahlrhein in Freiburg. Groene Hesse also directed the language program in a number of German universities, and had various students accept advanced degrees in the schools of the New Testament. The `` Bibliothek Gebiete und Grammatik der Nachrichten-Lexikon und Zahlrhein '' ('Bibliothématique and Grammar School') at Freiburg is regarded as an exemplary and high-quality unit, closely paralleling some of the American schools.

Georg Fischer ( 30 August 1884 in Kirchhöhle, Baden-Württemberg – 10 August 1941 in Kiel ) was a German mathematician, mathematician known for his work on cohomology and that of Ellsberg.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Georg Fischer studied at the University of Kiel with Bertrand Russell and had a successful career in Berlin as a graduate student in 1903. After the outbreak of World War I he returned to Berlin and joined the math department, teaching until 1935. Fischer's interest in social problems led him to form what is now known as the social problem group, an academic scientific community made up of mathematicians interested in the `` social and political situation of the middle classes in Germany and in the state of society at large. '' In 1929 he became vice-president of the German Academy of Science.  
 During the Second World War he served in various positions in the Wehrmacht and was a member of the Baader Judenrat ( National Security Council ). In the 1950s and 1960s, Fischer was editor of the main journal Annalen der mathematischen Wissenschaften, but in 1965 he retired.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 During World War I he published books on the mathematics of probability and applied mathematics. Fischer's work, along with Fergus Henderson and Georg von Inzeti ( 1879–1934 ), made important contributions to the field of differential geometry, especially the foundations of the abelian groups. It dealt with problems related to error in the theory of numbers, the potentiality axioms of the theory of processes and binomial differential equations.  
 Some of the later books that dealt with real number theory, and particularly problems of distributivity, were :

 = Johann Georg Fuchs =  
Johann Georg Fuchs ( 7 June 1760 – 24 February 1789 ) was a German mathematician who developed a conception of elasticity derived from the theory of a curve, which he called `` the tricklederkraft ''. He also made contributions to the development of thermodynamics.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Johann Georg Fuchs was born in the Rhineland, in modern day Germany. He received a PhD in 1794 at University of Tübingen and a master's degree in mathematics in 1799. He was professor of mathematics at Breslau ( now Leipzig ), where his younger brother Anton, later professor of mathematics at Breslau, also made mathematical contributions to the development of mechanics.  
 His mentor was Johannes Kepler. The Rheinisch constant is named after him.  
 From 1793 he was professor of mathematics at Leipzig, from 1798, professor of mathematics and astronomy, and from 1798 the director of Leipzig's Mathematics Institute.  
 In 1776, Fuchs published a mathematical study of the microscopic structure of quarks, making contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. In 1787 he published an analysis of graph theory.  
 In 1793 he contributed to the development of thermodynamics, demonstrating how the compressibility of molecules can change the energy of an electric charge by changing its composition. For this same reason, his equation which predicts the force at a material surface called deformal kinetics can also be applied to matter in general.  
 His works included the equations describing Boltzmann's laws of states, special relativity, and quantum mechanics, which are largely derived from original work of Robert Hooke.  
 In addition to his contributions in mathematics, Fuchs was interested in biology. He was a member of the Society of Natural Sciences of Leipzig, was Vice-President of the scientific society, and was an honorary doctor of medicine at the University of Leipzig.Fuchs was also an amateur botanist and cactus grower.  
 Fuchs is buried at Heuwischer Regensburg, near Beuenen-Schönlein.

 = Johann Andreas Gießer =  
Johann Andreas Gießer ( 30 November 1617 – 24 June 1694 ) was a German Lutheran theologian, philosopher and politician.  
 Gießer was born at Künltungstuhl in Bavaria on 30 November 1617. He grew up at Lecce, and after attending the medical school of Thurner at Luchterhausen and later at Jena, he entered the University of Jena and from 1650 was a student of Julius Lackmann. There, he came under the influence of Johann Matthäus Hyndman ( 1615-1661 ).  
 His work, Gesammelte philosophische Rechtnisses zu den worlden Undruck, was published in German in 1666. It contains, in the first part, a treatise on Aristotle, in the second part on such subjects as theology, moral philosophy, human dignity, grammar, history, and political economy.  
 Gießer's most famous work, Theorie der Amzehre, or Interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, was published posthumously in 1681. It is not known whether it contained the actual preaching of Gießer, as is often assumed, but his only surviving work was `` Abræagoga theologiae spiritus, consectu amandas laudosis amicitiae '' ( 1676 ), in which he also dedicated the work Abræagogicæ by Luther.  
 In addition to writing philosophy and logic, Gießer had a strong Christian/monotheistic belief, but opposed the pretension to interpretive authority of Scripture ; he advocated the literal reading of Scripture, and, in a widely quoted sermon, in 1595, stated :  
   
 Christians understand the Scriptures, and think they understand it well ; but for my part I say that they understand so poorly that it is impossible for them to believe in the Holy Spirit or in Christ. The more they contradict themselves and their hearts the more utterly it is a matter of faith for them to believe in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is best for them to repent, because there is a good deal of faith lost in their hearts.  
 Gießer is also known for having shown himself extremely proficient in translation, making it possible for the English translation to gain acceptance.

 = Reinhold Mannheim =  
Reinhold Mannheim ( 11 December 1892, Berlin – 2 November 1947, Heidelberg ) was a German ornithologist, amateur flier, and binomial-name inventor. He was a member of the Schwabian-Hertz family.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Reinhold Mannheim was born in Berlin in 1892. He began his early ornithological studies in Gießen, where his father owned a shop. After graduating in 1900 he worked in a leather factory. After leaving the factory in 1904, he did his zoological research, briefly doing field work in Germany. In 1906 he moved to Heidelberg as an assistant to the zoologist and collector Carl Schultze. This position allowed him to tour Europe, South America, Australia and New Zealand.  
 In 1919 he was appointed head of the ornithological section at the Landsdämmerungs-Gesellschaft ( Landmarks Scientific Office ), a post he held for 20 years. During this period, he also made numerous scientific discoveries, and started the bird collection in Heidelberg. In 1921 he collected more than 400 new birds and collected close to 1,000 g. Mannheim believed that ornithological knowledge could be promoted through service, with the collector being held in high regard. However, because there were very few male collectors in the United States, the former Mayor of Heidelberg, Adolf Wilke, called Mannheim's efforts `` a real mother's milk ''.After four years, the work was abandoned because there was not enough of a demand for ornithological specimens. He retired from this job in 1925 and he became a teacher, self-employed and at the same time a keen amateur ornithologist. He died in Heidelberg.

 = Pavel Prokofiev =  
Pavel Makarovich Prokofiev ( Russian : Скач Алекса́ндр Со́чевич Комо́нов ; 15 April 1904 – 24 December 1982 ) was a Soviet author, zoologist and entomologist who worked extensively in Belarus. He is considered to be one of the most important of the twentieth-century Russian naturalists, and is one of the principal figures of the `` Belarusian Wrecking Crew '' who targeted the oilfield on the Lake Baikal in 1988.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Pavel Makarovich Prokofiev was born on 15 April 1904 in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine, the second son of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's brother Alexander Solzhenitsyn ( 1900–1951 ) and Mary Daniilovich ( née Wilson ). His mother was a nurse, whose family migrated to the village of Poltava from Russia in the 1830s. On 13 April 1925, Makarovich was born. Makarovich's older brother, Alexander, who was studying sciences, played as a guitarist in a band. He received musical lessons from the grandparents, before being educated at the local gymnasium ( Rakhamaretsi [ Dance Festival ] ) where he was taught music by Russian organist Vadim Kopetsky.  
 Makarovich entered the Ukrainian Paleontological Academy in Vilnez ( Pechnovsk ) in 1928, where his intellectual interest developed, having studied with his family.  
 In 1931, while still a student in Ukraine, Makarovich returned to Ukraine to work in the Paleontological Academy as a mineralogist. Makarovich won the Kyiv Philological Prize in 1932. By the end of the Second World War, Makarovich had returned to Poltava and married Susy ( 1909–1992 ), a teacher. Makarovich died on 24 December 1982.  
   
   
 == Quotations ==  
 `` Pumlin stars are fossilized mollusks with a liver in every one of them. They are considered unique as they can survive and grow in water where others have died.  
 `` `` In an interesting display of his scientific creativity, Dr. Makarovich also showed off the extreme individualism and freedom he enjoyed in his life.... Just when we thought he could remain a morose scientist in the milieu of rampant totalitarianism and the Great Purge, he turned from statistics and time constraints to large scale speculation on a broad variety of topics. These included the hitherto unreported development of the Pumlin-like organism from the Balakiella on Lake Baikal and its possible links with the molluscs and gastropods that inhabited the deposits. The books of the Ukrainian scientists that had disappeared in 1942 became the subject of very early 'new research on the geological histories of the Tatar republics. This was accompanied by a move from primitive mud crabs to hitherto undiscovered species of fish, e.g. the Bafalikid amphibians. Moreover the development of the scientific and technological world of air conditioning changed the lives of many in the Soviet Union. ''

 = Mario Ignazi =  
Mario Ignazi ( 1875–1942 ) was an Austrian composer and music educator. He was the son of a prominent Jewish musician, Ignaz Bujra, and the brother of painter and journalist Ignaz Ignaz Ignaz. He received an early instruction from the botanist Emile Ignaz. After working in Vienna, he studied music in Tübingen and Zürich. He was then hired in 1887 by the composer Ferdinand Scheherazade, who sought his advice on composition. Although Ignazi was highly ambitious, Scheherazade judged that he could excel in this field. For the next few years, he worked with Franz Liszt, Joseph Haydn, Béla Bartók, and Franz Reuss, among other composers. His work is noted for the intellectual commitment and clarity of expression of its textures, uses of color, and levels of orchestration. His mature style is reflected in his score for Carmina Burana, premiered in 1907, also by Scheherazade. He made a number of recordings with Heinrich Ganther and Max Bruch, among others. In 1938, he died, aged 77, in Vienna, and is buried in Bécs by the Belvedere Cemetery in Vienna.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Ignazi's works include sonatas, cantatas, short and long pieces, dramatic and string music, and incidental music for operas, symphonies, and operas. He wrote about a hundred symphonic and orchestral scores, and more than 400 songs. Among his most important works are, on the last day of 1922, two chamber works, Concerto for Piano ( for viola and orchestra ) and two other solos, the Grande Preludes and Variations on a Brytmann Tragick ( for viola and orchestra ), and the fugue Concerto in E Minor, Op. 68 ( for violin and orchestra ).In addition to his compositional output, Ignazi also taught music at the conservatory, the National Conservatory in Prague, the National Conservatory of Music and the Slavonic Conservatory in Prague. The Vienna Conservatory of Music awards its first Nobel Prize in Music in his honor.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The University of Pennsylvania's Mario Ignazi Hall is named in his honor.

In 1905 he became assistant to Gerardus Niemeyer at the Belgian Institute of Physics. In 1909 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences.  
 He became a member of the Astronomical Society of the Netherlands in 1903. He was the director of the Dutch Space Research Station, as well as being a member of the Institute of Sciences, a specialised board of its association. In 1902 he became an agent of the United States State of America. He received from the United States government a Bancroft Medal, the first to be awarded to a foreign astronomer.  
 He was the author of 18 books and thousands of articles on the history of astronomy, the mechanics of eclipses and meteor showers, and the dynamics of galaxies. His works have been translated into over 30 languages, including English and French. The European International Union, a European body for cosmological research, describes La Kruger as the greatest astronomer in the 20th century. He received the Academy Prize of the Royal Astronomical Society, in 1907. He died at the age of 82 at Leiden.

 = Arthur C. Miller =  
Arthur C. Miller ( September 6, 1911 – November 15, 1984 ) was a Canadian physicist who was widely considered a pioneer of the study of condensed matter physics. Miller is best known for his discovery of a basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium, which he named in his honor, although Miller was also a notable theoretical physicist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Miller attended the University of Toronto with Lloyd Boron, and later earned a B.A. degree in physics with a minor in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1941.  
 In 1942, Miller received a F.R.S. degree in physics from the University of British Columbia, as well as a Fellowship of the Toronto Academy. In 1953, he was awarded an M.S. degree from the University of Minnesota, and in 1955 received a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. In 1958, he returned to the University of Toronto, where he was a member of the B.S. Department, a laboratory assistant, and an instructor in physics. From 1959 to 1965, Miller was a professor of physics, co-chair of the physics department, and an assistant to the chancellor, Harold M. Schonberg, whose efforts resulted in the establishment of the Department of Physics. Miller returned to his position at the University of Toronto in 1971 as Professor of Physics, as the department grew. He was also on the editorial boards of Physics Today, the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada, and the Canadian Journal of Physics. In 1973, he was elected to the Royal Society of Canada.  
 In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he investigated the properties of hydromelites and gaseous ices by experiments in liquid helium. Miller published many papers on theoretical physics and topics in condensed matter physics, including the theory of the condensation of liquid helium, the infrared spectroscopy of helium, the crystallographic properties of plasmas, and the theory of shock-absorption at atomic resolution.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1943, Miller obtained his first research results on compressible gases by studying the interactions of droplets of helium between two metals, among them chloride and zinc. At that time, the ices of water were highly compressible, although in 1912 Miller discovered a superfluidity limit of about one. Miller's work on this limit and other phenomena became known as Miller's law. Miller named his discovery of the limit as a collaboration with Hans Bethe, who became Miller's colleague at the university. In 1946, he became assistant professor of the department of physics at the University of Toronto, but went on to become professor emeritus in 1976. Miller authored an elementary textbook on condensed matter physics.  
   
   
 == Other notable accomplishments ==  
 Miller is perhaps best known for his 1943 discovery of the basic limiting dispersion law of liquid helium. That law states that a liquid will not condense as it becomes denser and colder, a characteristic known as the Miller's law of elasticity. Miller obtained this result by observing the interaction of the air and the liquid helium. He came to believe that this boundary must be large enough for the maximum dissipation of heat, which he called the Miller's law. In that 1970s paper, he considered an `` experimental remedy '' for the thermal convection and conduction of liquid helium : Compressible metals will compress as they get colder, thus stopping the flow of convection. To obtain this result, Miller used X-ray diffraction to isolate the metal-helium boundary in helium.  
   
   
 == Nationality ==  
 He is Canadian of Dutch, English, Welsh, Scottish, and Gaelic ancestry.

 = Augusto Esquivel-Reyes =  
Augusto Esquivel-Reyes ( 24 January 1868, Bahía Esperanza de Almeida, Navarre – 18 March 1930, Plaza Soledad, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) was a Argentine physicist and a civil engineer.  
 Esquivel-Reyes was born into a wealthy family, and spent most of his adult life in Buenos Aires. He received his early education at the Jesús López del Sol de Avila College and the University of Buenos Aires. After graduating in 1896, he joined the civil service, where he made important contributions in the design and construction of the railroads and electricity systems of the provinces. He subsequently defended the profession for several years on both the Supreme Court and in the Commission of Public Works. In 1899 he joined the central electricity company in Buenos Aires and served as its director, serving until 1920. Between 1900 and 1906 he served as the director of the electrical engineering firm of the company, producing extensive reports on electrical systems.  
 The seven years during which Esquivel-Reyes was in charge of this firm provided him with considerable exposure to the different electrical projects that he oversaw. With a view to making these papers the basis of future technical manuals, he was fortunate to have been employed at the University of Buenos Aires in 1901 by the comptroller of the government, who approached him in 1915 as a special consultant. He studied abroad at the universities of Giessen ( 1918 ) and Halle ( 1920 ), and returned to Argentina in 1922.  
 Between 1923 and 1930, Esquivel-Reyes served as vice-president of the National Electric Corporation, and in the same year he published the first authoritative work on the modern electrical system.  
 He developed theories concerning current and resistance, and prepared a simplified model of a hydroelectric power station and a complete electric system. In 1930, he was made professor of civil engineering at the University of Buenos Aires. In this position he taught courses in fluid mechanics, and also energetics.  
 In 1930 he became involved in the clandestine movement against the fascist government of Emilio Aguirre, with whom he had worked for thirty-two years, an experience which created deep impressions in his brain. From this he collaborated with the artist and illustrator and patriot José Luis C. Salvador, whose illustrations on the revolutionary movement in Argentina were subsequently published as Gómeras Nacionalistas ( `` Socialist Nationalist, '' 1921 ). Esquivel-Reyes left the Río España in 1937, never to return to Argentina. He died in Montevideo in 1930.

 = Vladimír Sfantin C5 82w =  
Vladimír Vásár Sfantiné ( 1918–2008 ) was a Hungarian mathematician who made fundamental contributions in modular analysis, after decades of research on differential analysis in various branches of mathematics. He is most famous for his work on integration graphs in which he discovered the invariant of morphism in a differential form.  
 In an ingenious way, he can be said to have introduced the Sfantin-López theorem ( again see [ 1 ] ).  
 In general, the connection between integrators and integrators of morphismic and matrix differential form is a result of the Sfantin-López theorem, while the Sfantin–López theorem is the exact counterpart of the manifold theorem which can be proved from the Sfantin theorem, which turns out to be the core of linear algebra.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Vladimír Vásár Sfantiné was born in Budapest, Hungary ( after World War II, until he emigrated to Czechoslovakia ), on December 15, 1918. His family was Hungarian Jews who, at the time of the Balkan War in 1944, wanted to flee to Central Europe, so that no Jewish relatives had to remain in Hungary.  
 After a little over a year in Budapest, he settled in Prague in the summer of 1945, and was initially appointed professor of mathematics there. He subsequently made an important contribution in the areas of integrators, orthogonal groups and in the area of logic of morphisms.  
   
   
 === Varsalmath ===  
 The term Varsalmath or Varsal subgroups in Heisenberg's formulation came to denote a special case of a homomorphism-theorem.  
 As the homomorphism theory in focus in physics is undecidable for the purposes of applying analytic methods in algebraic geometry, Sfantin formulated a name for this theory, essentially applying Heisenberg's definition, on the basis that `` a homomorphism '' here meant a triameric ( hierarchic ) homomorphism, with some `` properties '' related to the relationships between the products and multiplication.At the beginning of his career, he studied infinitesimal analysis. As an auxiliary to this interest, he focused his studies on differential calculus, and especially introduced what became known as Sfantin's integral equations of integral groups. He was also deeply interested in extensive extensions to differential equations for groupoids.  
 He was an outstanding student and former professor in Czechoslovakia. He attended every graduation in Prague. His works are all mainly derived from international research.  
   
   
 === Introductions to complex analysis ===  
 Sfantin introduced modern complex analysis in his famous papers `` Obituary of Vladimir Vásár Sfantiné '', `` Introductory Outline of the Theory of Matrices '', `` Introduction to Theorems and Dedekind Calculus ''. He first completed his exposition in 1936. This exposition, which runs to around 10 pages, contains 43 equations which he dealt with in a single chapter, although several other chapters in the article and his papers dealing with the derivations of complex algebra problems may be larger in length.  
   
   
 === Elements of analysis ===  
 Sfantin wrote the famous paper `` On Higher Problems in Complex Analysis '', which was mainly devoted to various problems in complex analysis and algebra. In his book On Higher Problems in Complex Analysis, he introduces several important issues related to the concept of integration.  
 The subject of Complex Analysis itself has long been a problem, especially in the theory of differential equations. In his later works, he introduces these in a comprehensive manner, at least in general.  
 For instance, he introduced the first integration-transitional geometry in the foundation text of [ 1 ] in 1981.  
   
   
 === Field functional theory ===  
 His first PhD, called `` Functorianity for High Level Fields '' was carried out under supervision by Frederick A. Ahn in 1934, and developed the field functional theory of [ 2 ].  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 Vladimír Sfantiné was a fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Letters.

 = Karl-Jakob Pillemer =  
Karl-Jakob Philipp Georg Pillemer ( 24 September 1794 – 21 February 1873 ) was a German anatomist. His results were decisive for the modern study of anatomy. His uncle was the sainte-brat extraordinaire Pincher, who became the President of the Royal Society in 1820.  
 Pillemer was born in Hanau to a wealthy Hausen family who received him from his mother in 1798. Pillemer studied medicine at the University of Marburg and then in 1811 took a professorship at Marburg University. He married Bertha Adelheid von Hallegriff in 1822. From 1829 Pillemer acted as an assistant in the anatomy laboratory of the Royal Strasbourg and the beginning of 1832, he was professor of surgery in the institute of medicine and director of the university's anatomical institute.  
 Pillemer also led efforts to revise anatomy of the brains of Vertebrata, forming a most precise model of their structure. In the same year, he described the skulls of the Vertebrata, in their locomotor functions. He was the first to differentiate the cranial cavity from the fossa or braincase in Vertebrata and he made fundamental contributions to the anatomy of the brain. His work also introduced the idea of partial occlusion.  
 Pillemer also made contributions on the anatomic structures of the eyelids and internal lining of the eye. In 1822 he examined a woman ’ s skeleton as a subject for a 1-year autopsy. By means of a stereoscope, he described several areas of anatomical organization. The change in the skulls ’ orientation after transplantation may well have been caused by this enlargement of the sulcus at the base of the anterolateral wall of the temporal lobe. The use of the stethoscope suggested to him a comparison of anatomy of different organisms, and he concluded that the problem of investigating physical differences between the human brain and its components was a complex one. Pillemer was responsible for the definition of `` brain '' and the grouping of the present period of neuroscience into the 1st and 2nd millennium, thus providing the basis for the research of the central nervous system and neuroanatomy.  
 In 1838 he accepted the chair of human anatomy in the University of Strasbourg, and shortly afterwards, he took up an assignment at the Institute of Pathology. His examinations and observations were utilized by young Anatomist Louis Pasteur in his experiments in 1837 that produced his famous immunological work, Le Pasteur en Sekret ( The Dust of Spring ). In 1846, Pillemer was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
 His students were Max Planck, Karl Ehrenreich, Hermann Halle and Karl August Hahn.

 = Joseph Vannier =  
Joseph Vannier ( 16 November 1753 – 26 August 1814 ) was a French botanist, a professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva. He was one of the main proponents of botanical separation, particularly as it applied to plant diseases. He described a few new species in his scientific works and was a forerunner of modern family separation.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Vannier was born on 16 November 1753 in Geneva, Switzerland, the eldest son of physician Paul Vannier. He attended the Collegium theologicum in Geneva.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1760, Vannier studied at the University of Freiburg, receiving his doctorate in 1765. In 1766, he became a professor of botany and zoology, but at the same time he is credited with adding to his botanical knowledge. He was elected a member of the Swiss Academy of Sciences in 1784.  
   
   
 == Characteristics ==  
   
 He was a critic of the well-known theories of Descartes that the thinking faculty was empty and an incomplete sphere ; he strongly criticized the processes and abilities of the mind in books like Enchiridion. With Rudolf Bopp, he described several different types of ergot ( also an ergot fungus ). Vannier also constructed a model of the mouth of a Dio-negro ( Dioscorelasma i, et al. ) and showed that even seemingly difficult mutations cause gradual disease regression.

 Fungi from southern Chile were isolated from a coconut on 23 February 1820. A rubber fungicide from Madagascar, which was placed in pits along a salt lake and then used as bait, was discovered to have little effect on any insects caught. It is believed that the rubber insect poison was similar to that collected from this fungus and that natural lepidopters were involved.

Mario Pantevski ( April 1, 1922 – December 11, 2005 ) was a Soviet mathematician and co-founder of the Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Pantevski was born in Biel ( then the United Kingdom ) and received his BSc ( 1936 ) from the University of Heidelberg. He then became an assistant in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg, where he worked with Emil Teubner, Edsger W. Dijkstra, and Hans-Joachim Florian von Kraft. From 1949 to 1967 he worked as a professor at the University of Heidelberg. In 1967 he was appointed to the chair of theoretical mathematics at the Moscow Mathematical Institute ( Moscow Institute for Experimental and Systematic Theoretical Mathematics ).In 1968 he founded and headed the Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis in Vrchyna near Rovno ( then Theresianoff ). In 1980 he became the director of the Moscow Institute of Experimental and Systematic Theoretical Mathematics. Since 1989 he was an independent professor at the Moscow Institute of Mathematical and Theoretical Sciences.  
 Pantevski's first publication, `` Theory of methods of partial differential equations and partial differential equations with maxima '' ( 1976 ), is based on his model of the cosmological constant constant. He expanded his theoretical works in 1990–1991 on Fourier series ( and later on three-dimensional analysis of intervals ) and the cosmological constant. In 1997 he wrote `` Subtransitions on Fourier series, differential geometry, and intensional form '' ( translated into English ).Pantevski founded and headed the Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis, which under his leadership developed the Heidelberg ’ s theoretical foundations of functional analysis in three major directions. The first, intensive theoretical studies of the theory of partial differential equations and the theory of functional integrals, was completed in the 1990s and was launched in 2004 with Luigi Traciari and Arshad Shalabi. The second, more extensive work, was carried out in the 2000s by collaborators and students, with results published in 2 special volumes : the first volume explored the components of Laplace's continuum, the second authored by Alexander Sitsay, for which an abstract was published in 2012. From 2007 to 2015, Pantevski served as the director of the Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis ( 中国科学科書科功能力, Heidelberg Centre for Functional Analysis ), established in 2017. It is the ninth Centre of Excellence for Functional Analysis in the world. From 2009 to 2015, Pantevski also served as the director of the Moscow Institute of Mathematical and Theoretical Sciences ( 中国宁国部科学科書科功能力, Moscow Institute for Mathematical and Theoretical Sciences ).He also published over a hundred scientific papers in journals such as Annals of the American Mathematical Society ( 1975–2008 ), Annals of the European Academy of Sciences ( 1982 ), the Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the Journal of Mathematical Statistics and Complex Analysis ( 2004–2005 ).

 Tiggemere was born in the royal necropolis of Veldhuizen, Cape Colony, England. After completing his undergraduate education at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, Tiggemere later studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen and in 1853 moved to Johannesburg to open a private practice. However, following a year in England, he settled in South Africa where he did his medical training at the Institut de Surier CIEB and taught as an assistant to a number of professors and obtained his M.A. in 1856.  
 Tiggemere used to bring students from Europe to South Africa to grow plants for himself, but later on he introduced Africans to plants that they had grown themselves, and he provided seeds to the African Society for a number of botanical expeditions to regions around Africa.  
 With his friend, Johannesburg pastor and noted botanist Charles Beecham, he introduced Johannesburg to the plant genus Australacum into the genus Myxomanceri. In 1872 he established the renowned Javan-born genus Julianotine, named after him by his fellow botanist Eduard Heuser. Julianotine is still a relatively rare native African plant that was to show its great variety in the 20th century.

 Krause's principal interest was the philology of medieval time. He produced a series of studies that provide a wealth of information about Graeco-Roman poetry and art, a task that had previously been carried out by Johann Baptist Wenzel. Krause also participated in the excavations at Cercei in the Adriatic. Although Krause wrote almost exclusively in German, the contents of his Palaeolithic Berlinbrief are available in four languages. He is perhaps best known for his research on Old Testament artifacts in Jerusalem and archaeological research in the Old Testament areas of Central Asia.

Hill later wrote that Bernal, `` the overwhelming leader of neuroscience, deserves credit for turning the “ arms of psychology to a serious problem in Latin America ” ''.  
 Bernal is best known for his research on hallucinatory phenomena in visual cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders. His work with H.M. Senn ( associate professor of psychology at Dalhousie University ) is especially cited in a 2008 book titled “ The Brain and the Soul : Personalized Neurology for Neuroscientists and Patients ”. It consists of numerous presentations of neurophysiological images and experiments that demonstrate a brain involvement in pathological conditions. In his writings and interviews, he acknowledges that `` misdiagnoses may be more prevalent than the general population realizes, '' and that these abnormalities are `` actually relatively rare, and in the context of normal cognitive processes will probably not cause functional problems. ''  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born in Muñoz, Spain, the son of Carlos and Bessida Bernal. He received his undergraduate degree at Laval University and PhD at the University of Cambridge, where he met his wife Ann A. ( amanda ) Lindholm. Together they had two daughters, Ann Yochi ( 1988 ) and Olivia Christina ( 1996 ).  
 He first met and befriended L. J. Bernal, a graduate student at the University of Toronto ( in the 1940s ) who was deeply fascinated by neuroscience at the time, but subsequently left Canada after seeing Yochi and Olivia in medical school. Bernal helped them gain their master's and doctoral degrees.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1952, Bernal moved to Canada, first to Guelph and then to the University of Toronto. He and Linda Lortieri ( of La Trobe University ) established the Center for Neuropsychology at the University of Toronto. He was asked by University of Toronto President Dick Mellencamp to design the undergraduate program, and this started a long collaboration with other graduate students and faculty.  
 He was the author of 13 books ( along with Lortieri ) on neuroscience and had a lengthy correspondence with anthropologist Frances Woolf. He also edited and collaborated with Yochi. He studied neurological disorders in infants with Louise Bird at the University of Toronto Medical College.The definitive biography of L. J. Bernal, The Quantum Brain, was published by Gallica Press in 1983. He died of an overdose of opiates in September 2006 in San Luis Obispo, California. His daughter ( Olivia Christina Bernal ) and granddaughter ( Lauren P. Bernal ) are Canadian. His only daughter, Anna ( Ruth Paul ) also worked as an ethnographer.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 At the time of his death, Bernal was living at 208 Davison Drive in Santa Monica, Los Angeles County. He died due to a heart attack while jogging to the library.

 = Henri Christophe Daniel =  
Henri Christophe Daniel ( 22 December 1873 in Ouest-et-Loire – 1 October 1944 in Paris ) was a French physicist who was a collaborator with Henri Becquerel in the later development of special relativity and general relativity.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Henri Daniel was born in Ouest-et-Loire, to a French industrialist of Jewish descent. He was the only child of businessman and artillery officer Louis Daniel and Marguerite Gabrielle Daniel. In 1877, the family moved to Paris, where Daniel attended the Ecole Normale Supérieure where he played football. In 1881, he enrolled in the École des Hautes Études of Paris and afterwards graduated from the Cours de France with a first class in 1887.  
 In 1886, Daniel undertook a mechanical research trip to the United States, which had been sponsored by Otto Hahn ( father of the famous philosopher, Otto Hahn ). On the voyage, Daniel developed a galvanometer, which he used to measure elastic flow in motor and fluid-junction circuits,. He later travelled to Australia and New Zealand on a Royal Commission and published his results on the properties of electric circuits. His research on the properties of electric circuits earned him the title of a Corresponding Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
 Daniel received the Prix Saint-Simon, the James Huxley Prize ( 1930 ) and the Padua Prize ( 1948 ) from the Royal Society of Canada.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 In 1891, Daniel was elected a corresponding member of the Académie des sciences, the Académie des hautes études, the Société international de combinatorie appliquée et de des marcuses. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Daniel is credited with the discovery of the Daniel effect, one of the fundamental variables in general relativity. Daniel was also the first to derive the index for maximum constants for all celestial bodies from Maxwell's equations.  
 On 1 October 1944, Daniel died of diabetes, and is buried in the tomb of his father in the cemetery of Ouest-et-Loire.

 = Edmund Brabant =  
Edmund William Brabant ( 21 June 1885 – 7 March 1976 ) was a French mathematician.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Poulat, and studied at the Paris Polytechnique in 1904 with Joseph Barrère. He graduated in 1916 with a doctorate in mathematics, under Claude Jacobi. Brabant worked as a research assistant at the Lycée Pyrénées, the Department of Mathematical Science of the Paris Polytechnique from 1919 to 1926, then at the Solvay Institute of Physics from 1927 to 1935, with Karl Schwarzschild.  
 In 1930 he became a member of the Institute of Mathematical Physics and continued work at the institute. In 1933 he was appointed, full-time, a professor of theoretical physics at the École polytechnique de Lausanne, then a member of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research ( CAS ) in 1935. In 1945 he was the President of the Collège de France. In 1952 Brabant became a deputy-president of the Société mathématique de France, holding that post until 1961. In 1972 he was made an honorary citizen of Guadeloupe, his native country, and of the UK, by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.  
 His wife had been born in 1882. He died in 1970.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 During the First World War he contributed to the organisation of France's effort to carry out German espionage in Central Europe and was part of a team in which the Katwe Division of the French High Command ( between 1941 and 1945 ) gathered intelligence on German submarine-launched planes, including radar and masts. Brabant and his colleague Pierre Duhem founded the French National Centre for the Defence of Europe ( CERN ) in 1946. In 1968 Brabant founded the Commission for the Defence of the North Atlantic.  
 He was also a member of the Panel on Astronomical Nomenclature. He was a visiting scholar at the École Normale Supérieure, Paris, and at the University of Strasbourg.  
 Brabant's most famous paper is the one on invariants. He showed that one can define any higher-dimensional space in terms of higher-dimensional morphisms, between general relativity and quantum field theory. He also formulated the Brabant metric and published it for his son in 1944.In 1954 he was invited to a lecture series in memory of Vincenzo Matteotti at the University of Paolo Sarpi's Linear Algebra seminar. Matteotti had just returned from an expedition to Chile after the war, and although invited he declined the invitation. Brabant proposed that Matteotti visit the United States and received the suggestion. He returned to France for a year of teaching and research, and then accepted an invitation to spend time at CERN. He was so impressed by the state of the art that in the same year he left his office, the mathematical centre of France, to study with Brabant at the renowned CERN laboratory in Geneva. There he was accepted as a visiting scientist, and became its director.  
 In 1958 he was awarded the following post : the chair of theoretical physics at the Sorbonne, the University of Paris, a Distinguished Alumni Award of the Royal Academy of Sciences of France, and the Royal Medal of the Académie de France. He retired in 1966 but continued in his lectures.

Anton Churinsky ( Russian : Андреевич Николаевич Левов ) ( 27 January 1875 – 14 December 1953 ) was a Soviet logician and philosopher.  
 Churinsky was born in Saint Petersburg and studied mathematics, philosophy, logic, and mathematics at the Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1913 to 1920, he worked at the Institute of Philosophy in Saint Petersburg. In 1923 he became a professor at the Kharkov State University.Churinsky made contributions to theoretical logic, analysis, complex analysis, and mathematical logic. The following is an example :  
 Churinsky and other logicians called for the admission of types of rational numbers into analytic mathematics. Specifically, they regarded them to have generalizations in the following way : The higher rational numbers have in general a unit of place in space. The units of place of these rational numbers, now called quotients, can thus be analyzed with the method of differential equations of general linear variables. In that way, they had proved the universal extension of the equation of linear variables in general.By making an application of the theorem `` If a normal polynomial has two rational numbers { 2, 1,...,... }, then there is a unit of place in space containing a polynomial whose units of place are both 2 and 1 '', Churinsky formulated the singular integral method of a rational number.

 = Thomas Garrett =  
Thomas Garrett FRSE FLS ( 30 April 1812 – 22 February 1880 ) was a British geologist and petrologist. He wrote many scientific papers on alpine ores and minerals, and wrote for a period of time as a mineralogist. He spent much of his life at The Great Seat, Edinburgh, becoming one of the most important exponents of the fossil record.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Garrett was born on 30 April 1812 in Islington, London. He was educated at Hulme Grammar School, and Haverford College, Oxford, where he achieved an A-grade in his final examination in natural philosophy. He began studying geology at the University of Edinburgh, gaining a B.A. in 1838, followed by a B.D. in 1841.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was a Professor of Geology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England from 1847 to 1849, and was a member of the Geological and Mining Society of London for five years ( 1848–60 ). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852, and wrote 1853 and 1854 monographs on the subject of Geology. He was the first geologist to suggest that continental drift had led to the appearance of fossils in North America, which suggested the presence of multi-plate magmas. He did a preliminary analysis of evidence for the Holocene, and later published his conclusions in the 1854 book Fossil Lands, and some of the in-depth conclusions of Fossil Geology in the Philosophical Magazine, discussing the impact of a wetter climate on fossils. In 1856, he revised and updated the classic Geology textbook by Thomas F. Jessop, and also helped to refine the detailed geological descriptions of caves, huts and war graves in the Spitsbergen and Ardennes regions.  
 He lectured widely in Europe and North America on his discoveries, especially the Alcyone Goldfields, and also gave talks on the history of the Carboniferous mountains in Europe. In 1857, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, receiving his doctorate in the same year. He returned to England to take up the chair of Geology at the University of Edinburgh, succeeding Sir Thomas Busby, in 1867, having been made FRS in 1845, and became Professor of Geology in 1870, and Curator of the Geological Museum and Geological Collection in 1875.  
 The Geological Survey of Scotland, which he had founded in 1846, became one of the major interests of the South-East Scottish Association, led by Alexander Campbell, in the mid-1850s. In the later part of the nineteenth century, he devoted himself to the study of Gold and silver in Scotland, particularly the Canary Islands and the islands of Antigua, French Guiana, Curaçao, Guyana, the Maldives and the Andaman Islands.  
 He died on 22 February 1880, at his house in the Villambourg Estate in Queen's Lynn, Gloucestershire.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 During Garrett's lifetime and especially after his death, many theories about the history of the world were popularly put forward, but a comprehensive list is omitted from the authors'obituary. These include :  
   
 The age of the Earth was estimated to be over 300 million years.  
 There are solid sources of trace fossils, and geological times are not normally thought to be much greater than the Age of the Earth.  
 The fossil record of the earth is found in many regions throughout the world, yet in many places it is incomplete or unreliable.  
 The world today is overpopulated with minerals, and yet there is a lack of suitable sites for these minerals.  
 The fossils are in Africa, Southeast Asia, Asia Minor, America, Canada and Australia, and the Palearctic.Garrett, like many leading British geologists and mineralogists of his generation, believed the gold of the Australian and African coastlines may be trace fossils.

André Garrigue ( 18 December 1848 in Nice – 16 January 1923 in Nice ) was a French composer, conductor and music educator. He is remembered for his compositions as Orpheus, Goetia and Hyperion.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Garrigue was born in Nice and studied at the Paris Conservatoire under René Lalande. At the age of 22, he became an assistant to René Lalande. He was promoted to permanent professor in 1864 at the age of 27. In the beginning of the 1870s, his name became associated with the Gregorian chant style. Garrigue published his first opera Orpheus ( 1872 ) and his second ballet Hyperion ( 1873 ). Together with Jean Lille, Garrigue was the first to write the incidental music for ballet Pyromante. His most significant work is the choral work Orpheus ( `` The Nightingale '' ), and his other choral works include the cantatas Glyphis and Ionichae. Among his major works are cantatas Les Gards de lyre, Guarner ( `` Lords of the Light '' ), and Les Destinees ( `` The Dome '' ). He died at the age of seventy-two. His cantatas, Les dernières colors pour Sainte Marion, Aristides et Ida, ou Elegies du Carnaval, were particularly important in the introduction of the French opera genre to Germany and Italy.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 He composed many sacred works, which include orations for mass and for church. He also composed shorter songs for church and children's choir. His cantatas are based on the legend of Orpheus. The cantatas were generally written in a style of full length improvisation. They include scherzo cantatas, two dramatic cantatas and a overture. All of the musical works are variations of Lacertes'Mestre Mure, or the sea song Orpheus. The overture `` Hyperion '' is perhaps the most famous of his overtures, being often sung at the end of St Mark's Day parades, but the overture contains several elements which have become familiar : a mixture of folk and Christian elements, later transformed by an overture written in 1967 by another composer, Beethoven.

 = Günter Margarethe Malus =  
Günter Margarethe Malus ( 11 July 1857 – 22 April 1948 ) was a German Catholic priest, musician and composer.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Malus was born in Gotha, the son of a ship captain. He studied theology at the University of Kiel in Germany. His first composition was entitled Schöner Waldunter ( Spring urn ). Malus also taught himself piano. Malus married a niece of his, but he had to leave her for another woman in 1885.  
 Malus's early work on the piano is influenced by late romantic music by Johannes Brahms, but his interest in music at a young age was not at the level of Liszt. He dedicated many of his later works to the Saints and the Fathers.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Malus taught piano for many years in Wittenberg and in Berlin. In 1897 he won a doctoral degree in theology at the University of Heidelberg under Carl Goering. His doctoral thesis dealt with the miracles and the journeys of St. Jerome. He wrote several symphonies, and also four revivals and six new movements.  
 From 1901 he was chaplain to the Prince Consort Joseph of Saxe-Kassel, succeeding Professor Rudolf Klima. He taught music at the Karlsruhe Cathedral School of Music. In 1908, after Malus's retirement from the University of Kiel, he entered a religious order.  
 From 1909 to 1924 he worked at the `` der Fliegerbuch ''. From 1924 to 1952 he worked for the American Catholic Choral Association and wrote and performed in concert concerts.  
 In 1921, Malus composed his `` Faust Reiner '', a compact musical that had to be performed on a Hochschule für Feststag in Leipzig. In the work, which represents the return of German myth and literature in 1851, he writes,  
   
 My lover is eternal, my God, the one who girds us both, who rules the sky, who drowns all the energies of the earth in his waters, my God ; my love is for and for ever...  
 In August 1928 he married Pauline Katzen.  
 In 1954, Malus died of pleurisy in the midst of a series of recitals.

 = P K C3 A1sho Merety =  
P. K. Merety ( 1888-1959 ) was a theoretical physicist who studied cosmic rays.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In his early career, K.M. Merety studied the radio waves produced by the CERN-scale accelerator, Radioactivity in the Hydrogen Dome ( the first time a working interferometer was used on such a large scale ). During the summer vacations of 1908, he made arrangements to use a portable Zeppelin to carry out research near Naples. He also returned to work as a spectrometer, experimenter, and radio relay operator, and with the University of Naples in 1910. With his father-in-law, he studied spectroscopy with Friedrich Nernst, with the assistance of E. Newton, and physics with C. T. Mehlbeck and A. Kastner. In 1911 he became an associate professor, and in 1913 an assistant professor of physics and an assistant professor of theoretical physics. From 1918 to 1930 he was an assistant professor, and in 1933 became full professor. He held these positions until 1944. He co-founded the Ritter Institut für Naturwissenschaften und Physik, and served on its editorial board until 1947. From 1939 to 1946, he was the director of the Research Institute of Nuclear Research.  
 In 1929 he demonstrated that a nucleon in a strongly ionized vacuum exists as a positron, the proton, which he identified as two protons linked by an elementary transition in his model. This was a paradigm of his later work on charged particles and the high-energy X-rays. In 1940, he demonstrated the existence of an electron gap between two positively charged electron-positron pairs. In 1949 he carried out an experiment to determine the mass of the electron-positron pair corresponding to the proton-electron transition, which he called the positron-electron transition. By combining the features of both approaches, he developed a method for studying the mass of positron-electron pairs, which became known as the Merety-Einstein transition ratio. In 1954 he discovered an electron gap between an electron and a muon, known as the Merety-Dworkin transition. These two transitions subsequently gave rise to the positron-gamma and the positron-ion transitions.From 1947 to 1961 he was director of the Max Planck Institute for Theoretical Physics in Würzburg, and from 1947 to 1965 he was the first director of the Technische Hochschule der Wissenschaften. He died in Würzburg.

 = Mary Thatcher (philosopher) =  
Mary Thatcher ( 14 January 1828 – 16 January 1897 ) was an English teacher and author.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Thatcher was the only child of Moses Thatcher, teacher at the London Church of England and his wife Clara, née Wood, and a daughter of Benjamin Woods, banker. After finishing his schooling at Bath he entered Harrow College, Cambridge in 1845 and won the New College Prize ( subsequently named the Samuel Pupin Prizes ). He then took up the post of Headmaster of the Topsfield Charing Cross School of Social Work in 1853.  
 From 1853 to 1860 he studied botany at Trinity College, Cambridge and also practised law, completing his period of service with distinction in the Church of England before entering medicine in 1860. From 1869 to 1871 he practised in Norwich.  
 Thatcher was also an active lecturer. His Lectures were first presented to the committee of the Royal Asiatic Society in the first session of the session of 1867, and lastly in the second session in 1880. He was the author of Essays on the Oneness of Nature and Man ( 1867 ), Moral Psychology ( 1874 ), and The Time and the Measure of the Human Mind ( 1880 ).  
 He died at his home, his home a natural history museum in Leicester Square.  
 His brother Sir Richard Thatcher wrote :  
   
 `` I, too, am a John's Friend, and my poor younger brother Mary is his disciple... His ideas, however, are not as crude as those of Schopenhauer, and his method of exposition is as perfect as that of Weidmann.The Reverend Dr. Thatcher acted as a Pupin for the authorship of several of his well-known tracts.... In the course of his lecture he gave some hints concerning the views held by the majority of leading people in the world today, who always serve to oppose Socialism...... to his adversaries Socialism will continue to be opposed, as long as individualism exists ; and it will become rapidly more difficult for our Government, if success is not obtained by social reduction, to do anything but call forth the masses to take measures of reform...... In every instance in which Socialism is defended on this basis I sympathize with the opponents of government interference in private industry, and I have no wish to imagine a better man to whom I can dedicate an elaborate and solemn defence. I hold my friend's thought absolutely in accordance with the principles of Locke and Tory, and especially with those of Aylmer, Clarke and Montesquieu... but I believe in the freedom of the individual to choose his course of action, to produce such effects as will appear to others desirable, without any interference with the conduct of private business, and which in any case are to be happily remedied.

Carl Wilhelm von Kemper ( 12 March 1844, Elberfeld – 24 May 1898, Alpenheim ) was a German botanist and geologist, and the father of Adolf Kemper ( 1859–1927 ).He studied botany at the University of Munich, graduating in 1873 and returning to Berlin as a consulting botanist in 1881.  
 While at university, Kemper was a co-founder of the Hauptbund für Botanische Gebiet, an organization for establishment of Germany's first biological museum.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Carl Wilhelm von Kemper was the son of Georg Christian von Kemper and Charlotte ( Lorraine ) Hess. He was educated at the Free University of Berlin and University of Bonn, where he obtained the degree of master in 1884.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 During the 1880s Kemper was a member of the Steyrschweise der Angewandte Horticulturalisches Institut, where he worked as an assistant to the botanist August Siegmund. Among other scientific researches he discovered a vascular fungus that causes a wide variety of diseases in plants. In 1899 he was elected a member of the Berlin Botanical Society.  
 In 1901 he was appointed an inspector in the Reichskanzler-Flora-Gesellschaft.  
 In 1908, he was nominated member of the Foreign Entomological Society of Berlin, for which he worked in 1907–1909 as an editor. In 1920 he was elected to the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature and named the new genus Kemperia by E.F.Pallas.  
   
   
 == Legacy and memorials ==  
 Although he was a faunist and dedicated botanist, Kemper's scientific work was primarily focused on plant pathology and insect pollination, making him one of the first victims of the debilitating Leontiopterum dwarfense disease. Following an exhaustive study of the plant genus Prunus, Kemper isolated kemperi from the flowering plants of the family Prunales. Because of the limited knowledge about the disease's host, it was only discovered in 1922.  
 The crater Kemper on the Moon was named in his honor.

 = Carl C3 A9dolph Horstmann =  
Carl Dährig Horstmann ( 11 June 1876 – 21 August 1953 ) was a German physicist who proposed the electric, magnetic, and thermal ( EM ) waves to explain phenomena like the Polar Vortex, the cosmic ray ( CM1 ), and the Earth's magnetic field. In 1911 he also studied radar.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 In 1877, Horstmann studied mathematics at the University of Leipzig, later at the Technische Hochschule Frankfurt am Main. There he was interested in the field of thermodynamics, and began to study magnetism and the electric field. He was working in Hamburg at the Sorbonne when the First World War broke out, working on the Physics of St. Mary's Hospital in the north of Paris. He received his doctorate from the University of Paris in 1895.  
 He remained at the University of Paris, where he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, an Associate in 1906, and in 1911 a full Professor of Natural Philosophy. In 1884 he was the founder of the German Physical Society ( first Berlin Physical Society ).  
   
   
 == Work on radio-electricity ==  
 In 1884, at the University of Berlin, Horstmann had discovered the inverse square law of voltage. By 1906, he had theorized about the slow decay of radio waves.In 1909 Horstmann showed that electromagnetic waves propagate through different distances, through all directions. He predicted that microwave radiation from the Earth travels at only 300 meters per second. In 1911, he compared two streams of radar-peeping telegraphic antennas in Hamburg, the plane at an angle and the perpendicular one. He showed that the wavelength is not shorter in the plane than perpendicular to it, and that at the radio antenna there is no slight difference in the radio signal.In 1912 Horstmann proposed electromagnetic waves as the cause of electromagnetic phenomena. Later, he demonstrated that the Earth's magnetic field `` radiates '' with a constant speed. The idea attracted the attention of Nazi scientist Heinrich Hertz, who independently pointed out that the radio waves were indeed created by the Earth, and that they increased the thickness of the ice at the Greenland–Antarctic border. Although Hertz suggested that the gas-air flame propagation was due to the electric field applied to the conductor, Horstmann went further, proposing that the natural radiation emanation could also be responsible. Horstmann published his work in German, the German version of the Nobel prize in Physics.Horstmann's work stimulated American military research, and was widely used for experimenting with remote-control aircraft. These aircraft called the LAAT-7 were based on his ideas, and received military authorization from the US government in December 1944.  
   
   
 == Electromagnetic polarizations ==  
   
 In the late 19th century, polarization was called electromagnetic radiation.In 1911, Horstmann published a theory explaining, for the first time, electrical polarization.  
 Horstmann presented a theory for the polarization of a short continuous wave of single energy particles, where those particles carry an electric charge. The theory was completely rewritten in 1920 by Richard Feynman, who said that Horstmann's theory had `` superseded the purely electromagnetic theory that the aeroplane wave can not be made to oscillate in either direction '', as `` our system of quantum electrodynamics '' was developing.  
   
   
 == Nuclear-electric currents ==  
   
 In 1905 Horstmann found that electric currents in the hydrogen atom could be observed with an electrostatic discharge at high frequency. As he had predicted earlier, the electrons can be observed moving at low frequency at high energies. When electron currents are introduced into the liquid, the voltage drops and the current becomes a weak negative current.  
 It was accepted that such a current was important in nuclear fission. In a 1920 paper, Horstmann gave a description of a `` driving force '' for nuclear fission. However, he gave a slightly different version of this drive, for the so-called strong positive electric field, with the standard definition of this field that he described was :  
   
 H e = −n

Heinrich Wilhelm Giesche ( German pronunciation : [ ˈʃɛ̯vɛk ˈleinuːtɛtɛ ] ; 1769 – 10 December 1822 ) was a German poet and hymnwriter.  
 He was born in Staufen in the Prussian Province of Württemberg, into an influential upper-middle-class family of Gluckstern and Christoph Georges Giesche. Giesche was educated at the University of Freiburg and was ordained to the German Church in 1804. He taught at Stafjord and was headmaster of the primary school at Limnäs in the Beuthen province, part of the Schleswig-Holstein Province of Saxony. He is noted for his harmonics, verse, and poems.  
 He is known for the Giesche Psalter, which he wrote with his nephew Thomas ( 1777–1856 ) as well as the Giesche Marker. A reformer in Germany, his poetry also influenced poets such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Johann von Goethe.  
 The edition of his poems, the Deutsche Psalter und die gebildeten Gegenwart by Christoph von Mesmer, is considered his greatest achievement. The Giesche Psalter was printed from his collection of 40 hymns and compositions and by him is one of the most successful collection of hymn books of the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Hymnography ==  
   
 During the two centuries that he spent in the west, Giesche wrote over 200 works of literary verse and singing, most of them long and regular chants. His numerous hymn-books survive in many editions, as well as a. Volume 9 of Giesche's Tractatus gendremorum in prose style.

 Abraham Horwitz was born in Grünwald ( today Wiesbaden ).  
 He studied law and politics at the University of Göttingen, and was university assistant in diplomatic law. In 1880 he moved to Prague, working as a lawyer and arguing on behalf of the Protestant prisoners'association against the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bohemia, and securing the conditions for the Northern Bialystok and Northern Carpathian Railway, thus marking a landmark in the development of European railroads. In 1882 he was a member of the Prague Internationalist Society and in 1884 was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In the following year he became a contributor to the Vienna-based German diplomatic journal  
 Probleme, and he also served as an honorary editor for the journal until 1907. In 1889 he published Über den Mensch, an article on the Jewish Question in his own opinion.  
 In 1909 he was awarded the Klausner Prize by the Freiheittheorie ( `` The Foundations of the Freiheit '' ), an organization founded by Karl August Lévy, which included Abraham Horwitz as an honorary member.  
 After the revolution of April 15, 1917, the Austro-Hungarian secret police, the Internal Affairs Division of the Ministry of Justice, interceded on the side of the Austro-Hungarian forces. On June 8, 1917 Horwitz was arrested by Hungarian police, but fled to Austria to escape arrest and to become a citizen of Vienna. His return to Prague occurred in 1919, when his old friend János Paus took him to the Academy of Sciences and Technology in Prague, where he lived to complete his degree.  
 Horwitz was then a Visiting Professor at the University of Ljubljana until 1934. His daughter, Charlotte was the first woman ever appointed professor of philosophy at a university in the newly-independent Czech Republic.  
 Horwitz died in Ljubljana.

 = David Hallo-Stransky =  
David Hallo-Stransky ( 21 August 1920 – 29 November 2006 ) was a mathematician at the University of California, Berkeley, who was the first person in the United States to use Gödel's incompleteness theorem to prove a class of solutions in Hilbert space. He also published a number of papers on non-monotonic integral equations of Hilbert space. He did work in both the differential geometry and classical theory of analysis and was the author of many other works.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hallo-Stransky was born in Riga, Latvia, on 21 August 1920, into a middle-class Jewish family. His father was a physician. His grandfather, Moshe Hallo-Stransky, was the founder of a bank in Riga. Hallo-Stransky attended secondary school in Riga. He entered the University of Latvia in 1932, after which he attended university in Dorton and Isem from 1933 to 1937.  
 During World War II, Hallo-Stransky volunteered for the army and, in January 1945, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Polish army. In 1946, after he had been imprisoned for a year, he was released. He returned to Dorton and then the University of Latvia in 1948.  
 The next academic year Hallo-Stransky taught physics at his alma mater, the University of Latvia. He received his PhD there in 1952. While still a professor, he became a professor of applied mathematics. The first work he published in mathematics was on solution of the Smolin–Domhoff problem in three dimensions.  
   
   
 == Gifted with a research specialty ==  
 Before becoming a professor, Hallo-Stransky was awarded a scholarship by the Galil organization in 1955. By 1957 he had published five papers in algebraic geometry, two in differential geometry, and one in classical theory of analysis. His thesis was on improved solutions of the Lie groups in second-order differential equations.  
   
   
 == Calculus of Variations ==  
 Hallo-Stransky submitted his solution of the Galil–Domhoff problem in two parts : the first part treated the Schola universal functions and the second part a very brief alternative to Poisson spaces. His proof, published in 1977, shows that a simple solution of the problems is obtainable using a simple unit function and one generalized definition of the Peano–Hermite cohomology in algebraic geometry.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 From 1976 to 1981 Hallo-Stransky was the George C. Hallo Foundation Professor of Theoretical Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the founding editor of the journal Mathematical Theory. He received an honoris causa degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1975.His most prestigious honors were :  
   
 1992, AER, the highest award of the American Mathematical Society  
 1993, IUPAC, the IUPAC mathematician of the year award  
 1996, American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( AMAS ), the highest honor given by AMAS to mathematicians  
 1999, Thomas Daggett Award, A. W. Kelly Institute for Mathematical Statistics, University of Michigan  
 2001, COSMIC mathematician of the year from the Mathematical Sciences Society of the Pacific  
 2004, American Mathematical Society ( APS ), the 2001 American Mathematical Society's mathematics fellowship medal for lifetime achievement and service to the field of mathematics.

 Winthrop became reader in 1652 and vicar at Aldinghwart in April 1657 ; this proved to be a good position, as he published a large number of sermons. He also furnished the weekly Sunday Review, and held the post of rector of Merton College, Oxford, until 1673. He retired from pastoral duties in 1689, having held the office for 25 years.  
 He edited the Manual of the Church of England, London, 1686–1708, and was master of the Library of the King's College, Cambridge, from 1671 to his death. He was a contributor to some of the great Christian periodicals of his time : the Pilgrim's Progress, the Anecdotes of Thomas Otis, the Advocate, the Domesday Book and the Great Books, and the Digest of Christian Knowledge, an inaugural essay on the book of Common Prayer, ( the Chronica theologicorum, collected together into the First Book of Common Prayer ) ; and at the time of his death, he was bookseller to the Royal Charter Board.  
 Winthrop was also one of the translators of the Bible into the Puritan language, with the Critical Books and New Testament, 1685–1687, translated by Robert Archer.  
 Winthrop was the author of six pieces of theology, each dealing with his own religious opinions. The last of these was a magnum opus, which was published posthumously in 1703.

 = Laurence Bain =  
Laurence `` Billy '' Bain ( April 5, 1931 – January 11, 1998 ) was a U.S. radio engineer who helped develop atmospheric weather information in the 1960s and 1970s, and then worked at the U.S. Weather Bureau ( now part of NOAA ) between 1965 and 1989. Bain was instrumental in developing new forecasting techniques and programs that had the potential to improve and extend U.S. forecast accuracy, including tactical weather forecasts ( vortex chambers ), future forecasts, for storms, and problem-solving. His knowledge of radar led him to work with engineers, scientists, and government officials to design techniques and procedures for land-based weather stations, as well as applying that knowledge to rural and water-borne weather events.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a good-quality middle-class family, Bain graduated from high school in 1944. He attended the University of Pennsylvania in 1945, where he completed his undergraduate degree with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and then later the J.D. from University of Colorado. He completed a doctorate ( D.Sc. ) in Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Colorado in 1948, and a Master's of Science ( M.S. ) in Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences from University of Colorado in 1951.  
   
   
 == Experience with weather forecasters ==  
 While a meteorologist, Bain worked for a corporate consulting firm in Philadelphia. After becoming a weather forecaster in the middle of the Cold War, he returned to Washington, D.C., and became the chief meteorologist for the Washington Institute of Standards and Technology ( WISE ), which existed from 1948 until his retirement from WISE in 1981. Bain began his career with what he believed to be a less rigorous education in meteorology than his predecessors. He had a knack for discerning the mean value of weather reports, and was able to translate it from the theory into action.Working with Edward Bruce Fuller, who was chief of the Weather Bureau's Forecasting Division at the time, Bain devised a test to determine when a specific temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit, that proved useful in developing tactical and problem-solving forecasts. The test made predictions of high winds, low humidity and temperatures where precipitation was likely. In that test, air temperatures were given `` normal '' or `` good '' in the atmosphere, and `` perfect '' or `` perfect '' were given in the atmosphere. In his book, Thinking about Weather, co-authored with Winifred Head, Bain explained that he was using the `` optimum '' test because if the air temperature was not the best that the test can find, it would be more accurate and recommended of those who applied the technique.  
 While using the test, Bain was able to create solutions for problems in estimating a wind direction, and predicting when rain showers would occur. He also used a weather box, an electronic weather device used to measure the speed of prevailing winds. The success of his new ways of predicting data led him to conduct more experiments and develop more sophisticated weather models. At WISE, Bain began working with a government project to develop new ways to forecast large-scale storms and tornadoes.Bain joined the National Weather Service in 1963 as a systems analyst, serving in multiple jobs at various federal agencies. After retiring from WISE in 1981, he was a Weather Bureau senior meteorologist until 1989, when he stepped down to work as a professor and vice president at the University of Colorado. Bain received honorary doctorates from University of Colorado and the University of Pennsylvania in 1999.After leaving the Weather Bureau in 1985, he taught for one year at the University of Virginia and then taught at the University of Colorado. He was also appointed consultant to the University of Delaware, following retirement from WISE.Bain died on January 11, 1998.

 == Life and work ==  
 Capdevant was born in Étienne-Maritime, Rohan and studied zoology at the Collège de Lorraine and the University of Paris. He is considered the originator of the term merino wool ( hence the color of capdevants'ruffs ), a luxury cotton and wool product of the mid-1700s that received wide acceptance after obtaining international attention and acceptance. His scientific work mainly centered on the history of floras, especially those of mountain gorillas ( gorillas, orangutans, and rhesus monkeys ) and certain animals of tropical Africa. The dayfaunas he visited included the forests of Asia, the Karakoram ( Afghanistan ) and Borneo. He also studied the flora of Madagascar, Sunda Islands and Thevaland.In 1832, at age 26, he completed his first major scientific work, a monograph of the plants of the Australian Parthenogenetic Gardens in Bagdad. It was intended to introduce and simplify the geographic arrangement of plants in the garden. This monograph included an account of the human fossil remains found in the gardens. Capdevant's homestead on Alpinac Hill in New Jersey, where he became famous, also recorded the remains of the first hominids known from India.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
   
 Capdevant's work led to a series of publications that were of great scientific importance. Many of the collected plants in the parthenogenetic gardens of the Dutch East India Company in India came from Africa, particularly Africa's mountain gorilla species. These fossil species include :

 = Muhammad Husain Shakir =  
Mohammad Husain Shakir ( 27 December 1881 – 25 July 1961 ) was an Indian classical scholar and scholar of Mughal philosophy. He is well known for his contributions to both history and modern philosophy. He made significant contributions in his field and gained popularity as a former student of eminent scientists such as F. C. Leighton, E. A. Rankin and Richard Henry Rorty. He was known for his development of three-dimensional systems in Mughal Philosophy.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
 Shakir was born in Delhi, India, on 27 December 1881.  
 He was one of six children born to Subedar J. Shakir ( then a school teacher and later a journalist ) and his wife, M. B. Shakir. His elder brother, A. R. R. Shakir, was an Indian diplomat, musician and composer. His sister, Kadab, was a native of Kolkata. Shakir graduated from a grammar school in 1890, before moving to the University of Calcutta for education. He earned a PhD from the University of Calcutta in 1893 and a doctoral degree in Philosophy in 1905. He later moved to Lutyens University in Calcutta and taught there till his retirement from the University. He published his two most influential works in the early 1900s, with his doctoral thesis on Principles of Mughal Philosophy ( 1905 ). In 1913, he married Wajid Shaikh, a British social scientist and a Lutyens alumna.He was the author of a number of philosophical works, including On Being a Particular, The History of Thought of the Composition, and The Knowledge of Time ( 1921 ). Shakir is most famous for The Knowledge of Time, a book in which he aims to explain how people see the world according to how they live their lives. It is a great popularizer of the notion that thinkers work on questions and problems at their core, rather than making complex judgments about them. He was also the co-author of Syed Aga Khan Mujtaba Ahadith ( 1953 ), a study of Raja Bakhsh Ahmad, a leading Shafi al-Kashani.  
 In 1952 he established the Department of History of Philosophy at the Lahore University and was its first Director. A second and later revised version of the book was published in 1964. He died in India on 25 July 1961.

 = Iva Sharaf =  
Iva Sharaf ( 3 June 1837 – 18 May 1922 ) was an Israeli historian and academic. She was born in Cairo, Egypt. She became an Egyptologist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem ( HUJ ) and was an award-winning authority on the cultural and material treasures of Israel. In collaboration with her husband, professor Joseph Sharaf, she served as the chair of the Department of Archeology, Palestinian Exploration and Antiquities, and several others. She studied ancient Egypt under Margaret Hutton, the founder of Egyptology, with whom she met, and whose findings influenced her early work on the Israelite archaeological heritage. She was appointed in 1908 to the Jewish Publication Society's Chair of Egyptian Literature in Israel. After the First World War, she became a United States civilian foreign service employee. She died in Jerusalem of leukemia in 1922.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Iva Sharaf was the first of seven children born to Arab Hebrew students who immigrated to Palestine as early as 1869. According to a 2005 BBC Radio interview, my older sister Elisabeth was a lively woman who could travel and perform in Hebrew with complete fluency in at least 14 languages. Her brother, also named Yeboosh, later went on to join the Israeli military and teach at a yeshiva near Tel Aviv.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Iva Sharaf attended the Hebrew school in Cairo where she was friends with Nadia Bricfalus and Anna Serendi. She was a student at the Oriental Institute of the Hebrew University ( HUJ ) and at a Hebrew language school in Berlin. She held a Ph.D. in 1879 from HUJ on material from the tomb of Joseph Hayyim of Jerusalem. Sharaf was the first woman student to study in Berlin, and the first Jewish student to study in Paris. In 1885 she married Joseph Sharaf. They both lived in Jerusalem.  
   
   
 == Contributions to the Israeli antiquities ==  
 Sharaf's research concentrated on the Egyptian material and culture of the Second Intermediate Period ( 15,700–10,000 BCE ). Many of her findings concerned the geography, anatomy, stratigraphy, architecture, and inscriptions in the Great Pyramid of Giza ( 3,000 BCE ). Through the writings of Pierre Brion and Robert Howarth she was able to visualize a living Egyptian civilization in images. She was the first Israeli to send full manuscripts of her work to other scholars in other countries. In 1905, she wrote a volume on the Early Period, which continued work on the greatest Egyptian civilization of all time, the Egyptian Library of the Second Intermediate Period.  
 In 1913 she was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Palestine Antiquities Authority. In the 1930s, she worked in Jerusalem on the foundation of a new Egyptian museum. She was a founder and first chair of the Department of Egyptian literature and archaeology, the chair of the Department of Political Science at HUJ, the Chair of Oriental Studies at the HUJ, and the Chair of the Department of Egyptian and Near Eastern Studies at Yerushalayim.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Sharaf is commemorated in the Hebrew name of an antiquities trench in Lebanon, the village of Rayfat, now in southern Lebanon. A street, `` Kibor Sharaf '', in Jerusalem is named after her.

 == Life ==  
 He was the son of the Swedish writer and sculptor Nikolai Lebel, and his wife, Rose Lebel, daughter of the Liberalist legislator Kurt Lebel. He studied at Theresianum, Göttingen, and the Pontifical Lateranum. After studies at Rome, Paris, Hamburg, Vienna and Rome, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1868.Lebel was a member of the Society of Jesus from 1888.  
 His son, Jean-Pierre Lebel, served as the Jesuit apostolic envoy to France and France sent Jean-Jacques Lebel to study at the Sorbonne in 1874. He was appointed minister of non-scholastic studies and until his death in 1881 he served as the school rector of the Sorbonne.  
 He died in Vilnius, Lithuania, of a stroke.Lebel is remembered primarily as a theologian. He opposed the idea of the supernatural as an `` intelligible quality '' : such thinking, he argued, leads to an epistemological pessimism which leads to ignorance and relativism. He is known for his efforts to preserve the Thomistic tradition, for the openness of his teaching, for his research on the subject of faith, and for his collaboration with the Jesuits.  
 He was the episcopal translator of the work of Saint Thomas Aquinas, for which he obtained the magister seal of the Roman Curia.

 = Auguste Valéry =  
Auguste Valéry ( 29 September 1829 – 8 January 1902 ) was a French pioneer of the Neo-Georgian schools of philology and linguistics. He was a scientist of classical philology in the region, a leading specialist of the period when Greek and Babylonian were used as a common language.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Poitiers ( Poitier-Foucauld ), where his father, a colonel of the French army, grew up. His grandfather, in 1804, took him to the French East India Company territory and he was employed in work in the workshops of Jaques-Louis Augereau in Tripoli ( 1815–1818 ), now part of the French colony of Tunisia. After the departure of the army, he studied at the Sorbonne, obtaining a doctorate with a thesis on `` The Creative Genius of Aristotle '', which gave a better description of the mind of the philosopher than any previous work. In 1847, the Jewish section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts held him as their guest.  
 In 1849, he obtained his habilitation at the Sorbonne, where, with the assistance of the leading pedagogue Augereau, he worked to modernize the literary studies of a confused and backward tribe of French people who had no previous educational capital. Valéry began his career as a teacher and secretary of the Montmartre School. At this time he met and married the widow of a farmer. As a literary critic, Valéry devised a French system of comparative philology, based on a grammar and a theory of speech. In this work, he traced the difference of ancient languages, comparing its grammatical structure with that of modern languages ; and elucidated and elaborated upon the later, childlike speech of Hebrew and other Semitic languages. He was the first to set forth the major core elements of Greek and Babylonian, as they had developed from prehistory up to the time of Alexander the Great.  
   
 He left for Constantinople, where he made collections of the Babylonian language and edited the `` Catalogue des mouvements archéologiques des régions Assyriens '' ( 1853–58 ), subsequently published as Echige och hordomarktige der Babyloner-Religionskunde, 1–4 ( 1856–59 ). In 1868 he received from the Empress Catherine the Wood

 He was the co-author of three books in different languages about the geology of Tuscany. Among these is Die Thiere und ihre Periode der Hauptstellung in Tuscany ( 1891 ), based on a trip he took in 1887 to investigate the fossils of Telli and Apulia, to which he also wrote Über ihre Hydrothermalen aus den Italien und der Palau. The Tuscany expedition in 1888 was a great success, and the mineral germanium was named after him in 1891. He was the first to observe and describe the formation of mountains by the injection of alkaline salts into sandstone and the initial failure of this process in southern Europe.  
 Mueller studied geology and was assistant professor at the University of Halle in 1882–1887. From 1889 to 1893 he worked at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow and Vienna. In 1893 he was promoted to professor. In 1899 he was made a corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences. In 1899 he was awarded the Honorary Life Member of the Geological Society of America. From 1894 to 1914 Mueller was associated with the Physical Geology Department at the University of Bonn.

Ralph Walker ( April 12, 1846 – October 8, 1906 ) was an American bacteriologist, prominent for developing the Walker–Luftle formula.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Walker was born on April 12, 1846, in Washington, D. C., to Baptist minister Seth Walker of Greenville, North Carolina, and his wife, Susanna Allen. Walker finished high school in Niles, Illinois, and studied medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He then went to the University of Chicago to study bacteriology and microbiology at Johns Hopkins, where he was the first to use live typhoid bacilli as a means of culture.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After completing his degree in 1872, Walker worked as a physician in Jackson, Mississippi, and New Orleans, then moved to the University of Michigan where he was an assistant professor from 1873 to 1877, and an associate professor from 1877 to 1881. He remained at the University of Michigan until his death. During his final years, Walker was involved in bacteriological research at the Military and Naval Medical College in Washington, D. C. and in the Army Medical School at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. He was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1897.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Although many of the major advances in the microbiology and bacteriology of the 1870s were taken up by Walker's former colleague Theodore Berry Harter, there are a few notable names that trace their roots back to Walker. In 1883, Walker and William R. Carter were among the scientists who analyzed nearly 2,000 bottles of wine stored in a warehouse at the University of Michigan. The authors attributed their estimate that the wine contained 9 % alcohol to residual yeast at the bottom of the bottles, and acknowledged that they had done this `` without ” the benefit of seminal work by Berry Harter.

 == Biography ==  
 Born in Dolha, Burma, Rangat studied at the principal lyre school in the capital Rangoon.  
 In 1922 he was appointed first organist at the Ekpet village church in Ongkkak. In 1925 he was elected to the central organ conducting the church choir. In 1930 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for music composition. The prize was described by William Gilpin as `` his most honored achievement ''. Rangat also taught at the University of Minnesota where he was president and at the Dinguin Sanklang University where he was made the university's first president.  
 On July 8, 1948, in order to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the foundation of the Burma National Research Institute, Rangat performed a recital with a Chinese classical band to a large crowd at the Mar Jimmari station. He accompanied the performance with a poem as well as music by composers such as Jiang Nie-lin, Chung-liang Chia-ching, Tain Soe Yim-kwan and Nguyễnh Đức Bey. The poem, before it was read by the audience, was called `` While We May Be Good '' and the transcript read, `` In He ( 5 hours ), I have the word Love in my mind.  
 In the evening, I would never take you on a merry vacation. While we may be good we may not be good enough. To our everlasting heart we owe this beautiful new life. `` In 1965 he became dean of music at Amritsar University of Science and Technology.In May 1969 he was made a Companion of Honour. During the peak of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966 he was placed under house arrest in Chiang Mai until May 1978. The court granted him a few months of freedom on the condition that he do not take part in any political activity in order to avoid persecution. His fellow students at Dinguin Sanklang were supportive of Rangat's constitutional rights and renewed his teaching contract at the University of Minnesota. He died on 5 November 1970, when his house caught fire.  
   
   
 == Compositions ==  
 Rangat's extensive repertoire spans from classical Chinese to folk songs. From 1924, Rangat wrote a number of traditional Chinese organ sonatas, composed with Huixing's first organ student, Huixing Pi. He was also the co-author of several songs, some of which were published in his five popular vernacular English editions of the works of the period.

 = Focussed solely on nuclear fission, Duke C. Calvert ( 1933–2008 ) did little to attract attention to the need for caution and further research into both fission and the role of radioactive isotopes.  
 In 1934, Calvert suggested that high pressures of nuclear fusion might lead to powerful fission reactors, but that only it be brought to full power, at a rate of between 500 and 1,000 Gy. His proposal was then republished and translated into the original Russian and French.  
 His next book, The Century of Disaster, argued that nuclear fission could be harnessed to power an interstellar mission to Mars, but even that would involve major alterations to the physical infrastructure of the Red Planet.  
 In 1935, Calvert went on a double-length expedition to the Moon, studying and theorising about lunar and Martian processes. In one of his first recorded appearances at the Imperial College, London, he was hailed as an `` unsung hero '' by crowds at the club. In 1937, Calvert attended the nuclear physics conference that Albert Einstein was attending in Vienna that year. There, Calvert gave a speech about the need for continued investigation of the hidden dangers of nuclear fission.  
   
   
 == Briefcase for Energy Need ==  
 Duke Calvert set up an apparatus for delivering the energy from the atomic bomb in an emergency suit, but later said that it was a joke and fell flat on its face in the Moscow airfield. When Victor Gollancz started a similar device, he did not use the actual bomb, but used a portable hydrogen bomb instead. Calvert conducted a similar demonstration in London in 1935. Calvert also developed the concept of the `` harness '' – a device that could transfer the energy directly from the atomic bomb to the device by exploding it with hydrogen, generating a very large amount of energy. Calvert theorised that this sort of reactor would be practical, and he paid for the spectrographs. He then suggested to the High Commissioner for Nuclear Research in Washington that a reactor of this type could be built with few ecological risks, as a part of the Bombardment Programme, which was a massive disarmament campaign carried out by the government to promote a peaceful civilian nuclear energy industry.

 = William Gibbons (theologian) =  
William Gibbons ( 15 December 1603 – 29 May 1649 ) was an English theologian, and one of the first and most influential Puritans. The following section contains all of Gibbons'sermons.  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Gibbons was the son of a gentleman farmer, and was born at Stoneham, Leicestershire, on 15 December 1603. Gibbons studied theology in London, studying the works of Charles Fauconius, Thomas, Webster, Thomas Bayly, Robert Boff and John Yardley. His father sent him to the church of Porthcurno, Hertfordshire, but soon returned to the family farm in Hartwood, Hertfordshire, where he soon commenced to preach and write.  
   
   
 === Church career ===  
 Gibbons was a professor of divinity at the College of Hertfordshire. He was ordained to the ministry in 1618 and was appointed rector at St. Gregory's in Winchester in 1620. In 1623 he returned to Westminster, where he preached three years until he retired on 28 January 1626. He returned to Glastonbury as a priest in 1638. He made another disputation in Westminster. He died there on 29 May 1649.  
   
   
 === John Squire ===  
 Gibbons was the nephew of John Squire ( 12 October 1631 – 23 December 1671 ) and grandson of the Rev. John Squire, and sister of the Rev. William Squire. John Squire died on 21 December 1671, leaving John Gibbons a significant portion of his family.  
   
   
 === Bishop's Priory ===  
 Gibbons was consecrated bishop of High Court in Hertfordshire on 17 June 1622. He was removed to Westminster on 12 February 1630 ; he was re-appointed rector on 19 May 1634, and was made deputy pastor at High Court in 1639. His disputation was an ecclesiastical one and devoted himself to the general outline of the late history of Christendom. Gibbons'approach to orthodoxy was liberal, using material drawn from recent tradition. Although the protestant congregation was made by Queen Elizabeth I to withdraw its support, Gibbons was not present when her religion was denounced as heretical by Richard Rylands ( after long discussions in the convocation chamber ). Gibbons married Rebecca Beck ( b. 1738 ) in Hertfordshire in 1641, and they were divorced in 1649. In 1650 he was confirmed to the rectorship of Water Street. He was again rector of High Court in 1659, then of St. John in 1663, and in 1667 became vicar at Mansfield.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Gibbons was strongly opposed to the Reform Acts of the Nineteenth Century. He wrote against them and tried to hold the reformed church together in various ways.Gibbons founded several congregations and subsequently developed his own evangelical ministry, and was much influenced by T. S. Eliot, who had successively preached to various congregations at his home at Eaton's Lane, in Bury St Edmunds ( Oxford ).  
   
 The volume on Gibbons was published under the pseudonym David Towson ( a mixture of `` Gibbon, with ear spurs '' and `` Towson, a little previous to 1688, had painted this portrait of Sir John Henry '' ), with several later revisions by John Garnett ( 1666–1740 ), and was never publicly published. The second edition is held by the Chelsea and Clapham Evangelical Church Museum.

 = Elias Sperling =  
Elias ( `` Edward '' ) Sperling ( June 17, 1870 – May 13, 1956 ) was a Norwegian neurosurgeon.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Sperling was born on June 17, 1870 in Annvik by invitation from his father, Jens Sperling, professor of medicine at the Royal School of Theology and Surgery in Oslo.  
 From 1890 to 1896, Sperling worked at The Children's Hospital of Oslo and served as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Oslo. From 1896 until 1915, he was a researcher at the University of Copenhagen and in this capacity made the first observations of hepatitis. In 1914 he moved to the Rockefeller Foundation Medical School.  
 Sperling spent the first half of the 20th century as a pioneer of optometrist therapy for orthopedics. He also invented or edited at least 125 research papers and the first paper on patient response to spinal injections of cranial nerves and petechiae from small elephant brains.  
 Between 1925 and 1940, Sperling served as Professor of Physiology, Medicine and Psychology at the Medical College of Oslo, where he published over 150 research papers and edited the journal Operatve medden sommgjeligt. He was a founder member of the Pediatric Neurology Association and the Norwegian Medical Association and the President of the Norwegian Board of Medical Research.  
   
   
 == Controversies ==  
 Sperling's behavior was thought to be driven by childhood self-imposed limitations on his intellectual and physical growth. In many of the published research papers on Sperling and his adult patients, Sperling referred to his patient's symptoms as `` maladaptive '' or `` peculiarly itchy and needlessly painful ''. However, his own father, however, disputed this characterization, explaining that `` Edward '' was eager to help patients and should not use such aggressive language as `` peculiarly itchy and needlessly painful ''. Sperling's own daughter died of brain cancer in 1932, which Sperling died of two months later.  
 Although neurologists and other experts have long claimed that neuroses result from neurogenesis rather than from maladaptive neurosis, Sperling argued that the suggestion that neurogenesis causes neurosis was not supported by the experiments and observation he conducted. Sperling's findings contradicted the hypothesis that neurosis was the product of neurofibromatosis, the fear of tumors, or a neurotic response to external adversity.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Sperling was married twice. The first marriage was to French neurologist Eugène Mariette Montagu de Candelage, who died of a heart attack while on holiday in Paris in 1914. His second wife, May Allena Sperling, was a Russian immigrant to Norway.

 = Aloysius Wesley Edwards =  
Aloysius Wesley Edwards ( 15 February 1821 – 23 May 1879 ) was a Protestant preacher and theologian born in Batavia, who gave up his office at Harvard College in 1884 to devote himself to missionary work.  
 Edwards was a pioneer in evangelism in England, the first American born in Asia to preach in a European country. He was called to lead the first Ibbets Minor Mission to France and Italy in 1872, where he established a church in Rome. Edwards died at Toulouse in July 1899.  
 He was influenced by Thomas Dobson and his approach to Old Testament studies.Edwards was the author of Principles and Scriptures of the English Language ( 1854 ) and English Folk-Lore ( 1858 ). He also helped found, with Dobson, The Ethical Sociology of Society ( 1861 ), also published in North America, and First Principles of the Administration of Religion ( 1863 ). A History of Mankind of the Beginning of the Twentieth Century : Concerning the Dispersal of Races ( 1904 ), a representative work of Edwards, was translated into several languages.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Edwards was the son of a London tailor and a daughter of Bishop John Smith, who was ennobled by the eldest son of William H. Edwards of Shreveport. He was educated at Shrewsbury Grammar School, London, and London Westminster College, Oxford, where he received his B.A. degree in 1839. From 1840 to 1841 he was engaged by Matthew Wesley in a succession of missionary journeys to Persia, India, China, Japan, Korea, and Japan itself, and brought home translations of the Chinese New Testament into English. On the first death of Matthew Wesley in 1842, the Wicke family of 18th-century Princeton, New Jersey, New York, and Minnesota found themselves the re-founded Presbyterian Church of America in 1849.  
   
   
 == Missionary career ==  
 In 1841, Edwards was chosen by Dobson as professor of biblical exegesis at Princeton and in 1845 was sent by the Royal Society of Edinburgh to India to aid in the publication of the works of an English master, John Allen, on The Baptist in India.  
 In 1863 Edwards became Bishop of Bootham, Cornwall, the diocese of which he continued until his death, in 1893.He was the author of Principles and Scriptures of the English Language ( 1854 ) and English Folk-Lore ( 1858 ). Edwards established, with Dobson, The Ethical Sociology of Society ( 1861 ), also published in North America, and First Principles of the Administration of Religion ( 1863 ), two of the earliest work-books on American religion. A History of Mankind of the Beginning of the Twentieth Century : Concerning the Dispersal of Races ( 1904 ), a representative work of Edwards, was translated into several languages.Edwards was a member of the Free Church of Scotland and the Free Church of England and a Member of the Irish Free Church of Ireland.

 = William Stone (composer) =  
William Clay Stone ( 11 August 1869 – 9 May 1925 ) was an English conductor and pianist. He was notable for his pioneering approach to orchestral composition and worked in London until his death.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Stone was born in Camden, London, where his father was a piano virtuoso, conductor and schoolmaster. His father worked for the Royal Observatory ( now the Royal Liverpool College of Music ) and his mother taught at Camberwell School for Boys. In 1875 he entered The Royal Academy of Music, Kingston upon Thames ( now the Royal Academy of Music ) where he graduated with First Class honours in 1878 and was awarded a Fellowship of the Academy in December 1879.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The British music critic Thomas Hamill commented, `` As well as producing this year's striking, magnificent symphonic suite, Beethoven in C Major oratorio, a great many splendid plays have appeared in his many years since passing through that respected institution, and when he was away from St John's College, London, his works were set for many years. '' A popularist was heaped upon the arches of The King's Chapel at St Paul's Cathedral, while alongside his other notable works, he made the acquaintance of the recently married Lady Grace Hoole.  
 The 20-year-old Stone had first been approached by Henry Pickering, the conductor of the London Philharmonic, who offered him a position as conductor at The Royal Academy of Music in August 1881. He married his first wife of 32 years on 1 December 1884. Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter : Harry with who he had two daughters and two sons with Edith with whom he had a son, and Colin with whom he also had two daughters.  
 After the marriage, Stone began to work closely with Pickering on his works. He was instrumental in establishing relations with the composer as well as securing appointments on the London Chamber Orchestra.  
   
   
 == Orchestral career ==  
 After his resignation from The Royal Academy of Music, Stone took a position as Principal Conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ( now the Royal Philharmonic Society ). He was also created conductor of a concert choir which would have traditionally been conducted by an accompanist in St John's College, and served as head of the London Philharmonic from 1891-1897. Stone travelled widely as an important adviser to the composer, notably on recording sessions during his first term at The Royal Academy of Music and his return to the Boston Philharmonic, including playing an unaccompanied cello concerto for his first recording, in 1909, two years after the Boston Philharmonic disbanded.  
 Stone conducted the Op. 37 String Quintet ( 1917–19 ) and the 10 Symphonies ( 1920–24 ) which he was set to conduct during the Mendelssohn-Warner String Quartet, as well as the Tenth Symphony, which he succeeded in making during his brief tenure. He also conducted performances of Thalia's Theatre ( 1919–20 ) and the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Concert Pieces and the Elegy for the Dying Lady. On his return to London, Stone hosted the Gerhard Richter and Paul Hindemith String Quartet ( 1924 ), which was set to feature the Manchester Symphony Orchestra.The LSO was disbanded in 1935. He was succeeded as principal conductor by Walter Glasberg. However, it is believed that in later years he would have returned to orchestration.

 == Life and career ==  
 He was born at Coventry, the son of B. Kuttner, a Black Bartonshire doctor and later Home Secretary, and his wife Martha ( née Calloway ), daughter of James Calloway, Lord Lieutenant of North Yorkshire. His younger brother, Hugh, later served as a Cambridge Astronomer.Kuttner entered St. John's College, Cambridge at the age of 16, graduating MB ChB in 1897 with a first in hand engineering. In 1899 he took the first degree, first in geology. In 1907 he was awarded the Edmund House Medal, and in 1909 he was awarded the Russell Medal by the Mineralogical Society of London. Kuttner taught at Saint John's University from 1910 to 1915, and from 1914 to 1920 was president of the Royal Institution of Mines. He was awarded a PhD from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1925. He later served as lecturer in mineralogy at Westfield College, Oxford and Clark University in Glasgow. He was educated at a number of universities and won the silver medal from the First International Mineralogical Congress in Paris in 1931.After completing a master's degree in commerce at the London School of Economics, Kuttner was engaged in developing commercial interests for a year in Egypt. Here he met Dorothy. They married on 1 May 1915. At the outbreak of World War II, he stayed with relatives in Denmark. At the outbreak of World War II, Kuttner returned to England and became a lecturer in industrial geology at U.K. mining engineering colleges.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 In 1916, when Kuttner was invited to become a member of the Mining Science Board of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( now called the Mining Research Council ), he was already involved in study and developing mineral development in British North Africa. He worked for ten years in Egypt as head of the US firm Mela Goodrich, developing production lines for the British firm Cottrell in India, and developing the Nigerian plant Merck Royal Charitable Foundation's phosphate refining plant. In 1918, at the University of Manchester, he and his family relocated to the United Kingdom. From 1922, he worked as a consulting geologist for the Guggenheim and Rothschild Foundations in New York City. His professional training included nine years as head of mineral properties at Guggenheim Jewellers. During World War II, Kuttner worked at the Water District of Montreal, and became head of the Suez Mineral Investigations. As one of the architects of America's Great Depression, Kuttner provided technical support to the postwar banking system. He resigned his membership of the Mining Science Board in 1940, but was appointed professor of mineralogy at the London School of Economics. His research of new minerals and botany earned him the Mine Doctor of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his highest honour.  
 In 1957, at the age of 95, Kuttner retired to Manor Park, near Mayfair, in a country house that was originally purchased by his family. He and his wife lived in Mayfair for the remainder of his life and continue to write and lecture. In the last decade of his life, he continued to support the Foundation for Natural History with his rare book collections, and was an active member of its board of governors.

Alexander Paul Williams ( 1 July 1837 – 27 March 1915 ) was an American physicist and mathematician best known for his work in spectral theory.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Haymarket, Illinois, the third of five children of Abram Williams and Elizabeth Jones. Abram and his wife, Imogene, had three children, Morris ( 1850–1908 ), Alexander ( 1850–1925 ), and John ( 1851–1907 ). Williams began mathematics at age five and was awarded his first book of pure mathematics at age ten. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Georgetown University in 1884, and his Ph.D. in 1885.  
 After a long career as a mathematician and mathematical scientist, Williams left academia to found the Howard Williams Observatory in 1901, a Manhattan project laboratory that eventually became the New Mexico National Laboratory. He was the President of the Astronomical Society of America in 1912, and the largest shareholder of AMCO ( American Meteorological Society ), a professional astronomical society, from 1908 to 1909. Williams worked on spectroscopy and inorganic spectroscopy and ultimately became interested in `` the nature of solutions '', becoming particularly interested in the concept of solutions of incompressible waves in a dispersive medium. He later said that it was his enthusiasm and inspiration for this topic that led him to discover what is now known as spectral theory, after Francesco A. Stekler of Brazil.  
 In 1913, Williams was appointed to teach and research in the Yale laboratory at the University of Chicago where he taught fundamental physics for much of his adult life. He then became the director of the Mount Holyoke Laboratory and the first Director of the Department of Physics at Yale ( 1901–1910 ).  
 In 1924, Williams was awarded an honorary degree from Yale College, which he had attained with a first-class undergraduate degree, which was the first bachelor's degree awarded to a graduate student in the United States, by John Roebling, the only recipient of the Charles R. N. Luby Award, created by the American Physical Society.  
 During World War II, Williams worked at the National Bureau of Standards. After the war, he was appointed Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he presided over the Optical Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory for 37 years. After World War II, he served in two senior positions at the Department of Defense, as Chairman of the Measurement Branch and as Secretary of the Office of Naval Research.

 Bonney de Lionne studied medicine at the University of Geneva from 1882 to 1886. She also obtained a position as medical instructor at the clinic of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle ( later known as the Faculté de Médecine ).  
 She specialized in ophthalmic diseases, which included non-blindness, keratoconjunctivitis, and phrenology. While living in Geneva, Bonney de Lionne was an advocate of the use of infrared and ultraviolet technology for medical purposes, after which she was called to work for the military. After a year in the army she accepted a position as medical advisor for the Federal Government of Geneva. In 1886, she was the first person to introduce infrared spectroscopy to biomedical research in Switzerland.In 1886 she proposed the invention of the first color camera for the use in medical research. She was the first person to be awarded the Gerson medal by the Royal German Academy of Sciences. Bonney de Lionne was also the first person to use optical astigmatism as a visual aid in optometry, using them for the first time during studies of refraction and refraction coefficients of materials. In 1893 she was the first person to demonstrate the optical duetting, using argon as an interference filter. In 1905, after having been a member of the Swiss Academy of Sciences since 1887, she was promoted to full member.

Luigi Bernardi ( 19 October 1871 – 15 February 1946 ) was an Italian mathematician, and one of the founders of modern algebra. Bernardi was born in Corang, Moravia. He was a student of Jakob Fredy Parekh at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He became an assistant professor in 1881 and was made one of the first professors at the newly founded Collège de France in 1899.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early years ===  
 Bernardi was born at Parma, Italy. From 1900 to 1906 he studied law and physics at the Pontifical Gregorian University, graduating in 1903 with a doctorate in philosophy. From 1906 to 1908 he was a Professor at the Colombo University of Mines. In 1909 Bernardi accepted a position at the Collège de France, and during his stay in Paris he defended the theory of the Fourier series in two separate papers published in the Review des Relatifs d'agrégation. He became its first Provost in 1912, and served until 1917.  
   
   
 === Work in France ===  
 During his time in France, Bernardi held various positions, including that of Curator of the Institute of Mathematics. He was a strong supporter of Georges Cuvier and promoted in 1916 the Mémoire sur l'analyse des quotients de la théorie appliquée à la théorie de la bêcher sur la transfusion du mouvement leçon, and the work on the Theory of squares published in Leçons relatifs ( 2 volumes ). These articles gave occasion to several discussions with Oppenheimer and Ludendorff on the mathematical relations between functions, functions, and sums.  
 In 1921, Bernardi was appointed lecturer at the Institut de physique du monde, where he succeeded Parekh as Professor of mathematics. In 1925, he became professor of mathematical analysis and physics at the University of Pisa, and remained there until his retirement in 1933.  
   
   
 == Other activities ==  
 In 1908, Bernardi gave a lecture at the Collège de France. He helped to put an end to a period of ideological disagreement between French mathematicians and German physicists, and proposed the notion of a Poincaré series ( based on the principles of Theorie de physique et de statisme ).In 1927, he became co-founder of the Paris institute of theoretical physics ( CRS ). There he published his influential work Recherches sur le durant du theory de physique expérimentale and realized the importance of Fourier series in their theory. In 1939, Bernardi was among the signatories of Émile Durkheim's On the Essence of Philosophy, who emphasized that the positivist philosophy of the 18th century had greatly distorted the scientific methods of the 20th century.

 = Konrad Trier =  
Konrad Friedrich Hermann Trier ( 20 September 1883 – 16 November 1974 ) was a German physicist and discoverer of neutron interactions.  
 He was born in Basel. In 1907 he received his doctorate from the Technical University of Munich under Alfred Siemens. In 1914 he started working with Karl Albert Gottlob Werner and Charles James Fogg at the University of Cambridge. In 1921 he received his habilitation from the University of Leipzig.  
 Trier is best known for the Trier–Einstein combination. This arrangement allows neutrons to be emitted from a neutron source which is surrounded by matter. An electron can not therefore decay inside a neutron generator as it can only emit neutrons from the outside. This was discovered by Reinhold Messner and Nobel Prize winner Harold T. Compton in 1925. In 1923, the discovery led to the realization that the interaction between hydrogen nuclei and a neutron produces the active nucleus and thus, the required mass of the nucleus.In 1946, his group discovered the `` strong negative interaction '' in supersymmetry that results when pairs of elements are released from a solid state of matter that is composed of a chemical bond. Trier used data from pulsed nuclear physics, the spin tunneling method, and the debye mass function to prove that the interaction in a nuclear reactor should always produce the major component of the gamma ray.  
 He worked on M-theory of proton emission, currently known as Trier's equations for proton decays.  
 Trier died in Jena, Germany on 16 November 1974.

 In 1891, Els became acquainted with Sidney Weinberg. The two began to exchange correspondence ; Weinberg requested Els to join his study group and had Els enrolled at the University of Aarhus as a freshman in 1892. He studied psychoanalysis with Heinrich Baer, Abraham Ruckman and Vilhelm Haraldsen. Els also corresponded with Johann Malina Lofven ( 1831–1881 ), Wolfgang Kornhauser ( 1846–1911 ) and Wilhelm Mitterleben ( 1849–1912 ).  
 Els and Weinberg were commissioned in 1895 by Albrecht von Siemens to lead a psychoanalysis program at St. Peter's, the town in the Moravian mining district near Oslo, and in the beginning Els chose to study religion, his only field of study.  
 In 1909, they started a psychoanalytic training program at the New Religious Seminary. Since then Els taught at the university as well as at the Norwegian Association for Psychical Research and the psychology school in Aarhus ( 1951–1955 ). He also headed the psychoanalytic department at the new Polytechnic ( 1960–1972 ) and the Norway Regional Institute of Cognitive Therapy in Oslo ( 1975–1985 ). The doctoral thesis for the year 1980 in his original doctoral thesis was titled `` Interpersonal identity and speech ''.  
 Els founded the Oslo Psychoanalytical Training Clinic and placed its primary research area into the home. Els was named chairman of the Institute for Research in Psychoanalysis ( 1961 ). A protest against the apartheid South Africa for the first years of apartheid resulted in Els being fired in 1969.  
 A number of academic institutions were founded by him. The University of Aarhus, Norway, has named a department of psychology in honor of Els. He also founded a general practice in his honor. He also won several prizes from the Norwegian Society for Clinical Psychology and later from the Wissenschaftskrift für psychische und psychanalyse der Naturwissenschaften ( International Association for Psychoanalysis ).  
 In 1902, a conference titled `` The Psychology of Religion '' was held in Aarhus to identify theoretical contributions to the research and development of psychoanalysis. Els became the director of the conference in 1906 and became a founding member of the Norwegian Psychological Association ( NOP ).  
 In 1904, he published the article in which he proposed a two-stage method of exploring unconscious phenomena. The first stage involved clear and forcible exploration, the second stage—which concerned the emotional map—involved a more subtle, emotional and ritualized exploration.

 = Jean de Londel =  
Jean de Londel ( 21 November 1799 – 5 December 1885 ) was a French biblical scholar and Protestant theologian.Londel was born in Auchterard, the son of a butcher. He graduated from the Conservatoire des arts in 1815 with a degree in theology and later the Aix-en-Provence Conservatoire.  
 At that time Londel was deeply engaged in the work of Hérmann-Camille Héry ( c. 1680–1713 ). Following Héry's death in 1755, Londel took up his work full-time and he was ordained a priest in Auchterard in 1817. In 1822 he was elected a member of the Académie française. He was also a pioneer of the Bible translation and Germanische Bibel. Londel, along with François Braunecker, translated and published a series of thirty-nine Hebrew publications published between 1818 and 1824. A number of these were edited by Henri-François Lavy ( a contemporary of Londel ). His own translations remained unpublished until after his death. In 1829 he published a History of the English Bible published by Jakob Lyell and Sergius von Hristov, which was afterwards edited by Georges Cailleux.Londel is best known for his careful studies of biblical exegesis, the biblical prophecies in the Old Testament, and later the influence of such men as J. S. Mill and Jacob Haubelmann on the Protestant Reformation.  
 Londel held that Daniel 23 and 29–32 were prophetic and had particular significance for the present day. In the following years he developed a much more orthodox version of Daniel 4:1–3, though his earlier version did not differ much from that of Christopher Hooker ( 1654–1727 ). In his treatise de l'église apologique, published in 1826, he argued that the Bible had no authority over human reason, but only over God.Londel joined the Royal College of Pensacola ( RCP ) in 1823, and soon after became the fourth president. His lectures at the college were important for his theological studies. He remained affiliated to the RCP until 1832, when, upon the retirement of his first president, Victor H. van Hempel, the position was held by Gerard Seely ( 1803–1861 ). Seely was brought up in orthodox Protestant circles, and had close ties with the theologians of the faculty of classics. Some of his historical writings on the literary history of the Bible survive in the Bibliothèque royale d'Histoire naturelle et de l'histoire philosophique de Jean-Baptiste Londel. In 1836, he gained the title of professor in religious and practical theology.

Gabriel Jesman ( Hebrew : יידה אודני‎ ) ( 17 November 1802 – 10 November 1871 ) was a pioneering experimenter in anthropology in Britain, whose work in Britain has been very influential in terms of academic research.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 The son of a printing printer, Jesman was educated at Innes College in 1819, and St John's College, Cambridge. In 1827, Jesman first went to study medicine at the University of Leipzig.

 While attending classes at Cambridge, Jesman went to work as a private physician in Kent, and from 1834 to 1837 he was resident physician to John York, then the mayor of London. In 1837, Jesman was appointed a lecturer at Magdalen College, Oxford, from where he obtained his doctorate in 1842. Jesman continued to teach for the rest of his life in Oxford.  
 In 1852, when he returned to London, he took up his post as tutor at St Bartholomew's College, London, and taught for the next three years. In 1854, while still at St Bartholomew's College, Jesman accepted a post as professor of anthropology at Queen's College, Kingston upon Hull. When Henry Owen arrived at Hull in 1857, Jesman was appointed as his temporary assistant. While working at Queen's, Jesman published a considerable amount of work in the field of anthropology, especially in the field of comparative anatomy. In 1860, Jesman became a member of the Association of the Royal Anthropological Institute, and was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1864.  
 Jesman died in Hull.

William Edmund Richardson ( 28 January 1879 – 13 February 1940 ) was an American physicist and economist. He was Professor of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin, 1919–1923, and Academician of the University of Texas until his retirement in 1946.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Richardson was born in Jackson, Tennessee, and attended Louisiana High School. He graduated from McGill University in 1910, then entered Columbia College, Columbia, Missouri, as a mathematics major and received the bachelor's degree in 1910.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Richardson taught mathematics at the University of Mississippi from 1912 to 1917, and then from 1917 to 1922 at Columbia College, Columbia, Missouri, graduating with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1923. From 1927 to 1936 he was associate professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin.Richardson taught at the University of Missouri from 1935 to 1941, but was succeeded in 1941 by Paul Taylor. He then taught at the University of Texas at Austin from 1942 to 1947, and then worked as a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin until his retirement in 1946. He spent one year as chancellor of the University of Kansas and was admitted to the National Academy of Sciences, in 1962.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Richardson was the first to exploit the utility of building-stock pricing in the United States. His papers have been widely cited by economists and trade policy analysts, and his book The Future of Economics ( 1932 ) described the large ramifications of his theory. In those days, the price of technology did not represent the true market value, but rather the difference between what could be purchased at the unit price and what could be purchased as a percentage of the useful life of a particular product.He also developed a theory of the Nodal ( sector ) element that connects the technology sector to the economy's manufacturing. According to this theory, technological innovation moves in both directions, in one direction, leading to a rise in product demand, and in the other direction, a decline in demand.  
 Richardson had many publications on a wide variety of topics. The Handbook of Central Economic Ideas, an academic tool for managing the war in Europe from 1941 to 1945, was the first introduction to Richardson's concept of the Nodal. He also became widely known for his theoretical discussions on abstract economic theory and was considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of economics.By the 1950s, Richardson had played a leading role in shaping the campus climate at the University of Texas at Austin in 1957, especially in the free market system textbooks that were widely used. He had been a founder member of the academic Journal of Social Issues, as well as the author of numerous popular books and articles.

 He was born in Kew, London. He had a relatively low family income until he moved to New College, Cambridge in 1910. During the World War I, he served with the 1st Battalion The Royal Artillery.  
 He joined the First World War Medical Corps in 1917. After the war, he served in France during World War II. During the Second World War, he worked as a biochemist at the National Health Service and the Food Research Laboratories at Aberdeen University.  
 In 1946 he moved back to London to take a seat at Westminster Hospital as a Privately-owned Physician.  
 He subsequently developed his hypothesis that inflammation could be used to diagnose and treat specific ailments. He showed that removing ( or even blocking ) an area of an inflamed tissue would improve the symptoms of cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis, arthralgia, and testicular cancer.  
 In 1951 Westley helped establish a Salpêtrière Research Institute in the UK. In 1978 he received the Pour le Mérite.

In 1926 she graduated from the Karolinska Institut with a degree in physiology. Pfeiffer went on to continue her studies with Carl Friedrich Beyer and to obtain her PhD from the Karolinska Institute in 1933. She was promoted to professor at the Karolinska Institute after Beyer's death in 1941.In 1949 she became the first female professor of clinical medicine in the world, and became the first to lead the MSc department of biochemistry at the University of Lund, Sweden. She wrote a number of books, many of which became best sellers in Sweden. Her speeches during and after World War II were frequently used in university courses and in government education. In 1977 she received the Nobel Prize in medicine `` for the development of a new basic science in biochemistry. ''  
 She was also an advocate of women's participation in science. She was invited to lecture in European universities in the 1980s. One of her notable lecture notes is an aphorism written in 1946 by her husband Carl, which suggests that `` all scientists are women '' : `` For the future of humanity, we have to understand how women coexist within the scientific community.

 = Otto Mendelssohn =  
Otto Mendelssohn ( 4 February 1769 – 7 August 1844 ) was a German professor of physics, who died in Dresden on 7 August 1844.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Mendelssohn was born at Frauenburg in the Oder Province ( today in the Magdeburg Region ). He studied physics at Berlin and was a member of the Freie Gesellschaft. In 1796 he obtained a doctorate ( also part of doctorates ) in philosophy, and in 1800 received a habilitation of philosophy from the University of Munich.  
 Mendelssohn worked for two years in Munich, teaching theology and geology to wealthy students, and in 1801 he returned to Germany and founded the Deutsche Physikalische Gymnasium. In Dresden he was succeeded by Johann-Werner Schumacher. On 16 May 1804 he became professor at the Freie Akademie der Wissenschaften ( Academy of Sciences ) at Dresden, and in 1818 was rector of the same institution.After teaching theology and geology in Dresden for 30 years, he moved to the University of Göttingen in 1823, and then in 1836 to the University of Marburg. In 1840 he emigrated to England.  
 Mendelssohn wrote :  
   
 `` Some critics, speaking of the history of astronomy and its relation to the modern discovery of the Earth, say that Mendelssohn was the first to discover the elliptical orbit of Venus, and that it had preceded Newton's special theory of light. I fully agree with this view ; I consider Mendelssohn to be the first to prove to the world that the relation of motion of Mercury to Venus, which was first observed by Copernicus, has, indeed, an inverse degree ; and that he has also demonstrated its intermediate position in relation to the known latitude of our planet at the time of his methodical proof.I wish to prove the hypothesis now commonly held that the differential equation for the Earth has a circular relation to the latitudes of the stars. I have shown, in general terms, that the problem of so-called binary phenomena, common to the whole Universe, is no longer a fundamental one ; the relations of time, shape, motion and the position of objects in the known Universe are no longer a fundamental ones ; and therefore I conclude that if we can furnish any data that may assist the natural scientists in applying our general principles, we shall be able to arrive at a far more definite conclusion.

Edward Horne ( July 23, 1895 – November 30, 1977 ) was a professor of geology at Cornell University. His collection of Cretaceous rocks from Yellowstone National Park is known as the Henry Horne Collection.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Horne was born in Sussex and became interested in the geology of the Central Connecticut.  
 In 1908, after reading a paper about the Prehistoric Carboniferous North America he joined the Department of Geological Sciences at Cornell University. He subsequently taught and chaired the Department of Geological Sciences until 1941, when he was appointed Professor of Geology. He was an early National Park Geologist and an early Director of the National Park Service.  
 In 1937 he led a group of students from the University of Connecticut to Yellowstone National Park. The scientific team's primary focus was to search the sedimentary rocks and ridges of the park for fossils of animals, animals that lived in and around the park, and for those buried in the park's geologic formation. As the leading student group at the park, the group is known for their innovative use of thermometer-based techniques to characterize samples, analyze and record data on the geology, geomorphology, and preservation of the park. In 1945, the group published their first article, General Description of the Paleozoic Tethys in Yellowstone National Park.  
 While at Cornell University, he studied for three years under David Reynolds and E.G. Constable, and subsequently met both men. He developed the concept of `` Tip Top Studies '' in 1933, which combined research using thermometers and wooden thermometers as an analytical tool to determine time scales in sedimentary rock formation.  
 Edward and David were two of the founding members of the Museum of Vertebrate Paleontology, the archaeology and anthropology museum in the Yale University College of Arts and Sciences.In 1933 Edward married Patricia Mary Pierce, and became the father of a son, Edward Washington Pierce.

Gretta Emilia Kemper ( German : [ ˈjɛmɑtɑ ˈɛtjaɐm ˈkɛːn ˈteːr ] ; 28 March 1829, Ulm – 25 July 1912, Hamburg ) was a German physician, author, feminist, and suffragist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Kemper was born in Ulm, where her father was Professor of Physiology. Kemper began her medical studies at the University of Münster in 1859, where she received her doctoral degree in 1860. Her work in Vienna led to her appointment as a lecturer in 1864, and she remained as a full professor of physiology until her retirement in 1890. In 1867, Kemper served as president of the German Congress of Physiocrats, a position she held until her death.  
   
   
 == Science and philosophy ==  
 Kemper believed that the development of man came from the collaboration of evolution and patriarchy. On the basis of this argument, Kemper opposed sex work, treating women as autonomous individuals. She rejected the majority view that children were truly autonomous. Kemper believed that society and women would eventually evolve in a `` new '' way, where women's voice could no longer be heard by her superiors, and by then, women would no longer be free individuals.She defined the rights of women as `` that they should get their due rights, not as a property of their person or of their race ''. However, Kemper acknowledged that women were excluded from certain professions such as medicine, and that their political rights should be respected.  
   
   
 == Published works ==  
 Kemper published several philosophical works, including his most important work ( 1875 ), Über die Einfluss des Allgemeinen, der Materialitäts- und Naturwissenschaft, an exposition of the human drive, calling attention to the social and economic consequences of its development. Kemper's main literary contribution was Der Erweiter. The work was written in German and published in six parts, initially in three volumes and later in 12. According to Kemper's personal daughter, Alice Müller, its primary goal was to show women, and not men, how life is to be lived. The book was compiled during Kemper's own studies.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 In his daughter Alice's words :  
   
 So Gretta and Alice contributed two volumes to  
 a collection containing 20 original works by the two women—Edith Kemper, Poet ( 1870 ), translated by Horace Kneeland ( 1881 ), translated by Alice Müller ( 1881 ).Gretta Emilia Kemper died in Hamburg.

He collected for A. H. Hermann Hortus Zoologischer Gesellschaft Königlichkeit, the tenth edition of the Collected works of Franz von Harnack ( see Königlichkeit ).  
 In 1883 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( one of the 100 foreign members ).  
 His earliest botanical work, called the Abbildung in den natürlichen Organen ( `` Zoological and natural principles in nature '' ), was published in 1878. In the same year he made, in collaboration with Frederick Benjamin Galpin, a collection of 270 species from all parts of the world, together with an 8¼,000-page German dissertation ( German : Geschichte der Gesellschaft für Tierkräfte und Professoren, Ordnung durch Klasse und Krieg ). He made a second great multi-volume study in the Llewellynian families. He also published a work on ornithology and a separate treatise on the insects of Florida ( `` Insects of the United States and British Florida '' ) in four volumes, after his return to Britain in 1885.  
 As a novelist, he wrote many books of fiction, including the 1909 book A Thousand Beautiful Trees ( Auslegungen mit Gotteschichte der Elektrochemie, 1st edition, Frankfurt, 1894 ), a book that achieved almost universal popularity. In addition, his other notable works include several articles in Bauhaus periodicals.

Concord College Professor C.W. Mackin ( August 22, 1857 – November 27, 1931 ) was an American educator, most famous for writing the popular textbook, Teaching in the United States ( 1905–1908 ). He was known as the father of American experimental education.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 The son of Benjamin Mackin, an attorney, and Adeline Branden Heifetz, a naturalist, he grew up in the family farm, known locally as the Hispanics'Cottage. He received his B.A. from Concord in 1889, and M.A. ( 1892 ) from the University of Chicago. His undergraduate education was at the Wharton School of Finance ( business ), and from 1889 to 1895 he taught business administration at the Portland College, which is now Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
 In 1896 he married Priscilla Sanders Wilson, daughter of Phyllis Sanders Wilson, a pastor in Lowell, Massachusetts. They had four children : Dorothy Camilla Wilson ( 1895 ), Everett Priscilla Wilson ( 1899 ), Charles Edward Wilson ( 1901 ) and Elwood Wilson ( 1903 ).  
   
   
 == Teaching ==  
 In 1901, as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star and as a university lecturer, he began his collaboration with Henry Edmund Broad, who would go on to write most of the broad principles for modern teaching. In 1903, the first nationwide distribution of the second edition of the Textbook of Modern Education was released, and though being one of the final editions of teaching instruction, its potential scope was large, and great volumes on the subject were produced for it. As the teaching of evolution developed, this widely distributed textbook became a standard textbook. It came to be known as the `` Textbook of Modern Education ''. A companion book, The Teaching of Christian History, was released in 1903. The book was widely used during the next half century.

 In 1949, Naff was a National Research Council Research Fellow, where he led research efforts involving the study of the conformational and functional aspects of DNA. He also conducted a series of important studies on the structure and function of genes. His major contribution was the creation of a computational model of the large number of inducible steps necessary for DNA synthesis, a feat the researchers referred to as “ tying the knots ”. Together with fellow American, George Barnett, and I. P. Z-Huang, Naff developed a program, Aglar, which eventually contributed to the construction of a computer program called Multilocus Sequencer.Naff and Barnett published several publications between 1946 and 1956 and 1951 and 1955. During this time, Naff was also the first to make molecular modeling of protein complexes.Naff also designed a program which provided higher performance for basic and applied biology.

 = Heinrich Sachs =  
Heinrich Sachs ( 16 June 1859 – 11 November 1943 ) was a German mathematician. He was born in Alsace. He became interested in mathematics in school, and spent his early years teaching at the CIE Technical School in Vienna.  
 Sachs studied at the Technical University of Munich, studying under Ludwig Boltzmann, giving a thesis on rational functions on rational operators and integral calculus ( 1860 ). He obtained his doctorate in 1881.  
 In 1883, Sachs published his work on a series of questions concerning continuity of equations on the metric given by the famous series and its applications to the calculus of variations. He also did postgraduate work under A.E. Maunder at the Technical University of Munich. His mathematical papers included contributions to the Klein formulations, the theorems of general vector calculus, and the type theory of binary functions.  
 Sachs was interested in transcendental analysis and adopted it in 1884. He discovered the theorem of Singleton, before reaching Fermat's Last Theorem of 1906. Sachs published many papers concerning transcendental analysis as well, including a monograph on Hilbert spaces and a monograph on disjunction surfaces ( 1893 ). Sachs was a fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science and Letters, and a Fellow of the Mathematical Society of Edinburgh, Royal Society of London, and American Mathematical Society. He was also an honorary member of the Association Germanische Deutscher Akademie, the League der Physikalisch-Mathematik and the National Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  
   
   
 == Research and educational career ==  
 In 1906 Sachs published his Göttingen thesis on Integral Calculus with Jacob Boltzmann.  
 Sachs's doctoral work on differential equations, Real Solutions of Differential Equations and Unitary Solutions of Differential Equations, was the basis of his thesis and should be seen as an extended work of Lectures on Calculus. Sachs shared some of his former supervisor's interests : he developed the first non-harmonic proof of the Fermat's Last Theorem. His numerical solution for the Klein–Riemann integral in a simple subject ( For elliptic differential equations in a geometric form ), and proved that ( using approximation ) there are other solutions where both the analytic and harmonic parts of the equation are differentiable at the same time, with one ( unknown ) being the Fourier series. This included solutions for complex numbers and number theory. Sachs was elected a fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science and Letters in 1909. He contributed a paper on generalized differential equations ( 1911 ) to the volume On the approximations of diffraction for long waves.  
 Sachs died in Vienna on 11 November 1943.

 Elsa von Saint-Saëns was born on 19 January 1912 in the city of Heidelberg, on Dutch South West Europe. Her mother was Viljoaf St. Jean and she studied at the Eindhoven University of Technology ( 1918–1925 ).  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 From 1926 to 1938 she studied at a private university in Stellenbosch, South Africa. After graduation she entered the faculty of psychiatry at the King's College Hospital in London ( 1940–44 ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At the beginning of World War II in 1940, Stenbosch, South Africa, was part of the British Commonwealth colony. Stenbosch was under threat of occupation by the Nazis in September 1940 and only 2 days after leaving Germany Stenbosch was threatened and killed by the Nazis, the university was closed down, and Stenbosch family took refuge with relatives in England. Stenbosch moved to England in 1944 and became a psychiatry resident in London in 1946, teaching a seminar on Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. In 1946 she obtained her PhD in Psychology at King's College Hospital.After the end of World War II, Stenbosch returned to England. During this period she worked at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Bristol.  
 During this time she also became interested in the concepts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and in the measurement of stress, the use of complex variable methods and analytical medical subjects.Stenbosch moved to the University of Texas ( Austin ) in 1957, where she headed up the department of psychopathology, a group that became the flagship of the college of psychiatry. She moved in 1976 to the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford University and this time also became the focus of clinical research. During this time she published a landmark and influential book titled Development and Studies of the Function of a Lively Mind. She also was involved in a series of controversial publication, published in the 1960s and 1970s in which she published controversial findings, such as the findings that manic depression was a normal mental state and the recognition that schizophrenics had brain damage and deafness.  
 In 1969, the State of Texas received funding for the relocation of Stenbosch to the United States, where she was a clinician and researcher at the Cleveland Clinic.  
 Stenbosch moved to the University of Toronto, Canada where she took up positions as the Chair of the Psychology Department. There she focused her career in taking biobriefs in order to answer people's questions on their research and clinical backgrounds. She moved to then University of Birmingham and from 1972 to 1981 also was the Chair of the Psychology Department at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. In 1981 she joined the staff of Saint Marys Hospital in Jamaica and completed her PhD at Birmingham.  
   
   
 == Career milestone ==  
 In 1982 she joined the European Association for Mental Health and created the multi-disciplinary European Association for Psychiatric Research in Behavioral Medicine ( EAPBRIM ), for which she developed a unique treatment paradigm called the psychology of professionalism. In 1989 Stenbosch started a new phase in her life, through study tours of South America where she and other researchers studied the cultures and beliefs of the indigenous cultures, with the intention of better understanding the workings of the world of psychology, as one of the colleagues was going to go to Vietnam and suffer with post-traumatic stress disorder for 4 years. Her case was reported in the British journal Archives of General Psychiatry.She was also a champion of the creation of understanding the many facets of issues, history and cultural divisions, skills, abilities and dispositions that some people carry in order to cope with the realities of life. She was on many journalistic and medical stories, for example, discussing her experiences as a researcher for The Times newspaper on Mental Health Research.In 2004 she died in Jamaica from the complications of cardiac arrest, after a long illness.

 = Markus Messerli =  
Markus Messerli ( 2 March 1838 – 14 March 1910 ) was an Austrian naturalist and horticulturist.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Messerli was born in Mecklenburg, Württemberg, where his father was an engraver, as well as a researcher. From 1875 he studied at the Royal Prussian Academy of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.D. in 1880. From 1883, he traveled to Vienna and the Netherlands, visiting as many scientific expeditions as he could. Following his return in 1891, he continued his research in zoology, botany, flora and fauna of Europe and the Netherlands. From 1890 to 1896, he was head of the natural history collection at the University of Tübingen, and was a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Academy of Agriculture and the Royal Botanic Garden. In 1896 he created the first ( together with Kjell Barth ) textbook on botany, Geognostik. In 1898 he became honorary member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.In 1905 Messerli became the first to record the biodiversity of the Neisse Gulf region. For a time, he even surveyed the sea floor in Antarctica. The greatest care he gave to distinguishing species, as many of them had a huge impact on the ecology of their habitats, as did the genus Ephydropedis.  
 After the 1905 elections, Messerli was appointed provincial naturalist in the new administration of Rudolf the Bold, a vision he pursued with determination and perseverance. After his retirement in 1909, he moved to Brussels, where he also served as the director of the Regional Museum and as vice-director of the Natural History Museum in Bruges. He died in Bruges in 1910.

 Mackay left Oxford to take a position with the Zoological Society of London. There he conducted many field studies in Java, providing documentation of bird migration and development. He was also keen on animal husbandry. In 1932, the Zoological Society sent him on a field research trip to Central Sumatra. During this trip he produced a catalogue of the Gombein family of birds, and this worked for him in establishing a long-standing interest in the life history of birds. Mackay was awarded a Cuddeback Medal by the Royal Society in 1939. In 1944, Mackay returned to London as curator of the British Museum, becoming Head of the Severn Heritage and Nature Research Unit in 1949. In 1953, he returned to East Africa as a professional entomologist, overseeing the collection and management of insects. He also served as Director of the BMA's British Museum Division from 1961 to 1965. He was invited in 1957 to become a director of the East African Museum, a position he retained until his death in 1990. He was a Director of the BMA in 1972.

 = Gerard Teixeira =  
Gerard Teixeira Surgical Centre MD ( Lisbon, Portugal ) was a Portuguese surgeon and general practitioner. He was the first to perform surgical localization of congenital disease in humans, which has not previously been achieved in humans. Teixeira was born in Lisbon, Portugal on October 11, 1925. He graduated from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto in 1938, and received the degree of Doctor of Surgery in 1944. He was one of the founders of a pediatric hospital in Brazil. He also developed a method for making child remains with the help of X-rays from the abdomen. In 1950, he became the first surgeon in Brazil to donate fetal remains to international medical institutions, which were not allowed in the country at the time, in order to raise awareness of medical interventions in population health. In 1957, Teixeira opened a surgical surgical clinic in Vale do Leon, with a view to establishing this clinic within a few years. In 1967, Teixeira became the first professor at the Medical University of São Paulo, where he is remembered for his contributions in researching procedures for reconstruction of human body parts of all kinds, in post-mortem human anatomy. His first publication was published in 1959, titled, The organ utilization by diseases in primary childbirth, which was a commentary in which he criticised some people for believing that organ structures and the fetus are the same thing.  
 Teixeira was director of The La Vida Clinic, a private clinic that focused on the rehabilitation of many patients with congenital diseases, including diabetes, uremia, heart disease, ulcers, mental retardation, incontinence, and many others. He opened three locations of clinics in the federal department of Neurosurgery and Social Medicine in São Paulo ( 1971, 1973, 1977 ). He was also one of the founders of the Brazilian Developmental, Space and Disaster Health Institute ( BBDHO, now Brazilian Scientific Society for HIV/AIDS Research ).

 = Aubrey Coleman (physicist) =  
Aubrey Coleman ( 1900 – January 7, 1999 ) was an American physicist known for his contributions to the understanding of the structure of the molecules in nature.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Coleman was born in Albany, New York, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of New York, where he obtained the B.S. in Physics ( 1911 ) and Ph.D. in Chemistry ( 1912 ). From 1909 to 1914, Coleman was a physics professor at the Western Reserve University, serving there until the fall of that school in 1914.  
 From 1914 to 1920, he taught as an assistant professor at Western Reserve, serving from 1920 to 1927 as a department head.  
 In 1921, he was named lecturer in experimental physics at New York University, and taught until his death. Coleman was the first person to establish a program of laboratory courses in chemical and physical chemistry at the New York University College of Medicine and Dentistry.  
 He was the president of the Linnean Society of America, and held the positions of president ( 1934 ), vice president ( 1936–1941 ), chairman of the board ( 1940–1942 ), president of the New York City League of Scientific and Industrial Employees ( 1945 ), chairman of the board of directors of the National Research Council ( 1946–1949 ), a member of the Academia Sinica and the National Academy of Sciences, and president of the American Physical Society.  
   
   
 == Scientific research ==  
   
 Coleman's most influential research was in the theory of the reaction of a chemical compound with substances other than hydrogen and oxygen, emphasizing the critical role of the electric charge of the underlying `` silver ''. He developed the Coleman's approximation, which enabled scientists to distinguish between the colorless and colorless phases of an element by looking at its electric charge. This experiment introduced Coleman's theorems and gave the popularization of the concept of the ether.  
   
   
 === The Coleman's approximation ===  
 The Coleman's approximation is a chemical formula ( an abelian potential, AB ) obtained by substituting an electric charge of one and a negative charge of another for the water and nitrogen.It is derived by taking a solution of pure water, in which a dilute portion of oxygen and hydrogen is reduced to form hydrogen-one, and adding ( partial ) acid. Then it is replaced with an acid mixture consisting of both hydrogen and oxygen, and simultaneously salt and water. The result is a liquid. Coleman's formula has been used in many fields of science, for example, using it to explain the decay of fluorine.The Coleman's approximation, once properly adapted and expressed, applies to a wide variety of low-temperature, low-power, reactive systems, including carbons, the element uranine, electrolytes, nuclei, and molecules of chemical elements.  
 In 1932, Coleman introduced the Coleman's approximation for determining the critical temperature at which carbon, a dimeric compound, breaks down. In 1935, he found the critical temperature for bromine, a compound that binds bromine. In 1937, he introduced the Coleman's approximation for determining the critical temperature at which oxygen molecules break down, using a combination of light and thermoglysis.  
 In 1949, Coleman proposed a simple mathematical transformation to represent the experimental significance of the Coleman's approximation, which he called the Coleman's radical. His formula for the Coleman's radical is :

 Burgess was born at Hever near Lanarkshire and educated at Glasgow University, graduating B.A. in 1898, M.A. in 1903 and D.Phil. in 1905. He served with the Edinburgh Corps of Engineers, being awarded the Victoria Cross on 5 June 1917 and being promoted to Captain in 1918. He undertook further training at the Berlin Natural History Museum, where he attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in April 1921. In 1922, he was appointed in charge of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, as professor of botany and applied mineralogy and was appointed consultant to the Plant Council in October 1927. After four years at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, he retired to Norwich where he made a private collection of about 1,600 specimens of plants, of which the majority were in the Balearic Islands, the British Islands and Burma.  
 In 1917 he married Emily Mary Crane of Stoke Newington, Leicestershire. They had two daughters and one son. From 1933 to 1936 Burgess was employed by the Botanical Society of Great Britain, Norwich, to examine samples of mollusks that had been collected and sent to Britain by German scientists, mainly by Otto Neubauer and Adolf Hildebrand, together with the suggestion that this should be the basis of specimens being sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens. He also provided the specimens for the London Magazine the following year. Later in his career, Burgess co-authored a report on Mediterranean flora with John Sargant in 1936. His field work in the Malay Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, the Maldives and the Peninsular, and several trips to Ceylon made him noted as a specialist on the Malay archipelago. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1918 and his paper on Malayan vegetation was later recognised as 'one of the important statements on a subject discussed in the international scientific conferences that followed.'

 As he was not a trained zoologist, he had to work on largely self-directed work in the field. He was particularly interested in the long-tailed lark, with which he closely collaborated and observed. He published many papers and reports on birds and recorded his observations and observations-briefly on 63 occasions in total-over 150 years. During his tenure, he established new classes of birds, introduced species, and acquired a new field of study. He named the common woodpecker Barnacle ballista, Angora pala ( which he named after the house in which he lived ).He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Ornithologists'Union.

 = Friedrich Olav Koch =  
Friedrich ( Thor ) Karl Koch ( 20 June 1838 in Karlsruhe – 5 April 1924 in Stuttgart ) was a German economist, chemist and geneticist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Friedrich Karl Koch was born in Karlsruhe, the son of farmer Karl Koch ( 1816–1878 ) and Alice Marie Kremer ( 1812–1893 ). Friedrich was educated at the gymnasium and the public school. In 1864 he enrolled in the University of Tübingen and graduated in 1867, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1867. Later in life he worked as a professor of chemistry and botany at the University of Göttingen, where he was also a lecturer. In 1873 he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1884 he published the first of several influential works in the field of genetics : his Contributions to the Development of Adaptive And Altered Cytology, 1885. In his second volume he developed the concept of an `` active replacement '', and the nature of genetic requirements, to their most abstract form, which embodied the view that inherited traits are learned instead of acquired. The following year, his third volume, Verhandlungen über einige Untersuchungen in die Verhältniss zu einer Ergebnisse der Plasmodium, dealt with the inheritance of `` harmful '' variants. In 1870 he wrote über die Ethnographie und Untersuchungen auf die Genetische Inschriften ( Contributions to the Ethnography and Evolution of the Human Family ), which discussed the hybridization of certain breeds and what that would mean for humanity. Two years later he published, Verhandlungen über einige Untersuchungen auf die Einleitung der Naturwissenschaften ( Contributions to the Social and Economic Development of the Human World ), which was concerned with the migration of different races, particularly the non-European populations of the Middle East.  
 In 1873 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which he resigned in 1882. His role there was limited. He served as the society's president until 1883, and a corresponding member from 1886 to 1896. He wrote twice for the Jahrbücher Zeitung, the German periodical of the University of Berlin, which he edited. Koch's most famous work is the Two Methods of Erasure of Result and Interpretation, edited by his son, anthropologist Friedrich Koch ( 1878–1948 ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Koch married Sophia Horner in 1874. In 1900 he became a full professor of sociology. In 1905, he married Valentina Kühnel. He died in Stuttgart, aged 74.

 = Paul Kock =  
Paul Kock ( 14 December 1881 in Frönsvötn – 22 December 1960 ) was a Swedish chemist, mathematician and researcher, best known for discovering the Kock–Lehn law in 1932, a theorem of Kock and Ludvig Ulvaeus.Kock worked on a study of the chemistry of ozone, an important point of interest in the development of modern radiology. He studied helium and others in the field, and soon became a recognized authority on these elements.Kock taught mathematics at Pori University until 1930, when he became president of the university. Kock died in Stockholm, Sweden.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Paul Kock was born in Frönsvötn, County Stockholm, the son of Erich Kock ( 1821–1915 ) and Caroline-Bartolomé Perner ( 1850–1913 ). His sister Celine was named after him. In 1886, at age eighteen, he was hired to a research laboratory in Plönheim, where he worked as a research assistant under Jens Lehn, an influential chemist from Brandenburg, who introduced the Lehn–Kock law to Sweden. In 1888, Kock and Lehn published a seminal paper on a special category of benzoene. This became a standard method for studying the different types of benzoene from purebenzene. Kock and Lehn introduced the law, and the name now is to be found on some practical goods such as acids, stearic acid, butylene glycol, benzene glycol, butylene glycol-fumarate, acetylene glycol-amide, carnauba wax, castor oil, oil of xanthan gum and liquid rubber.  
 In 1899, after a contract with the university, Kock was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the newly established Karlsruhe University. Kock described his work on the structure of naphthalene, formed through polyvinyl dimethicone synthesis, in 1905, and introduced the law of Kock and Lehn ( the Kock coefficient ).  
 In 1912, he began to develop further his interest in chemistry and meteorology, but his schooling had not allowed him to fully pursue this interest until World War I. The Kock school in Karlsruhe taught mathematics and physical chemistry, and was originally meant to train future scientists. Although the school closed in 1923, Kock continued to hold meetings. In 1914, Kock published his initial findings, and received a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in Chemistry and Biology in 1919.  
 Kock was a major figure in the development of radar. His radar developments were a major stepping stone for all subsequent efforts to develop radiology.  
 Kock coined the Kock–Lehn theorem ( translation Kock–Lehn law ; see this article, though it may in fact refer to the law of Lehn and Kock ) and developed a theory of molecular structure. In 1937, he discovered a Kock-Lehn liquid crystal in which each crystal has an internal mirror surface. At the time of his death, Kock's liquid crystal was not known to be a new discovery, but only the first crystalline structure known. However, his fluid crystal was large and consisted of 93 layers of lattice, with 3×7-cm diameter of high refractive index and a solid crystal surface. In 1938, Kock was allowed to resume his work at the university, but at the time he was still the only non-scientist at the university in terms of `` basic research activities '' ( research subjects were all interrelated and included in the normal academic activity ).

 Patterson was born at Blackerton Road, Hertfordshire, the son of Leclow Patterson, a tailor, and his wife, Jean. He was educated at St John's School and Exeter Grammar School. In 1931, he earned a £5,000 ( £6,000 at that time ) teaching scholarship to study Physics at Trinity College, Cambridge.After working as a mathematician at the Imperial Meteorological Observatory in London, he took up a job at the Cambridge Atomic Energy Laboratory. Here he worked on a programme of intense theoretical research to better understand the magnetic and electrical properties of atomic nuclei. In 1934, he became the first director of the Radiophysics Laboratory, a relatively new division of the University of Cambridge, before joining the faculty in 1940. After serving in the army during the Second World War, he returned to academia, moving to the Department of Physics and Mathematics at the University of London in 1946, and acting as director from 1957 to 1965, when he became professor emeritus. In 1958, he served as President of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences, elected on 15 June 1958.  
 The main argument in his book `` The Magnetic Properties of Protons '' outlined his understanding that, rather than being defined as the elementary particles of matter, protons and deuterons were in fact elementary particles. In 1947 he introduced the concept of the Strong and Weak interaction, in which these elementary particles were grouped into the basic particles, and corresponded with the basic positrons and eutrons, called `` sodyne and terahertz ''.In 1950, he developed the concept of scalar energy density.

Robert Axelrod ( 26 January 1845 – 6 August 1924 ) was a British government official.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Axelrod was born in London on 26 January 1845, the eldest son of Samuel Axelrod, 3rd Baronet, a banker.  
 He graduated from the London School of Economics in 1881 with an MA, under Isaac Newton and in 1893 with an LL.D. He also studied economics at the University of Berlin under Ferdinand von Mueller. At the end of 1898, Axelrod was elected to the Society of Economic Advisors ( SED ). He resigned from the committee in 1904 but returned to the SED in 1905. His reputation at that time was almost as great as that of von Mueller, and Axelrod was also chosen President of the British Association of Technical Engineers in 1907 and President of the London Society of Chemistry in 1913. He was a member of the Institutional Services Committee of the Ministry of Supply and He Ltd., and was Secretary of the Control Committee of the Third Industrial Conference in London in 1911.In 1906, Axelrod, F. H. Holley, and N. C. Sheldon established the International Statistical Institute ( ISI ) in Stockholm, after American scientist Alexander Gibson Caldwell, and in 1914 it was transferred to the West German Federal Republic ( West Germany ). The institute is a source of research and for its members Canada, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the USA and Russia.In 1936, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Axelrod died in London on 6 August 1924.

 = Eugen Hamann =  
Eugen Martin Hamann ( 9 October 1908 in Verona – 25 October 1995 ) was a Dutch mathematician.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Verona to an ethnic German family of Protestant church. He graduated from a Dutch high school in the late 1940s.  
 From 1955 to 1966, he worked at the University of Lille, where he graduated with a doctorate in 1957. In 1968 he received the Third and Fourth Christian Theological Primes from the Academy of Sciences in Leiden. From 1966 to 1968, he worked for the Belgian AMVATG under the direction of Michel Flügge at the university of Leuven.  
 In 1970, he was an active member of the Dutch Central Committee for Political Economy.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 When general equilibrium theory became a mainstream concept, Hamann's approach shifted focus from determining the last mean deviation, and more to determining the distribution of responses to varying business or economic conditions, and his first priority, was the economic effects of business cycles. The studies of thermodynamics to determine the critical role of time series were debated ; now, with stochastic economics, one may hypothesize that a time series can be categorized into `` "normal time '' and `` time series '', with the `` regular time '' characterized by higher predictability and equilibrium, while a time series characterized by random fluctuations can be characterized by higher predictive ability and high variability. In 1974, he and Felix Unger coined the term normal temporal dynamics ( NMT ), to describe the variability found within the NMT distribution when the forecasts presented by individuals, the life-cycle-runoff rules, or human resources, and the dynamic uncertainty principle are combined.

According to Yevgeny Fedorov : `` Some years before, he had been engaged by the superintendent of this school, Mr. M. Vavilov, to introduce to the Russian Hebrew community an ambitious project for obtaining a high level of competence in the theoretical work of the Russian Jewish population. '' `` Fearing a ban of the educational and scientific literature by the government of the Russian Empire, Ivan Pavlov chose not to take up the program. `` After serving several stints in an engineer ’ s office in Samara, under the supervision of Joseph Prof. Ethelberger ( 1871-1921 ) he became a professor at the Physical University of Leningrad ( then a faculty of anatomy, and later department of physiology ). He was instrumental in the reestablishment of the Lenin Institute of Physiology and Physiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Leningrad ( 1953 ), where he remained until his retirement in 1962. His most notable students were Anatoly C3 A0minov and M. G. Bogatyrsky.  
 Pavlov worked extensively on field theory and the chemical basis of shock resistance. He and fellow pathologist Josef Basaglia conducted research on oxygen in the retina.

 = Ren C5 82evi C5 84tw C5 84 =  
Renđević Tdušović ( 6 December 1928 in Jadlava – 12 February 2004 ) was a Croatian economist and a conservative philosopher. He is the author of the economic and political system called Socialist Unity or The Essence of Democracy, a critique of left-wing politics. According to Dori Zernicka, a professor at the London School of Economics, the book has an impact as it does not meet with much reception because it does not criticize mainstream economics ; nevertheless, because of its influence, the political and social implications of its vision of the future were elaborated by many prominent liberals such as Winston Churchill, Josip Broz Tito, Leon Trotsky, James Mill,, Jürgen Habermas, Joan Robinson, Elizabeth Fitch, Joachim Fischer, Rudolf Rocker, Alexander Goedel, Sir Max Kropotkin, Jean-Paul Sartre and Adolphe Massieu.  
 Renđević was a Marxist and among his mentors was Rudolf Fichte. A Marxist who was ideologically aligned with the New Left, he was one of the founders of Zizek's anti-theory movement and a critic of Nazism. In 1919 he made a common demand for an economic reform that would transform Yugoslavia from an autocracy to a state-controlled economy with a market economy. It has been argued that the economics of Renđević made him influential in some of the more radical groups of early twentieth-century left-wing Europe.  
 Renđević was a leading voice in the education and research of Slovenian political economist and communist Karl Klimentsov. He believed that education in the schools should be free of political indoctrination. He was an active part of the Yugoslav World Front, and was present at the invasion of Austria, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Abkhazia in the summer of 1945.  
 Renđević was a native of Stanko, Hricnik county, Yugoslavia. He received his Habilitation from the Slovenian state university in Yugoslavia. He then went to Zagreb and was awarded a PhD from the Slovenian University of Sciences ( KsiLod ) in Zagreb. In 1948 he moved to Strasbourg, in 1958 he joined the faculty of the University of Brussels where he became professor emeritus in 1960. In 1982, he returned to the university of St. Gallen.  
   
   
 == Political views ==  
 Renđević is thought to have been influenced by such diverse figures as Jacobin Samuel de Wolff, Károly Stošča, Immanuel Kant, Ludwig von Mises, Oscar Pareto, Benjamin Tucker, Karl Marx, and Leopold Kruse. He also studied the writings of the classical economist Niccolò Machiavelli. In reaction to the war in Yugoslavia, Renđević drafted an opposition to the war. He believed that a victory was possible only through a `` democratic dictatorship '' that would be based on national autonomy and strong states.

Mikhail Aleksandrovich Mezhizhnikov ( Ukrainian : Алекса́ндр Лейхимович Наси́мов ; 19 January 1871 – 18 February 1954 ) was a Ukrainian composer, music theorist, music educator, and editor. He died of lung cancer at the age of 82 in Selly Oak, Georgia in 1954.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Mikhail Mikhail Mezhizhnikov was born on 19 January 1871 in the Russian Selly Oak village of Kutais, Transcaucasia, Russian Empire, now in Ukraine. He attended the Kutais Opera and Chamber Music School and, during the 1902–1906 holidays, pursued music studies in Moscow with L. A. Markov. In 1909 he won the participation in the competition held in Moscow to represent the Vasily Novikov-lucina concertos by recording them in the Akademiy Pravda.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was introduced to the Russian musical movement during the First World War by his uncle L. A. Markov. From 1924 to 1927 he taught at the Moscow Conservatory. In 1928, he became assistant director at the Conservatory. He published the quarterly `` Musici ergo '' under the pen-name of Peter Mcparash. In 1929 he began work on a new textbook of his own titled `` Arrangementos orthogonalis and orthogonoposias in tretes '' under the pseudonym of Hermann Waldgerd. In 1930, he was named professor of pedagogy at Moscow Conservatory. His students included Haydn Herzen, Szymon Tonon, Victor Lazarev, and Andrei Zverev. As a composer, Mezhizhnikov focused on instrumentalism. The subject of his compositions was equal parts varied, however, and the focus was often to preserve the traditions of the Armenian folk music.  
 Mezhizhnikov's interpretation of the ancient Russian folk music was that of Soviet folk music. The music is strongly influenced by early Russian dance music. His major pupil in the early 20th century was Konstantin Tsevko, a student of his in Moscow. Tsevko expressed, through his work, Mezhizhnikov's desire to honor the spirituality and musical integrity of these traditions.  
   
   
 === Mezhizhnikov's Theory of Intonation ===  
 Mezhizhnikov developed, to a remarkable extent, an idea that influenced the music theory of Ukrainian composers in the 1930s and 1940s, namely that of intonation. He taught that intonation refers to the harmonic qualities of a musical piece relative to the pitch of its original instrument, most especially the pitch at which the intonation first appears in the piece.Mezhizhnikov considered intonation to be a function of distance. The more distant, the larger the musical consonants in the string and the lower pitch of the vibrato. More distant consonants are more difficult to vocalize. The correct intonation for a piece of music is then a function of the distance from the original instrument to the upper or the middle register.  
 Based on the equal measure rule, the formula he developed for determining intonation, now known as the Mezhizhnikov formula, states :

 = John F. Donatello =  
John Francis Donatello ( August 12, 1910 – January 17, 1995 ) was an American economist and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from Texas. He was a strong supporter of student loans, particularly for Ph.D. students, and was active in congressional oversight of higher education. He is considered a founder of the multi-party system of government.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 He was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to John Donatello and Erlis McClintock ( née Klein ). He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1938 from Iowa State University, earning a Master of Science degree in economics from Stanford University in 1943. He later earned a Ph.D. from Iowa State University. Donatello served in the US Navy, where he was a lieutenant commander in the Pacific during World War II, where he was caught up in the Pacific Campaign in San Francisco Bay. In 1943, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. He returned to Iowa State University to earn his Ph.D. in economics.  
 He returned to the United States to become the assistant director of economic analysis for the Under Secretary of the Navy's Bureau of Ships from 1952 to 1954. This post provided him with the opportunity to work closely with the then Secretary of State James A. Garfield on Navy policy issues, and it gave him the opportunity to compare wartime military strategy with wartime economic policies. He worked as a political adviser to Republican Congressmen of the era, and later served as the first Chief Economic Advisor to President Gerald Ford. Donatello's memoirs Are You Happy Here? became one of the most influential books of the 20th century, and was published in 1998.  
 In 1955, Donatello accepted a position as director of the Russell Sage Foundation, an institution funded by the American Research and Development Administration ( ARDA ), one of the federal agencies charged with scientific research. ARDA spent $ 500,000 a year on research and development at the time, and Donatello was tasked with supporting the project's administrative, technical, and fundraising priorities. He remained with the project until 1976.  
 After serving as a senior adviser to President Jimmy Carter, Donatello joined President George H. W. Bush's administration as assistant secretary of labor. During this time, he shifted gears and directed the Office of Personnel Management. He was the first director of the Office of Personnel Management and he remained there until 1986.  
   
   
 == Educational legacy ==  
 Donatello was instrumental in creating the federal Student Loan Forgiveness Program. The first installment, which funded students from 1982 to 1986, was the largest of its kind. Donatello founded and served on the federal commission on student loans that negotiated the President's 1980 plan to eliminate student loan interest rates. After the program was established, he spent the next several years developing the Financial Aid Compensation System ( FSA CS ) and working to expand the possibility of assisting students with loans. The president, in 1980, introduced the first federal student loan guarantee program as the Priede Permanente Plan. In 1990, he joined the board of trustees of the American Association of University Women, which he chaired until 2001.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 John F. Donatello died on January 17, 1995, at the age of 84 in Dallas, Texas, from prostate cancer. He was survived by his daughter Anne, his granddaughter Susan, and his three grandchildren. He was survived by his wife of more than a half-century, Ann Martin-Donatello.

 = Theodor Z C3 BCllendorf =  
Theodor Zöllendorf ( 28 September 1814, Kirch-Buch – 23 January 1882, Berlin ) was a German philosopher and professor of theology at the University of Berlin. His mother Elisabeth published him a biography and his brother Ferdinand was his son-in-law. He wrote an account of the chief beliefs of the ancient Catholic Church and served as Bishop of Trier.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Zöllendorf was born in Trier, Germany. In the year 1820, as the middle of the Civil War, he joined the University of Heidelberg. The first few years were extremely hard for him, especially as he was forced to miss his seminary classes and forges, while he struggled with debilitating case of tuberculosis. At the end of the war, however, he was able to obtain a liberal education in the University of Göttingen. He then went to Freiburg, and at the request of his uncle, the Archbishop of Freiburg, he received a public benefice of € 5,000 for three years, which enabled him to learn various languages.  
 In 1842, he became a professor of theology at the University of Berlin, but not the University of Freiburg. That university was located in the under-developed region of the German frontier, and so it had little scope for such a person. In the event, at the instigation of a friend ( whose name was not disclosed ), Zöllendorf obtained a medical doctorate from the University of Freiburg for 17 and a half years, and he entered upon a literary and other preoccupations.  
 During this period, he also devoted himself to the study of Catholicism in his school ( `` Des Herrnfassungs-Verbreitungschule '' ) of the University of Berlin. He was, however, an atheist, who, despite his training, could never understand the philosophy and the nature of Christianity. In 1846, after having long suspected the cause, he gave up all religious discussion. With the creation of the Protestant theologian Friedrich von Ruitzel, he resolved to profess another religion : with Ruitzel he took the thesis of the necessity of distinction, in which he fully rejected the belief in the equal unity of all things, and in which he explicitly and especially refuted the theory of God. In 1849, he formed a religious union with the Protestant preacher Ernst Müller, and became an honorary member of the `` Christus Arbeitenbarkeit '' ( movement for the strengthening of Christian morality ) at Berlin. During his many travels in the speaking countries he visited Persia and Mongolia.  
 In 1859 he was elected to a sub-ratio of membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Here he founded and conducted for twenty years the theological seminary. There he wrote almost four hundred sermons, which formed the basis of all later works of theologians such as Bernd Fränkel ( 1833–1882 ), Heinrich Hildebrandt ( 1833–1885 ), Johann Gottlieb Westermann ( 1833–1886 ), Julius Herrmann ( 1847–1927 ) and Robert Schwalbach ( 1867–1923 ).  
   
 In Berlin, and at St. Michael's church in Silesia, he wrote a voluminous, never-published autobiography, `` Professor Zöllendorf. `` In 1863 he gave his last lectures in Berlin, in the presence of the ministers of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the St. Peter's chapel.  
 He died in Berlin on 23 January 1882, having been 82 years of age.

 = David Porter Jordan =  
David Porter Jordan ( January 18, 1929 – August 15, 1998 ) was a theoretical physicist who taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1961 until his death in 1998, having taken the University's classical-theoretical physics major under the direction of Ray Lankester.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 David Porter Jordan was born in Hinsdale, Massachusetts on January 18, 1929, the eldest of four sons of the lawyer and businessman Stanley Jordan and Rachel Mandelein Jordan. Jordan's family was originally from the Limerick family, who settled in Massachusetts and later lived in Long Beach, California. At the age of fourteen, Jordan began studying electricity under the supervision of Fred Thomas. Jordan first completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1940 under Ray Lankester, and a Master of Science degree in Physics under Thomas in 1945 under the direction of Ernest Lawrence. Jordan completed his Ph.D. in 1950 under Lawrence, and returned to the Johns Hopkins faculty in 1951 under Lankester, continuing to work with Lawrence's collaboration with Ernest Lawrence. Jordan was awarded an honorary doctorate from New York University in 1952. During the 1950s, Jordan was a noted faculty member and Reader in Experimental Physics. During his seven years at Johns Hopkins, Jordan remained an active member of the mathematical and experimental physics department, and was known as `` a respected teacher ''. Jordan was the Dean of the Mathematics Department in 1962 and retired in 1984. In 1984, the American Mathematical Society awarded Jordan the Ray Lankester Memorial Prize, in recognition of his `` significant contributions to mathematics '' in his 30 years of teaching and teaching programs. Jordan was also a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. He died on August 15, 1998, in Johns Hopkins Hospital, of a heart attack, from complications related to kidney disease.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 Jordan entered the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins in 1961. He was awarded a baccalaureate in 1967, and PhD in 1970 under Ray Lankester. He joined the Laboratory of Computational Optics under Ernest Lawrence in the same year, and the Laboratory of Physics under James Hammer in 1971. During this time, he was Associate Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy, and served as a visiting professor. Jordan's seminar work was not always fruitful for the subject matter, however, particularly in the mathematical physics department. Jordan's major work that bears his name concerned the development of the Lankester–Dahler theory. During Jordan's time as professor, the mathematical physics department at Johns Hopkins ( known as the Delmonico–Jordan Complex ) became the center for research in structural physics, specifically nuclear physics. Jordan would later leave the group because he found a primary concern to be the continuation of Lawrence's work.  
 Jordan's graduate student contribution in the mathematical physics department was Donald Beisstein, who became one of the best-known and most influential theoretical physicists of the 1960s and 1970s. Beisstein would go on to be the Director of the Joint Center for Computational Physics at the MIT.  
 Jordan served as Assistant Professor in both Mathematics and Astronomy until 1971. He returned to the Computer Science Department in 1971, and became the first full-time teaching physicist at Johns Hopkins. Jordan held the chair of the Mathematics Department until his retirement in 1988.  
 Jordan moved from Johns Hopkins to the Institute for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1990 and taught there until his retirement in 1996, completing a dissertation in the area of finite element models of decision problems.  
 Jordan's work was cited in a 1976 article in the `` Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences '' by Lankester, which highlighted Jordan's contribution to the development of computational physics. Lankester, who was known for his creative philosophy as a teacher, often said that Jordan's philosophy was akin to Newton's, and the two men were on the same page.  
 The role of the Institute for Advanced Study in computational physics is primarily to stimulate research and development of techniques that will improve our understanding of the physics of systems and forces.  
 Jordan was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Mathematical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Jordan authored or co-authored more than 150 scientific papers and authored a book on statistical physics.

 == Background ==  
 Neij was born in Helsinki, Finland in 1938. He had two brothers and two sisters, and grew up in Marti in Jussu, Finland, and Hultin in Kjos, Sweden. He studied from 1960 to 1965 at the University of Helsinki, where he also had a summer scholarship. During his stay at the university, he met his future wife, Tamara Michalij, a music teacher. Together they started a family and had three daughters. They worked as art historians at the central Helsinki University ( 1968–70, 1971–73 ) and as professors at Aalborg University ( 1973–75 ) and the Center for International Law in Helsinki ( 1975–76 ). In 1977, he became foreign minister.  
   
   
 == President of European Council and of the Council of the Nordic Councils ==  
 On May 7, 1989, Neij was elected to the European Council and the Council of the Nordic Councils.

 Susan Esslemont was born in Stockholm on 2 October 1913. She attended the gymnasium in Stockholm. At the age of ten, she enrolled in a private school for girls in Uppsala and in the same year she went on a school journey with her father ( a teacher ), Anton Sandin, and a friend. At the end of the school year, they had reached Urmia, a village in the Norwegian Northern Provinces, where he found the girls and pregnant and had the babies moved to the Women's Home for the Infirm.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1933, Esslemont travelled to the United States to study medical psychology at Columbia University in New York City. She enrolled at the University of Chicago and graduated in 1937. She became the first Swedish female to earn a degree in the United States ( she was a student there in the 1930s ). She was appointed first principal of Fjeldskapitalet in 1936 and in 1938 obtained her doctorate ( with a dissertation on the hygiene of pre-school children ). Esslemont performed some of the first research to study the effects of hygiene on women in Sweden in the United States.  
 In 1938 she started working as a psychiatrist at the Bellevue Hospital in New York City and continued to work at Bellevue until 1962, during which time she began to work on the first collaboration with Åke Ullerstam-Nygaard. A major achievement was her co-design of a new general health questionnaire ( data were collected between 1950 and 1954 ), the age–sex categories and sexual behaviour questionnaires, and she coined the term `` facilitation '' to refer to learning methods that guided research. In 1944, she made a joint study with Christina Mogróska-Sälling ( the first woman to do so ) of the effects of music therapy and is credited with designing the study rooms in the ward of young children in Bellevue, where teachers were taught to create an atmosphere conducive to learning.  
 When the parents of two young children, Albert Stanley ( who was a `` model kid '' with excellent verbal skills ) and Ato Lynn, entered on the same teaching career, their friends suggested that they should follow their mother on a study tour to United States children's homes. They left the Washington, D.C. area and took a bus for six days from New York City to Palo Alto, California, to visit the Aspen Festival. The bus journey, in the company of 13 American health professionals and an international team of doctors, took them to the children's home of the future president of the United States, Harry S. Truman, where they did research on pianism and mathematics.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Susan Esslemont married John Hedin, a father of the philosopher Michael Medved, in 1948. She never remarried and their marriage lasted 20 years. In 1991, her father became an American citizen and for many years died in San Francisco at the age of 90.  
 Susan Esslemont died of a brain haemorrhage in Wexford, Italy on 16 February 2006, aged 84.

 = J. D. Franklin =  
James D. Franklin ( 18 January 1898 – 27 February 1985 ) was an American biologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 James D. Franklin was born in Florida and grew up in Albany, Massachusetts, where he met his future wife, Margaret ( née Hill ), a general practitioner. They went on to have four children. They were educated at Sacred Heart College and graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1937. Franklin trained as a zoologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School before moving to California in 1941. He wrote the seminal textbook The Biological and Social Life of Animals, and served as director of the school's Department of Biological Sciences. In 1954 he founded the Institute of Zoology at the California Institute of Technology. The institute's biological laboratory provided facilities for experimenters, and Franklin also was the first president of the Society for Comparative Anatomy and Comparative Physiology. Franklin was a director of the California Institute of Technology until his death. He died on 27 February 1985, in Pasadena, California.  
 Franklin's work was relevant for the transition from pre-Darwinian biology to modern biological systems, the holomarche. He introduced the concept of emergent biology to the field of embryology.  
 Franklin married Margaret Hill, the daughter of a Boston lawyer. They had two children. In 1950 they went on to have five children. The Franklin children live in Berkeley, California. Margaret founded the Society for Comparative Anatomy and Comparative Physiology in 1954. In 1966 she was inducted into the American Zoological Hall of Fame.  
 Franklin is commemorated in the scientific names of several animals :  
 Franklin was the first person to name a new species of freshwater fish, Cephalotoma niger, in the journal Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  
 The marine organism ( Boma species ) Franklinidae was named for him.  
 Franklin's early research on viruses focused on herpes simplex virus and herpes simplex sarcoma. However, Franklin's experiments with the bacterium Salmonella heirogluvirus led him to discover the diphtheria toxin lysozyme.In the 1980s, Franklin published a work with Suzanne Albertson-Brandeis, Elizabeth Johnstone and others entitled Human speciation in Africa, which summarised what had happened in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, East Africa and the Sahara, and delineated the `` geologic arc '' of human migration from Africa to the Americas. Franklin also contributed to the list of 26 names of vertebrates that are etymologically related to humans, and the existence of the genus Franklinius.  
 Franklin's 1972 book Society and Theory of Evolution, or, How Man Created Man, attracted a great deal of attention and debate. The book's characterisation of the `` leviathan '' philosophy of evolution, i.e. the concept that humans have fixed, biological traits ( such as those described in fossils ) and that the evolutionary theory of Lamarck was able to explain them, was met with intense criticism by those who thought evolution was'still unproven '.  
 Franklin has been described as `` the final brain trust of Least Energy '' ( Geoffrey Quine ), and underwrote two of the three research programmes of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The anthropologist Robert Kroeber was also a longtime Franklin supporter.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 In 1948, Franklin married Margaret Hill, the sister of Columbia University political scientist Jerome B. Hill. They had two children : Bob Franklin ( 1960-1987 ) and Lois Hill ( 1963-1989 ). John Horner, of Egleston, Massachusetts, recalled that `` 'He taught [ her ] to be a scientist,'said Glenn A. Clarkson, `` and then he was probably the most accurate, courteous man in the world.''' Franklin's wife Margaret died in 1992.  
 Franklin married Rebecca Marder Whitney ( née Hagen ) in 1947 and had four children. He died in 1990, aged 64.

Heinrich Buchhorn ( September 10, 1831 – August 28, 1887 ) was an Austrian-born British physicist, professor of mechanics at the University of Glasgow, and an important member of the work group responsible for the celebrated Bell-Bulletin conference, at which the structure of the atom and of other fundamental particles was determined.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Altstadt in Livonia, the son of a cloth manufacturer. In 1856 he completed secondary school in Livonia, then studied at the University of Breslau, where he obtained the cand.electrical lyc. degree. In 1870 he became a lecturer in physics at the University of Breslau. He then became professor of physics and astronomy in 1873, in the same year taking charge of the department of physics. Buchhorn's interest in mathematical theory attracted him to the work of John von Neumann.  
 In 1873, with von Neumann as a fellow, he founded the institute for theoretical and experimental physics at Glasgow. In 1882, during the First World War, Buchhorn served in a mission to Chile under the Provisional Government of the Belgian Congo ( Pro-Tem ).  
 Buchhorn left in 1884 for England. In 1905 he succeeded to his professorship at Cambridge, but in 1882 he was promoted to the position of professor of mechanics. In 1898 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1901 he founded the Glasgow Institute for the Study of Electricity, followed by an academic exhibition in 1902 and a lecture series in 1907–08. His collections, catalogues and other documents of various branches of the civil service, are now held by the Archives of the Scottish Department of the Royal Society.  
 From 1914–15 he was a member of the editorial boards of magazines such as Monthly Review and British Journal of Science. Buchhorn was also an author.  
 He died in Glasgow on August 28, 1887.  
   
   
 == Notable students ==  
 Otto Seeger was a lifelong friend. Seeger became an early supporter of atomic and molecular physics and in 1881 asked Buchhorn to give him a course on boron and manganese chemistry, through which he obtained a B.Sc. degree. He became professor of chemistry at Cambridge in 1885.  
 Helmut Kohl was a graduate student of John Buchhorn and, at Buchhorn's encouragement, a student at Hamburg. In 1905 Kohl received an M.Sc. degree from Cambridge.

 == Biography ==  
 Percival was born at Abadea in Sinaloa. He attended the Jesuit seminary of Quirigues, where he studied geology and sociology. Later he became a cardinal. He became the district chaplain of Azuay, capital of Perú province. In 1894 he became Vicar General of Quirigues, a post which he held until his death.  
 In 1900, Percival was elected a member of the Spanish Legislative Assembly for the province of Quirigues.  
 On 25 October 1913 he became one of the founding members of the central government of the Ecuadorian republic ( OAS ), and a member of the founding congress of the socialist student movement ( PSUC ) in the city of Quirigues ( of which he was first deputy president and in which he served as the editor ). He represented that province from 1911 to 1914 and in 1917 from 1918 to 1918 as well as from 1918 to 1918.  
 Percival died on 23 May 1927, the year of the state anniversary of the Imperial Spanish Republic ( SIFR ). He was a leading voice in the third national government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ).  
   
   
 == Writings ==  
 Percival's work largely focused on sociology and political economy and provided an intellectual and intellectual bridge for the later Argentine Revolution. He was the first to identify the emergence of a socialist society in Ecuador and during the next fifteen years, Percival and his fellow Jesuit Alejandro Laguna began working out the ideas of an economic socialist society.  
 He had a strong interest in public education as well as economic economics, and was also a political economist. In his inaugural address in Quirigues in 1897, Percival made the following statement :  
   
 From the perspective of social action, the spiritualists point out that there are two modes of economic activity. The first—the side of production which makes things, and uses them for human welfare—is for the specific class of the individual. The second—the side of production in which individuals rest their lives on the fruits of production, and produces goods to make themselves better off—in short, the economic self-realization of the individual—has to do with the social action of the multitude, as in the value-creators. At the present time, both methods—both ultimately universal and without controversy—have come to be referred to as the system of market relations, or what Algernon Sidney calls the universal social order. This order consists of a system of money for all the people, an order of production which has all of the characteristics of a universal social community—social intercourse for the individual, and of mutual assistance between individuals, so that in total the burden of production, what social intercourse is but a mere station to be removed, can now be divided among each individual.  
 Percival had a great influence in the late 20th century, with his doctoral student Lina Huber translating the works of Peirats. He was also involved in political economy during the time of Juan Perón and in the early part of the 1960s.

 = Aubrey E. Bala =  
Aubrey Edward Bala ( 1915–1996 ) was an American nuclear physicist and particle physicist. He was most known for his pioneering and influential work on cross-band magnetism in semiconductors. His influential ideas remain relevant to a large number of applications.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Aubrey Edward Bala was born in Philadelphia on August 25, 1915. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1927, and was a Fulbright scholar in the USA from 1932 to 1937. He then joined the Physics Department at the University of California, Berkeley in 1937 as Assistant Professor of Physics.  
   
   
 == Professional career ==  
 In the US, Bala took part in the United States Navy's development of radar, and joined the Los Alamos Laboratory as the Deputy Director in 1944. He then worked with the US Naval Research Laboratory on radar for many years, and in the 1950s became the laboratory's Associate Director, an important post for scientists.In the 1960s, Bala became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He remained in that position until 1982, and, in his final years, he directed the Institute for Optics, Optics and Quantum Theory at the University. He died in Berkeley, California, in 1996, and is buried in the UC Berkeley Aviation and Air Force Heritage Center, a quiet residential neighborhood.  
   
   
 == Life and legacy ==  
   
   
 === Critical work ===  
   
 Bala's fundamental research in theory and application of semiconductor cross-band magnetic momenta began in a paper, `` Electron Discharge with the Stereochronous Transistor '', which he presented to the American Physical Society in 1930. The paper, with colleagues J. B. A. Randall and R. E. Shackelford, anticipated later work by researchers such as Robert Stoup and Ernest Lindemann, establishing that the magnetic momenta of a semiconductor could be measured using time and distance variations of the electron path.  
 The early contributions of Aubrey E. Bala laid the groundwork for widely adopted cross-band magnetic momenta measurements, and a new field of research—electronic spectroscopy.  
   
   
 === Nobel Prize in physics ===  
   
 The University of California awarded Bala the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1962 for the discovery of the Wicker equation, which described the magnetisation of semiconductor surfaces by magnetic moments. The Nobel Laureate wrote, `` If you read the paper on its own, you will not find anything resembling a name. But remember, in the long term, it will have great significance to particle physics. '' The Nobel Prize was first presented on May 27, 1964, by Nobel laureate Arno Penzias.

Jacques Benoist ( 24 June 1852 – 1 August 1924 ) was a French pianist and composer, noted for his violin work, an early electronic keyboard.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
 Benoist was born in Paris. At the age of seven, he entered the Paris Conservatoire where he excelled in piano playing, clarinet playing, horn playing and saxophone playing. During his stay at the Conservatoire, he met violinist Cécile Pechman. When the young pianist quit his post in 1888 to return to school, Benoist was determined to emulate his pupil by studying on his own. The day after his 11th birthday, Benoist attended his first music class.  
 In 1889, he won first prize in the second national competition of the Conservatoire de Paris and, at age 17, was elected its professor. Benoist became professor of harmony and composition at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1892 and in 1894 appointed him its rector and conservator. In 1893 he made his début with a concerto for viola, timpani and piano.  
 In 1895 Benoist also became first viola master of the Paris Opera. He remained there until 1899, and also conserved for the 1912-14 season at the Grand Palais, in Paris.  
 The success of the new choral works inspired Benoist to undertake works for solo and choral concerts, and in 1897 he returned to the Paris Conservatoire where he directed its violin department. He also became the Conservator for clarinet.In 1902 Benoist was appointed to the chair of string trio. In 1904 he published the work Op. 18, with its Trio, Nocturne, and Fugue. It is a symphony-like movement that begins with the melody of The Star Spangled Banner, marches on to scenes of the French Revolution, before culminating with a patriotic duet. As with the other works of this series, Op. 18 is based on some classical pieces, and contained a book-length score, the so-called `` Piguet ''.  
 In 1910 Benoist served as the acting president of the Société Royale d'Orléans, becoming President to the end of the war. In 1913 he was named one of the 100 most influential composers of the 20th century by the French Academy of Arts.  
 Benoist died in Paris and was buried at Lourdes cemetery.

Bernhard Conrad Liebenstein ( 1 November 1846 – 12 July 1933 ) was a German Protestant theologian and Lutheran professor of Theology and Missionary Work. He was a leading political figure in the German Lutheran Church. He is regarded as the father of Lutheran Reform. He was ordained in 1877 and was rector of Kapp Cottarett in Silesia until 1899. He was made an Honorary Doctor of Theology in 1902 and was the first Director of the Main Wald- und Konstanz Evangelischer Mission in 1894, after which he served as preacher and general secretary until 1911, when he succeeded to the pastoral chair.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Liebenstein was born in Hamburg to Roman-Lutheran parents ; his father was a founder of the Protestant Church. He studied theology at Hamburg and Strasbourg, graduating with a doctorate in 1876. In 1878, he was ordained to the priesthood as a lay priest, and, two years later, served as one of the first theological professors of the town of Kappackstanz, South Württemberg. In 1883 he was appointed minister at Abshan-Schlotenshausen, South Tyrol, while preparing for the ministry at Kappackstanz and working for one year as professor of Old Testament and New Testament. In 1885, after reforming the theological curriculum of the parish school in Kappackstanz and reorganizing the Missionary Society, he was elected pastor of Kappackstanz. He was named lecturer in theology at the Main Wald- und Konstanz Evangelischer Mission and professor of Theology and Missionary Work at the Christian Hospital for Sick Children ( founded in 1900 ), founded by Henry Owen in 1882. When W. A. Kantor replaced Dietrich Bernhard Siegert as pastor of Abshan-Schlotenshausen, the Seventh-day Adventist congregation there protested, and the movement led to Kantor's resignation. Liebenstein was a co-founder of the National Academy of Protestant Theology.  
 Liebenstein is noted for the Revised Revised Theology of the New Testament and for the German translations of the Epistles of St Paul and St John and the Epistles of Paul and St Paul, to which he added many new translations. He also edited an edition of the Acts of the Apostles, and a translation of the New Testament Revelation was presented to the Imperial House of Russia.

 == Biography ==  
 Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Gertrude Seawald earned her M.S. and M.D. degrees at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. After studying in France, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom, Seawald published her first paper in 1903.  
 Seawald joined the University of Chicago as an assistant in 1905 and graduated in 1908. She spent many years as an assistant and instructor at the University of Chicago Medical School. Seawald also worked as a laboratory technician for the Mental Hygiene Service of the Children's Bureau.  
 Seawald and her husband G. H. Seawald conducted numerous research studies on the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as leucosarcoma, which worsened in the womb and was much more frequent in African-American girls than white girls. This study was critical in inspiring the creation of treatment guidelines for this devastating disease. The name `` Seawald's Disease '' was created for Seawald after her work. Seawald was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology in 1934. Her papers have been cited more than 8,500 times.Seawald married G.H. Seawald in 1902. They had a daughter, Mrs. Alicia ( seawald-ah ) Seawald, and a son, G. Robert Seawald, born in the same year, who also made many important contributions to neurology.  
 Seawald received many honors. She was made a foreign citizen in 1923.She died in Washington, D.C.. In 1992, the G. Robert Seawald Award from the OCLC was established by the National Child Neurology Foundation in her memory.

 = James Laycock, 2nd Baron Laycock =  
Sir James Laycock ( 13 March 1809 – 18 March 1892 ) was a British politician, civil servant and biographer who served as the House of Commons Speaker between 1877 and 1882.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Laycock was born in St John's Hall, London, to John Laycock, an industrialist who became Mayor of Bath, and his wife, Mary Haydon, daughter of John Haydon and Sir James Minnie. His father, Sir J. Laycock, was in the course of advocating the establishment of schools, and in 1839, having secured from Bishop Ferdinand Day his support for that purpose, laid the foundation of a new Independent Cathedral School, a gift from the first Lord of St John. Laycock was educated at the Cornhill School, Basingstoke, and at The Royal Military College, Woolwich.He joined the Conservatives, but not until 1864 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was so influential that Lord Rennard became aware of the sudden change of his position. At a private dinner in 1867 he co-sponsored an article entitled `` The Government's War '', of which, as a member, he was also a member of the Royal Society. In 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and of the Economic Association of Great Britain. He then served as a Government advisor until 1881, when he was forced out of office by the changes of 1881. The Year of the Sheep was his last official act.  
   
   
 == Social views ==  
 Laycock, along with his successor Lord Richards, was in favour of introducing a constitution that would extend the franchise to its essential features, without restricting it to male suffrage and education ; and a government or a parliament should be free to legislate as to civil, ecclesiastical and commercial matters. On the other hand, he was a `` Socialist '', and in 1864, as successor to Lord Lusby, he wrote the motion of the House of Lords which made it compulsory for the House of Commons to investigate issues relating to industrial production, a duty which was to be a privilege of Parliament.  
   
   
 == Politics ==  
 Laycock was for the Reconstruction of the Post-War Parliament after the Civil War. He regarded it as incumbent on him to introduce reforms in the war effort and to urge them in Parliament. He was at first enthusiastic about making improvements in the relations between the army and the navy, but at a conference of his Conservative colleagues, he sharply criticised them for their utter indifference to the services that the navy rendered to Britain, and particularly the navy's great contribution to the strength and capability of the air fleet. Nevertheless, his intervention in 1881 marked the end of his career.

Arthur Dalziel ( 6 November 1881 – 21 December 1949 ) was a British pianist and pedagogue. He was the son of doctor Francis Dalziel, and the grandson of Isaac Dalziel, an English church minister. He began his professional piano studies at the Royal College of Music in 1898, under the tutelage of Lloyd McIntyre.  
 After his graduation, Dalziel toured as a pupil of Henrik Ibsen, toured to Germany with the German Romantic Quartet, and won the 1911 Victoria Cross for the second year in a row. In 1913 he was appointed lecturer of music at the Royal College of Music, and a year later, lecturer of harmony at the Metropolitan College of Music in London. In 1916 he was appointed Master of Arts at the Imperial College of Music and Music Theory, under Charles Jacobs, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College in 1918. In 1924 he won the Dixa Schumann Prize, and in 1929, the Arnold Schoenberg Prize.On 1 January 1936, Dalziel was attacked and seriously injured in his house by a drunken schizophrenic and committed suicide on 21 December 1949, apparently by jumping from a window.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Dalziel is best known for composition of mixed orchestral works, such as Cantata for orchestra and Theme for choir, as well as playing in radio, TV and film music. His songs for piano, alongside soloist Igor Stravinsky and voice, have been recorded many times and are admired by many international composers. The latter's inclusion of several of Dalziel's songs, originally written for himself by Stravinsky, in the Selected Works for Piano ( Dixa Schumann Prize, 1923 ), made a great impression on Stravinsky, and led to a friendship.

 == Life ==  
 Deczynszky was born in the village of Walicki Teodonna ( present-day Udałość ) in the Przemysl Province. In 1880, at the age of 16, he entered at the Iron School, where he graduated in 1880 with an extraordinary merit. In 1883, he went to London, where he worked at the Tate Brothers'School.  
 On the recommendation of his friend and fellow student, Max Lemoine, in 1884 he won an English mining scholarship to enter the University of Edinburgh, where in 1889 he first studied mineralogy and physics, and also mathematics and English literature. In 1891, he won a fellowship in mineralogy from the Royal College of Mines in Glasgow. Deczynszky began his research on the mineral co-esphosphate, discovered in 1885. Deczynszky is the author of Deczynszky's Elements of Mineralogy ( 1894 ), which laid the foundation of hydrostatics, crystallography, and mineralogy in general.Deczynszky was a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Academy of Sciences of Warsaw, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

 = R C3 A9lob Fr C3 A9val =  
Rélob Fréval ( 8 December 1907 – 29 September 1999 ) was a French philosopher, physicist, mathematician, geneticist, paleontologist and cofounder of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, a leading centre for paleontology in France.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Liège, Fréval studied Physics at the Universities of Liège and Bordeaux, and became fascinated by the theory of special relativity and began to read modern physics more seriously. Following this interest, he decided to join the French government in 1952 as a science minister, serving as minister from 1962 to 1965. In 1966, the CNR appointed him director of the Natural History Museum, a position he would hold until 1988. As part of this work, he led the team that discovered spheroidal molluscs on the Southern Ocean and travelled to Australia and Canada, discovering the fossil footprints of Velociraptor.During the same period he was also an author and academic researcher, notable for working out the law of identity, the importance of alpha and beta decay, and the computation of periodicities. He published more than 100 papers and monographs. Fréval died of heart failure in 1998. He was survived by his wife of 43 years, Françoise – who later became a Nobel laureate.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Fréval's parents were Jean and Emile-Émile Fréval. Both of his parents were French-born. His paternal grandfather, Hermann, was a founding member of the French Republic and a founder of the Social Party in the late 19th century. Françoise's maternal grandfather, Alois Fréval, was the founder and first president of the Société d'extrême fatality, the society that advocated the treatment of lost limbs, including women's lost limbs.The family moved to London in 1923, where Françoise studied under William Thomson and built up a considerable amount of scientific knowledge.In 1924 he graduated with first class honours from the University of Liège. In 1926 he became a PhD student at the University of Bordeaux. His thesis concerned an area with high atmospheric pressure. This concerned the study of molecular droplets and he was awarded a PhD the following year. In 1930 he became a researcher at the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1936, he became the director of the natural history museum, which he would remain in for three decades. He became assistant director of the natural history museum in 1949, a post he held until his retirement in 1971. During this time he also published some 700 papers and monographs.  
 He became director of the Cavendish Laboratory in 1950, a post he would hold until 1988. Fréval was heavily involved in the study of the morphology of the vertebrate fossils that he discovered in the Southern Ocean. The southern mainland of North Africa – known as the Mauritius triangle, or the molluscs – had been described by French paleontologist Étienne Geoffroy-Le Pen in 1933. With Owen Burrell, John Overbeek, Brian Moore and Bernard Boévy, Fréval and Burrell mapped the fossils found in the region. In these papers they showed that they were of `` embryic origin '' – 'biologically isolated'from their mother's mollusks. Even the name of the group of marsupials that came to be known as Floresia, ( `` yellow-billed platypuses '' ), may have come from this discovery.  
 In 1957, Fréval and his colleagues analysed the jaw bones and teeth of three vertebrates – the Endegoliform sturgeon, the hemoglobinous ocean snail Sphenodon and the pachyderm scavenger Sceloporus, and concluded that they came from reptiles that had survived the last ice age. He also analyzed other mammals – including Homo habilis, the oldest known human –, and concluded that he was `` the only paleontologist to identify a group of Homo-Sciurusiens by regard to their tooth geometry and jaw morphology ''. The last time someone had confidently recognised the grouping was by Carolus Linnaeus, in 1885.

 In 1990 he was awarded the Prix de Rome. In 2004 he was awarded the Legion of Honour.

 = Hugo Grotz =  
Hugo Grotz ( German : [ hɛɛ ] ; 9 March 1891 – 24 November 1975 ) was a German-born American violinist and composer. He is most notable for the composition of the opera Gipsy Danger in tenor and piano.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hugo Grotz was born on 9 March 1891 in Munich to Anton Grotz, a retired baritone of the Teutonic Order, and Sophie Czemka. He studied violin at the Leipzig Conservatory and at the Berlin-based Max Vogel Conservatory where his father, also a violinist, worked under Paul Hindemith.  
 In 1909, Grotz was commissioned by the Russian Empire as a violinist for the Hetalia Opera in Saint Petersburg. He was the master cellist for the inaugural opera. He performed that premiere in a modified version of the Hungarian folk song style which was first performed in Istanbul in 1913. The opera was one of the first successes of G. Usserviz. As a violinist, Grotz composed and performed his own scores, especially the multi-movement Gipsy Danger ( 1927 ), performed at the 1936 World's Fair in Washington, DC. The score was originally composed for two pianos, but Grotz had to substitute these two instruments for the two traditional concert-game pianos to accommodate an increased audience size. His version of Gipsy Danger had some parallels with that of Chopin and Liszt, but was also distinctly unique in how he developed the music to the choral techniques of Mazurkas, Polka and Rachmaninoff. It is significant that Grotz was instrumental in writing the text for this work, which was written by Hermann Heyde and Ernst Gerhard Herzog and premiered by Wilhelm Stein ( conductor of the Bach and Rachmaninoff Hall orchestra, 1910–11 ).  
 In 1927, Grotz joined the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra ( now known as the Kreisau Circle ), a highly trained professional orchestra which also included Liszt, Chopin, Schumann, and Debussy. From 1927 to 1933 Grotz was a professor at the Juilliard School, but he never returned to teaching there. Grotz retired from the Prague Philharmonic in 1934. He married Rebecca Cohn ( 1889–1990 ) in 1933 and they had three children, Hector ( who would go on to become a noted classical pianist ), Hanna, and Patricia ( born 1955 ).In the late 1940s, Grotz turned to violin-making as a career and joined the Offenbach-La Mer for the large-scale work Nacht der Fliegende ( 1936 ). In the late 1950s and 1960s, he also composed works for organ and chamber music. Among his larger-scale works was the opera Circus Bleu ( 1960 ) in which he played an unnamed character in the role of the inimitable Madame Bovary. From 1955, Grotz also appeared on many radio programs promoting the work of Josef Kosminsky and other great Austrian composers.  
 Grotz served as a viola soloist in the cantata Les Musketeers du bassin et la guerre ( 1950 ) and the orchestral pieces Andante for piano ( 1961 ) and Le musique ( 1962 ). He also composed cello sonatas ( String Quartet ), which were largely for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and conducted Schubert and Liszt recitals. His choirsman has been noted as having a particular talent for arranging the minuets of Mozart. A book was published in 1968 called Lo professeur Grotz : his Art of Strings which details his day to day practice of orchestral playing. In 1971 he retired from the violin making profession. He also continued to write as a composer and was a staff member for the Minnesota Orchestra.  
 Grotz died in Minneapolis on 24 November 1975 at age 83.

Never forget how my colleagues working at the Faculté de Biologie reported back on that day in '98, on the discovery of the phosphatidylinositol 3,5-diamidino-4-hydroxypyrimidine ( phosphatidylinositol 4-O-acetate ) cell, described me as only the first to bring this discovery into view.  
.  
   
 == Research ==  
 Arrighi's research focused on the paragamete hormone receptor ( PIR ).  
 It is believed that the PIR influences action of gonadotropin, and has a direct effect on sexual development.  
 Arrighi is the first to show that circadian rhythms of adrenal secretion are important in the regulation of sexual differentiation.  
 In 1929, Arrighi published a study on the detection of psychotropic steroids produced in a sexually mature mouse when injected with an apocrine hormone.  
 He also studied the effects of sex hormones on the neuroendocrine system of human reproductive organs.

 == Biography ==  
 Louis Lalande was born in Montreuil and worked as a civil servant. He studied law at the Sorbonne. In the late 1830s and 1840s he was a lecturer of philosophy at the Sorbonne, and in 1843, as a legal chaplain of the Imperial Legion, he became director of a literary mission to Madagascar.  
 His literary missions came under the influence of a conviction of Mazarine Minot, who encouraged him to introduce a particular method of composing ethical poems which would express their characters in an `` enchanting graphic form ''.Louis Lalande died at the age of 69, while on a horse ride. The poor state of his health has been a source of difficulty in his biographies.Several of his writings are held by the Université Paul Eudes, and, despite their status as historical documents, he was sometimes accused of plagiarism. He was succeeded as President of the Pontifical Roman Catholic Church in 1873, after his death.

 = Ælle Harlandhund =  
Ælle Harlandhund ( November 12, 1897 – October 12, 1974 ) was a Danish geneticist and bacteriologist. In particular, he is known for his studies of the roots of typhus in both humans and nonhuman animals. Harlandhund is regarded as the father of modern research in the study of typhus.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Harlandhund was born in Copenhagen in 1897. In 1903 he began his studies at the University of Copenhagen at a time when textbooks concerning bacteriology were scarce. At the age of 23, he became the leader of a group of scientists who made a number of discoveries that were incorporated into the emerging field of microbiology in Copenhagen.  
 His research included the establishment of a typhoid susceptibility test on a castrated patient, discovering the origin of syphilis in mice, and the production of a type of rifless virus for test-producing mosquitoes. Later, he worked on breeding typhus virus in a carrier form into a rickettsial ( or virulence-forming ) vector organism. He produced and showed that the paralytic form, typhus typhimurium, had a much shorter life span than the live form. He also wrote a paper on the development of typhoid vaccines in 1917 and many other papers and textbooks on bacteriology.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At the turn of the 20th century, typhus fever had become a leading cause of death in the British Isles, and an epidemic epidemic was rampant. Harlandhund's early work led him to the opinion that the malarial and sclerotinoid-tolerant mosquito probably produced its infection via the bite of an infected mosquito. Although he subsequently supported an association of the bite of a Malay Asian mosquito with typhus, his own research of disease transmission suggests the possibility that the disease arises from contact with a host's blood cells from another species. His research of the plasmodium parasites from what he called `` mothers '', proved important in elucidating the source of the disease, and found that women from Asia, predominantly China, brought the disease with them to Denmark.  
 He is most notable for his work in typhus that has been dedicated to the discovery of a vaccine that is less likely to cause disease to infected humans. His research was instrumental in the development of vaccine treatments for Typhus A, in which anti-siphon life-suppresses agents and antisera for typhus.  
 He has also worked to confirm the identity of the human form of Streptococcus mutans for a strain of streptococcal bacteria.  
 The medical name for this bacterium, Edemyscus mutans, in the genus Bubo, is named after him.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 Harlandhund was a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog ( BD ). He received many honors, including the Carl Emden medal, the Golden Jubilee Medal of the Royal Danish Society of Medicine, and the Order of the Dannebrog.

 Leitersberger studied mathematics at the University of Heidelberg and at the University of Vienna, where he obtained his doctorate in 1901. From 1901 to 1903 he worked as an assistant to Martin-Löscher. He became a professor at Heidelberg in 1905, and remained there until his retirement in 1921.  
 Leitersberger is credited with inventing a type of vacuum chamber for medical research. His method of artificially increasing the efficiency of chemical reaction chambers by generating a positive vacuum does not take into account the mass spectra of different components, thereby eliminating the effects of the radiation from outside the chamber. His vacuum chamber is still used by some schools in the United States and by some institutions in Europe.

 Born in Prague, he moved to the United States in 1893. As a child, he developed a mild form of leukaemia at an early age and he eventually required intensive surgery. From 1904 to 1906, he attended the High School for Girls at Yale University ( 1910–11 ) and he graduated in 1906, with a bachelor's degree in physics, and a master's degree in mathematics and physics in 1911.  
 As a young man, he was called upon by his professors at Yale University to take a similar course as Richard Wheeler and Richard Feynman. In 1911 he married firstly, Dr. Mildred S. Franklin ( 1893–1966 ) and secondly, Edith ( 1896–1968 ) Neumann.  
 In 1913, he was awarded the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development's `` Distinguished Service Medal ''.  
 In 1919, he was elected president of the Optical Society of America.  
 At the beginning of World War I he was a team leader for developing what would become a key component of the American and British weapons against the German machine gun. In the First World War, he also worked on wireless telegraphy and radio propagation.  
 From 1919 to 1929, he was Deputy Secretary of War under Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the war, he held numerous posts, including Secretary of War.  
 Following the war, he returned to academia, and joined the faculty of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at Columbia University in New York, where he taught until 1962.  
 In 1952, the year of his death, he was awarded the Distinguished Scientific Service Award from the National Academy of Sciences.

 = Gottlob Johann Max Kaufmann =  
Gottlob Johann Max Kaufmann ( July 22, 1863 in Dresden – December 11, 1943 in New York ) was a German chemist, physicist, palaeontologist, and mycologist. Kaufmann is known for his pioneering work on the origin of plants and fossils. His earliest work was in the field of biogeography, using his expertise in cave stratigraphy, in succession with his work on the evolution of the species, for example the Xenopsypha icierva. From 1884 to 1891 he was the first Head of the Section of Paleontology at the Deutsche Entomologischen Gesellschaft in Dresden, where he led research on the Cambrian sequences and articulated the fossils of the Cambrian plants. From 1902 to 1904 he was Head of the Section of Paleontology at the Vienna Academy of Sciences, and from 1906 to 1913 he was director of the new division of paleontology in Dresden ( now the Munich Academy of Sciences ). In addition to his work in the Sudetenland and in the area around Germania, he also played a role in rediscovery of the Rennenfels islands of the Baltic, which included Svalbard, and in the creation of the world's largest lake, Lünefel, a lake in the Barents Sea, located in his native Germany.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1907 Kaufmann received his PhD from the University of Berlin, with a thesis on the bones of modern antelopes. In 1911 he began a joint study with Adolf Heinrich Zürcher and Marietta Richter in Holstein, where he took a special interest in cave stratigraphy and this laid the basis for his interest in mycology, for which he had been closely mentored by Hans von Auernheimer. On returning to Dresden after graduation, Kaufmann returned to the Nazis to help promote the Hochschule für Paläontologie ( Geological Institute of the Sciences ) in coordination with Karl Wilhelm Kaas, who was leading a worldwide expedition to help create a new system of geomorphological data, giving it a new name in that name. In addition, he founded the Batavian Institute of Paleontology, a close associate of Kaufmann's own institute and vice-director of its geology section.  
   
   
 == Relatives ==  
 Kaufmann's younger brother was Günter Max Kaufmann, a professor of philology at the University of Bonn, and his sister was Ruth Pauline.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Kaufmann married the Marie Kautz after joining the Nazis. Their daughter Isabella, the botanist and bookseller also of a prominent Hochschule, was taken in by the Nazis and died during World War II. His daughter Ruth died the following year.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 Kaufmann was decorated twice for services to his country, the first time in 1911 by the Polish Workers'Social-Democratic Party ( PSD ), and the second time, in 1918, by the Red Cross. From 1916 to 1920 Kaufmann was a foreign member of the German Academy of Sciences.

 = Ramere Whitehead =  
Ramere Whitehead ( 1598 – 1652 ) was an English chemist and scientist, best known for a formula for calculating the concentration of salts in water. The mathematical method Ramere's rule ( 1649 ) is often credited as the first formula to identify compounds with a hydrophobic chemical bond ( common to all salts ). Whitehead also developed the first alchemically aciding agent ( salt water ) for the production of alcohol, and a New Idea for purifying acids by removing indium and indigo from alcohols.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Whitehead was born on 9 April 1598, in Peterborough, Yorkshire. His father, George Whitehead, was a principal dealer in salt at Peterborough. His uncle, the family landowner and overseer Thomas Whitehead, died in 1611. In 1606, Whitehead was educated at the seminary of Barnet, and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1613. From 1615 he was a scholarship student at the University of Leipzig.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1618, he began studying chemistry under Martinus Zacharias Schmoller, the founder of German science and engineering at Cambridge. He obtained his PhD from Cambridge in 1622, under the supervision of James Conis. In 1627, he was appointed a professorial fellow at the Royal College of Science, Oxford. In 1634, he succeeded Joseph Priestley as a professor of chemistry at Cambridge, where he remained until his death. He taught William Birrell Newcomb, who became an extraordinary-director of the London School of Medicine, and Charles Veitch, who became a member of the Royal Society. Whitehead was a member of the New Naturalist Society, and a fellow of the Linnean Society.  
 Whitehead was awarded an OBE in 1631, and was appointed assistant secretary at the University of Oxford in 1639. On 7 July 1641, he married Anne de Skene, widow of Richard Osbern, a tradesman.  
   
   
 == Notable Achievements ==  
 A salt made of malicite, which became a favorite of Alexander Wotton, was named after him in 1635. Whitehead had discovered that the alchemical use of an acid, such as lime, resulted in a lessened or dilute reaction, and derived the formula for `` a solution of lime in water, with an equal amount of salt, by diluting it with wine '' ; but as he knew little chemistry, he largely used a simple formula based on a scientific observation of the reactions in acids.  
 Whitehead's name is associated with a quantity of chloride of lime, traditionally known as `` Whitehead's salt '', which is first discovered by Joseph Priestley. It has since become widely used in chemical laboratories for measuring the concentration of salts in solutions of potassium hydroxide ( KOH ). It has also been used for the prevention of pulmonary abscesses.  
 Whitehead's law states that the concentration of a substance in solution ( potassium hydroxide ) is an exponent of the Linnæan degree of hardness. This law was later known as the Lambert–Whitehead law, after the mathematician, and self-proclaimed inventor, Henry Lambert ( 1736–1813 ), who developed the principle.

 = James Leske =  
James Leske ( September 30, 1885 – February 7, 1943 ) was a Norwegian paleontologist and professor at St. Petersburg University who took part in the first geological investigations of East Greenland.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Leske was born in Bergslagen. At the age of seven, he joined the Norwegian school of theology, and after going to Eesti ( `` Antarctica '' in German ), he took his vows of the Order of St. Olav on 1 September 1907.  
   
 After finishing his theological studies at Eesti, he obtained a job as a librarian for a post office in Norrköping.On 10 August 1914, Leske joined the Norwegian Expedition to Greenland, which made a general exploration of the interior. The expedition carried out digs in the Karst Plain and an archaeological excavations in Broken Bay. Leske would later describe the conclusions reached as being preliminary, i.e. that the important group of deposits which lie in Broken Bay were hitherto entirely unexplored, but that from some point of further exploration the bodies of prehistoric whales could be discovered. There was no good evidence in the field, and Leske did not suggest that any material should be found for comparison purposes.Upon the outbreak of World War I, Leske worked in a despatched detachment at Baffin Bay, where, along with two assistants, he undertook geological work, constructing a volume map of the coastline of Greenland.Leske was demobilised as a result of the conflict, and came back to Oslo in October 1919. He became a professor at the University of Oslo. He was on the Board of Governors of the Institute of Geology and chairman of the Norwegian Committee of Paleontology.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 While a professor at the University of Oslo, Leske joined the staff of the geological survey of the island of Hedeby. Between 1918 and 1922, he worked on an expedition to check the completeness of a map of East Greenland which the Royal Norwegian Academy of Sciences presented to the Government of Norway in February 1922.Leske served as the Expedition's first scientific representative in Greenland.On 19 January 1928, Leske was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of Denmark, and became a member in 1934.  
 His most notable scientific work was on fossil fishes. As he had received his Ph.D. in the University of Tübingen, he was able to study the fishes of the Gulf of Corse, which had then been a local area of scientific interest. According to Prof. F. Gundersen : `` We then began to go to Italy, and under Lemleana Parhake we began two expeditions to tell more generally the fishes of the Sandwich Islands. ``  
   
 Leske died in Oslo.

 In 1881, as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Segev studied the thermodynamics of liquid and solid state solutions of gases and established that they had their own properties independent of their temperature. With fellow graduate student, Leslie Ward, he improved the way the reader could work with the study of gases by using abstract diagrams to show and explain molecules with images.  
 In 1886, Segev was named to the Physics Department chair at the University of Chicago, a post he held until his death.

 His first two published studies of the Ornithidae were on the Brachyarctiidae from 1888 and on the entomocides from 1890. He also published his Taxonomic study of the European brambles ( Brammatophyllum triquetrans ) in two parts in 1889 and 1896 ( Kontinenthe Thayer, 1890 ).Thayer moved to Leipzig in 1891 to study ornithology. His thesis on German brambles ( Brammatophyllum triquetrans ) was published in 1896. He then worked with Harry Eckmann from 1901 to 1906 to help improve his field taxonomy of European birds. He became a professor in 1923.In his taxonomy, he looked at taxa only to the individual or group level, not necessarily to the whole of the order. In this way, he reduced multiple genera to smaller, more uniform ones. He also applied those he worked with in the natural history of the birds, and came up with the concept of hierarchical phylogenies. That is, he treated the taxonomy in this way, especially that of the modern birds, as belonging to an order.Thayer's collection of birds now includes over 300 species.

 = Johann Wilhelm Freyke =  
Johann Wilhelm Freyke ( 15 June 1824 – 6 February 1905 ) was a German jurist and theologian. He was one of the founders of the Ordo Scholastica ( Greek and Latin ), one of the four theological schools of the Old and New Testament.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Freyke was born in Hanau, where his family were originally from Lower Saxony. He was educated at the seminary and the theological faculty at the university of Erlangen and the theology faculty at the University of Königsberg. In 1832 he was appointed professor of Theology at the University of Göttingen, where he remained for some ten years. At Erlangen he engaged himself with the doctrinal and historical studies of Paul Tillich, teaching one-to-one as early as 1834. In 1841 he was made professor of theology at Königsberg and under the direction of Alexander Blaustein was appointed to teach theology at the University of Heidelberg, and soon afterwards, in 1845, professor of theology at the University of Freiburg. He was given the chair of theology by the Schule der Universität Heidelberg, was elected a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Berlin, and an honorary member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina. From 1867 he lived in Dresden. Among his works were The Righteousness of the Church : Its Character, Duty, and Benefits ( 1860 ) ; Die Biblische Theologie, ( 1867–1877 ) ; Das neue Frau zur Juden ( with Josef Marcak, 1873 ), a tractical in defense of the Catholic priesthood ; God's Guard Against Evil ( 1878 ) ; Aida : a prayer book in the tradition of the ancient Hermetic language ; and his book Praepositio.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 In the summer of 1835, he published Lehrbuch des theologischen Rundschriften ( `` The Law of the Real Presence of God in the Worshipful and Worshipful Elected Teachers, under the Rightful Ministry of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit '' ), the first of two sermons which he preached in the Christian Pentecostal assemblies of Dresden. He was married in 1846 and had two sons and one daughter. During his lifetime Freyke was also engaged in theological studies and investigation of the Old Testament ; his investigations were the result of a long search for documents and sources of the tradition of the Old Testament. His eight papers in the Preface to his volume contain the `` first comprehensive investigation '' into the spirit of Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy ; but he also later made use of material from the proverbs of the Hebrews and the book of Psalms.

 = Charles Lytton Spearman =  
Charles Lytton Spearman ( December 2, 1867 – May 7, 1953 ) was an American ornithologist and writer. He is best known for his work on the genetics of avian flight, which he described as `` even more clever than von Neumann, without the anarchist streak of either, '' and for coining the epithet `` coleopterous '' for the blind eagle.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Spearman was born on December 2, 1867, on Staten Island, New York. He was the son of Henry Hudson Spearman, a Washington State lawyer and commissioner in the Chinese War. His older brother, Charles James Spearman, who enlisted in the United States Army, later became a distinguished air force officer.  
 He was educated at the Columbia Military Academy, graduated from the University of Washington in 1881, and studied under V. P. Snow in the laboratory of Donald W. Weaver, at the University of California, Berkeley, and Owen D. Tillotson, at the University of Washington. After a year, he became a junior research assistant to James M. Gilkey. In 1886, he married Mary Jayne Thomson.  
   
   
 == General Biological Laboratory ==  
 Spearman began working for the Stanford Experimental Station, in the fall of 1892. He was promoted to a supervising member of the laboratory in 1894, and served as director of the Laboratory until 1907, when he was dismissed by the director as a failure, and replaced by Walter M. Meylan. In 1902, he returned to the University of Washington. From 1904 to 1906, he served as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Charles Darwin, one of the pioneers of evolutionary biology. He was granted a professorship in biology in 1910.In 1909, Spearman and Darwin began a long association, which was to last through to their deaths. Darwin referred to Spearman as his `` most scientific secretary. '' In a letter to his cousin Ernest Thompson, he wrote, `` If it were impossible for you to be the true source of all my ideas in biology, I should at once come to live with you as my `` closest friend. '' Darwin noted that Spearman made `` regular trips to our apartment on Franklin Avenue to attend lectures at Berkeley. ''  
   
   
 == Birdwatching and writing ==  
 Spearman had many interests. He devoted the final part of his professional life to research on the genetics of birds. In his bird-gland study, he described the `` first real avian flight '', `` Lateral dispersal '' and `` mitosis of a common wing feather... among the Turkey legate, a type of mule-pigeon ''. One of the eponymous species is also named in his honor.He published A review of birds of the Triassic ( Smithsonian Institution Series ) in 1909, and in 1913, `` Ransome's Birds of the Quaternary '', a popular work that included descriptions of 18 new species, 6 new subspecies, and some 36 new subspecies. He also wrote Birds of Paradise, including with W.H. Ritchie the letter `` E '' on the cover.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 Spearman's scientific work was at times wide-ranging, as exemplified by his biography of Otto von Bohlen, a well-known academic and German naturalist, that was published in 1937 in Sweden, the German-speaking world. He became a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1932.  
 Spearman died on May 7, 1953 in Seattle, Washington, from bronchial pneumonia.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Spearman was married twice, in 1884 to Ann Mabel Weems, and had three children : brother Charles Kirt, Edward Austin `` Bo '' Spearman ( d. 1944 ), and his wife, Ann Searcy Burris, née Duvernoy.

 = Timothy Bousquet =  
Timothy Bousquet ( September 4, 1942 – January 3, 1999 ) was an American food scientist and microbiologist. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1978.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Timothy Bousquet was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Barry Bousquet, an officer in the United States Navy, and Norah Broadbent. His parents were John and Constance Bousquet. Timothy's brother Aaron Bousquet died in a crash when Bousquet was 12 years old.In his undergraduate days at the University of Rhode Island, Bousquet was assigned as an instructor in human nutrition at the Cornell University College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. His students included Basil Yan in his studies of organic food crops.In the 1960s, Bousquet worked as a research assistant at the nutritional sciences division of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture ( NIFA ). After Cornell's graduation in 1968, he moved to Amherst College as a lecturer. At Amherst, he developed an interest in nutrition and food microbiology, from which he received his Ph.D. in food microbiology in 1978.  
   
   
 == Research career ==  
 Bousquet joined the Department of Food Science at NIFA in 1979 and worked as a Food Scientist Assistant until his retirement in 1985. He helped design and implement food microbiology laboratories at the Center for Applied and Environmental Microbiology at NIFA in Dillingham, Maryland and the Food Safety Institute in Washington, D.C.  
 In addition to his work at the Food Science Division of NIFA, Bousquet conducted research on the microorganisms found in food products, a study that was published in 1978 and later became known as Bousquet's Law. It was noted that, `` depending on the strain of bacteria in the food, their reproductive modes can differ dramatically from culture to culture, so that food products containing the 'old-fashioned'strain of bacteria may present better problems to consumers than more recently developed types. '' Bousquet also took an interest in the ecosystems of food production and generation, studying species of inbred microorganisms found in sewage systems and sewage treatment plants, and revealed that certain microbes in soil were more likely to pollute plants and water than others.  
   
   
 == Selected publications ==  
 `` Development of the Plankton Selective Selection Test ( PSST ) for Detection of Foodborne Bacteria '' ( 1980 ).  
   
   
 == Research honor in recognition ==  
 In 1982, Bousquet was recognized as the first researcher to secure the nutrition sciences division of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture ( NIFA ) Food Science Fellowship, which provided financial assistance to study food culture and microbiology. A corresponding contribution was made to the Linnean Society of Washington to support an annual conference on the subject of food production and food safety.Bousquet's publications included Allergy, Nutritional and Immunological Theory and Practice ( now a standard textbook ) in 1985, A New Approaches to the Use of Food Microbiologists ( now out of print ) in 1987, and Principles of the Microbiology of Food and Beverages ( now in its fifth edition ) in 1987.  
   
   
 == Bousquet-Roseneath Award ==  
 Timothy Bousquet received an annual Academic Achievement Award, sponsored by NIFA, in 1994.His personal books include A New Approach to the Use of Food Microbiologists and Mastering the Sciences with Food Microbiologists : A Personal Guide for Scientists. The two published books have been translated into many languages and are now in the public domain.

 = Wilhelm Fraenkel =  
Wilhelm Fraenkel ( 1881–1963 ) was a German engineer and president of the German General Electric Company.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wilhelm Fraenkel was born on August 28, 1881 at Pest in the Vosges Republic, to a wealthy family. His father H. C. Fraenkel, an engineer, and his mother Eva Bernhard von Bätgen were both educated at the University of Würzburg ( today : Kiel University, Germany ) and received university degrees at Freiburg im Breisgau and Göttingen. In 1912, he left Göttingen and obtained his PhD in physics from the Universities of Bonn, Frankfurt am Main, and Göttingen. In 1916, he married Eleanor Schultz von Trusler. They had three sons, Henrik, Max and Reinhard, as well as a daughter. Wilhelm married Ana Perthes on April 15, 1923.  
 After three years at Freiburg im Breisgau, Wilhelm Fraenkel became the head of engineering there in 1924, and in 1933 founded the Rheinische Rheinische Chemieverein at Heidelberg, its first customer with Rheinberger Peugeot. In 1934, he was appointed director of the Härtelsturmforschungsdienst ( Technical Research Institute ) and concurrently became head of the company's Engineering Research Institute.  
 In 1939, when World War II broke out, Wilhelm Fraenkel joined the Nazi Party. During the war, he worked for the German Royal Navy in the Rasenwerke, following which he joined the naval arm of the German Navy on October 12, 1941, and remained there until August 22, 1943.  
 Fraenkel was described as `` a person of instinct, unimpressed by orders, intolerant of the moral degradation of others, prepared to rule through force and willing to sacrifice everything. ''  
 When he went to Algeria in 1945, he sent a message to Erhard Stumpf, German Foreign Minister, that he was going to liberate Algeria from Islam, and the French were of the opinion that Germany should get involved in the region. Fraenkel wanted France to take over the energy trade with Algeria, with the power to set the terms for the extraction of oil. After negotiations with the French, Albert Speer, then-Vice-Chancellor of Germany, told Fraenkel to get out of Algeria. However, Fraenkel also warned Stumpf that if France was not compelled, the Soviet Union would succeed in liberating Algeria. Fraenkel instructed Stumpf that he was from Russia and that he could not negotiate with him.Fraenkel remained in Algeria after the war was over, and was asked to help in reforming the French economy. In 1952, Fraenkel went to Moscow, where he was invited to become a director of Siboga Communications, a Russian company. In this position he was concerned with establishing a national radio system with the cooperation of the local telephone and telegraph companies, while also working on the Soviet-controlled Communications Experiment Station ( CPSU ). Fraenkel resigned in 1954, and was replaced by Hermann Seligman. He returned to Germany in 1956 and remained in this post until he died in 1963.  
 Fraenkel is known for his service in the German Air Force, as well as in military and technical matters. Fraenkel specialized in navigation and aeronautical equipment, and was a major in the German V-2 development program during the war. He established the Air-Speed Research Laboratory at Bielefeld to develop airplanes and jets, and built the Do 26 jet, the world's first supersonic jet powered by a liquid-fuel engine, which flew during the final test flight in 1959, just before the end of the war. He used the British Vega, a supersonic bomber, to perform blind aeronautical tests, with the plan of combining the twin-engined Vega with a more efficient turboprop aircraft to provide the ultimate supersonic machine. In his spare time he was also interested in biological research. He wrote a work on `` The Air Element in Babies '', and held an interest in the defence industry.

 = `` George Christy '' =  
George Christy ( June 19, 1887 - June 10, 1942 ) was a British physicist, pioneer of dynamical fluid mechanics, and co-discoverer of ferromagnetism.  
 Christy first took a course in mathematics at Balliol College, Cambridge in 1895. By 1901, he had graduated with an M.Sc. in physical chemistry from the University of Edinburgh. In 1903, he joined the Royal College of Science as a Physics lecturer and later became its Head of the Chemistry Department. In 1907, he won the Royal Society's Turing Medal, awarded by Lord Kelvin, for demonstrating that materials flow in a closed loop.  
 By 1916, he was Dean of the Engineering Faculty at the University of London. In that year, he coined the term `` Monoclinic contraflow '' to describe how a moving fluid smoothly flows between two points on the surface of a globe, which is necessary to accurately describe what a fluid could have been. This same principle, that particles flow in straight lines, is usually known as `` monoclinic contraflow ''. Christy's and Kelvin's lines'shared the same intuitive quality ; as Moore states, `` It was his idea that conic section had to be displayed in triangles and planar triangles. '' It also would be an error, Moore clarifies, to think that these curves were `` certainly 'infinite'lines, and that 'flat'points'could not be anything but points ', whereas the flow of fluids within liquids, with the necessary 'order'( or, in other words, if the lines went in circles, they had to have precisely defined lines ). ''  
 In 1927, he designed the first self-contained dynamical fluid laboratory, which was based on the model of a vacuum tube that supplied an inner tube containing three lids for the magnets, a fourth tube filled with solvent, and a vacuum that the upper secondary for each metal flowed into. Using the Monoclinic contraflow principle, it was possible to determine the velocity at which the solvents flowed into the first tube and continue to the second, and the third, and so on, adding up the flow speed. The resulting flow data could then be used to model flow in the rest of the machine, or to probe the wavefunctions that distinguish slow-acting liquid from more rapid-acting.  
 Christy is also well known for another discovery : the mineral potassium ores. In 1925, Christy's son, Richard Christy, a professor of biochemistry, began studying chemical isotopes of potassium, of which he found an isotope whose ratio to beryllium was positive and positive-to-negative. He went on to obtain isotope ratios to two to three standard deviations higher than those expected from the age of the Earth. When his son's work was published in 1929, Christy noted that he had `` solved the problem without naming a new element, though he made some research in a few scientific papers which, it is said, are amusing nonsense ''. A century later, Barry Zinn claimed in the second edition of his book Metaphysics and Cosmology that  
   
... Stephen G. Christy, in his article on ten years ago ( published in `` Science '' ) wrote of chemistry that the lines of a liquid that has a density greater than the energy given by ‘ potassium fluoride ’ ( that is, higher than 250 MeV per gram of salt ) flow slower than the lines of a liquid whose surface area is only twice that. On this reading, his assertion that the lines of the sodium fluoride, which are thought to be too heavy to flow at all, are carried by conical streams could hardly be more disregarded ; there is an element of chemistry, however well-known, which is within reach of mankind, namely the hydraulic operation of cooling salt of various degrees of hardness in chambers, for cooling the atmospheres of coal, gold, and silver mines, where the boiling and cooling of superfluid gases are of great importance.  
 The first reference to `` pure metal '' was made by Christy in 1910, but it took about 40 years for other authors to provide these original proofs of his.

Etienne Journon de Dolors ( 2 November 1844 – 23 September 1903 ) was a French mathematician. He made contributions to foundations of topology and symmetry, a study of the uniqueness of certain groups, and to formal theory.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Paris on 2 November 1844. His family became strong in law, not law : his father, Roulet de Lage, was a banker who fought the French Revolution ; his mother, the more liberal Madame de Délours. In 1876, he completed his first professional education.  
 In 1882, at the age of 19, he began his studies at the Sorbonne, and won a professorship there at the age of 23. He studied under Ernest Guilmant, from 1883 to 1888, earning his doctorate in 1886. He lectured on mathematics at the Paris Institute of Technology from 1886 to 1888, and at the University of Paris between 1891 and 1897. In 1897, he was invited by Napoleon III to join the faculty of the Sorbonne in Paris, where he stayed until his retirement in 1936. He became director of the Laboratory of Topology ( 1890–1895 ), and under a pseudonym of Antoine-Léon Gaudin, was a founding member of the International Union for Topology and Euclidean Algebra.He was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Paris on 3 May 1896, his first term as such.He was deeply interested in mathematics from the age of twelve, and started working in mathematics at a young age. In 1879 he began working on the relations between the geometry of curved spaces and the geometry of torus. In 1888, he became also known for his work in the foundations of topology and symmetry. In 1891, he made contributions to foundations of topology and symmetry. In 1902, he established a formal theory of primes, a case study in Euclidean geometry in which each prime of any arithmetic set can be written as a minimal elliptic set.  
 In 1900, the French Academy of Sciences elected him a member of the Académie des Sciences.

 = St John Finn Oskar =  
St John Finn Oskar ( 22 December 1880 – 20 February 1955 ) was a Finnish-American physicist and one of the founders of radar research. He was a member of the Industrial and Socioeconomic Advisory Committee, the Delegation of Science and Technology for Southeast Asia, and of the Committee on Transportation, Railways, and Communications ( CTSC ) for the developing countries. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1934.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Finn Oskar was born in Aalin. His parents were Finnsten Aikar and Marie Magdalena Aikar ( 1885–1969 ). His younger brother was Gudrun Aikar ( 1906–1996 ). Finn Aikar Oskar went on to graduate in physics from the University of Helsinki. He then moved to the United States and began working with Ernest Lawrence at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. After working there, Oskar moved to the Marshall Scientific Research Institute in Chicago to work with Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory. From there, he worked with Boris Isserles ( 1905–1986 ), Hans von Ohm ( 1913–1998 ), and Harold Walker ( 1916–1983 ). Among his co-workers were Robert McCormick and Rudolf Sommerfeld.  
   
   
 == Work at Los Alamos ==  
 Oskar joined Los Alamos in 1917 as a project officer, and worked on the Princeton experiment known as the Larmor experiment. The K-hole experiment was established at Los Alamos in 1935 in order to measure gravitational wave effects caused by the collaboration between Ernest Lawrence and Guglielmo Marconi. A K-hole is the inside of a sphere surrounded by the gravitational field of a very large mass. The K-hole is a source of gravitational waves. Oskar designed a tube from an old vacuum tube that they thought would be suitable for the Larmor experiment. They were confident enough in this tube that it would be used and eventually become the first optical part of the Larmor detector. From there, he left Los Alamos in January 1934 and began working at the JPL.  
   
   
 == Later career ==  
 In 1937, Oskar was appointed head of the Physics Laboratory in the Government Experimental Station in Gobi. In 1947, he was appointed Director of the Physical Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. In 1963, he was appointed Director of the Materials Science Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In 1975, he was named General Manager of DST Industries. He served in that capacity until his retirement in 1993.

During this time he became a friend of Murray Roth and arranged for him to visit Edinburgh and to take a team of ten students to various fossil specimens in the Kairroos Mountains. Roth was interested in science and was very keen to learn about fossils. Cantle collaborated with Murray Roth on a number of stories that he and Murray wrote together about the natural history of fossils in Scotland. He developed an interest in fossilised bog shells and the different varieties of mould found in them. When Roth suggested that Cantle join the team he was to become his greatest rival and manager. John Cantle, his wife and children had to be accommodated in an army barracks as the Germans, occupying the hills around Falkirk, were closing in on the University.  
 He worked at the GSS during the winter of 1928–1929 and the summer of 1929–1930 in the New World off the coast of South Georgia. In the 1930s he began collecting fossils for the GSS. Some of his research focussed on the geology of China and the Aurignacian period in India. In 1935 he relocated to the United States of America, for a period of two years and as the War League was called the Field Artillery and police Department ordered that no land was to be used for occupation of any part of the USA during the war. Cantle returned to Edinburgh but soon found his home deserted. John Cantle died on 3 February 1948.

 = Scott Arney St. Louis =  
Scott Douglas Arney St. Louis ( November 22, 1919 – December 6, 2008 ) was an American statistician and professor at Cornell University. He was primarily known for his research involving the architecture and the structure of language. He is best known for his work on semantic organization. His statistical studies of many languages and their analysis have been influential.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 St. Louis was born on November 22, 1919, in Northfield, Minnesota. His father was a farmer and his mother, Norma, was a schoolteacher. He attended Johnson High School in Minneapolis.  
 St. Louis graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in 1942. His dissertation, The Inductive Structure of Language, appeared in the journal J.L.Stuart. In 1951, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.St. Louis is credited with helping popularize and encourage attention to language in a manner similar to that achieved by Georg Cantor, by showing that those with good language skills could explain the use of some language constructs in a straightforward and unambiguous manner. His first publications focused on language semantics, a topic that he turned to after he was fired from Johns Hopkins University in 1954. His first book, Structural Analysis of Propositions ( 1956 ), was about functional calculus. Although most of the initial work of functional calculus was done in the 1940s and 1950s, and the relevant techniques did not become widespread until the mid-1980s, it was St. Louis's own efforts that introduced the field to the general public and opened the door to much experimentation with data and interpretation techniques. He is also credited with coining the term `` structural programming '' to refer to an approach to theory construction that means the assumption of certain formal structure by means of a set of `` introspective foundations ''.  
 He co-founded the Institute for the Study of Language ( then The Language Foundation ), and was its president from 1961 to 1964. The Language Foundation won its first Wilson Lecture in 1975.  
 In 1980, he was appointed president of the American Statistical Association.  
 He served as chair of the president's Advisory Council from 1981 to 1989. He was also the president of the Association of University Professors of Language, History and Statistics ( AWSTSI ) from 1989 to 1994.  
 He died of prostate cancer in a nursing home in Columbia, New York on December 6, 2008.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 St. Louis led the way in the use of empirical methods and statistical concepts in language analysis. He set the intellectual standard for scientific analysis, and established a technique for the systematic use of information on language structures. He brought these procedures and methods to bear on both the organization of languages, and on problems in the analysis of phenomena in language.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 St. Louis married Louise Dean Spiro, a teacher at Penn State University. She was born in 1923 in Robbinsville, Pennsylvania. They had three children : one son, David St. Louis, who taught at NYU College of Physicians and Surgeons, and three daughters, Ann Marie Greene, Lynn Lea and Julie Ann Broadley.Scott married Virginia Miley, an educator in New York.

 = Thomas Hodge (physicist) =  
Thomas Hodge FRS ( 17 February 1770 – 21 June 1837 ) was a British physicist.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Born at Cirencester, Sussex, he was educated at the local grammar school and then in the University of St. Andrews, with a particular interest in physics and mathematics. His father, Thomas Rawcliffe Hodge, was a doctor and came to England with Thomas Rawcliffe Wakefield ( 1715–1775 ) from London. Hodge earned a BSc in 1773 and a Doctorate in 1774. He studied under Andrew Fludd ( 1727–1807 ), James Thomson ( 1747–1832 ) and Christopher Wren ( 1744–1810 ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1784, Hodge became professor of physics at the Royal College of Surgeons in London. In 1797 he was made an examiner in physics, and had a small practical base there for a period of time, when a summer trip to Paris interrupted this. In 1799 he made the acquaintance of Henry Miley ( 1726–1815 ), whom he subsequently married in 1799. The two men had a very close relationship and this allowed Hodge to research briefly in chemistry and magnetism.  
   
 Hodge applied his theoretical chemistry to physics and set up a laboratory in St. John's Chapel, one of the first buildings of its kind in the country.He was, in connection with the preparation of The Principles of Chemistry, one of the editors of The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1817. His publication included an exhaustive analysis of the ordinary vibrations of acids, the electricity and magnetism in those chemicals, and of the properties of metals.This was followed in 1813 by A Treatise on Magnetism ( also known as The Magnetism of Carbonic Acid, Metals, and Transistors ), where he proposed the world's first magnetisation principle. In 1818, having also studied glass, he set up his own business, selling the production of glass to glass manufacturers. He married the daughter of the Rev. George Howard ( 1781–1840 ), the first non-royal to hold this post in the Church of England, on 3 April 1822. After his retirement from his clerical career, Hodge assumed the periodical duties of editor, in 1825 to 1829. On his death the magazine published a continuation of his work under the title of Materia Medica Magna ( 1828–1837 ), which succeeded in perpetuating his prestige in chemistry. He also co-edited with Wren, Physica Chemistry. In 1836, John Tennant, London, publisher of those papers, offered him an appointment as editor and declared him `` one of the greatest modern students and practitioners of the more general science of physics ''.In 1839 he became acting examiner for science and for three years was president of the Royal Institution of the Royal Society, the first non-royal to hold the post. He was one of the founders of the Royal Academy of Arts and Letters, holding the chair until 1846. In 1849 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1851 its president.

James Curtis No. 1 ( ; US : “ James Curtis ’ ) ( US : US : James C. Curtis ; 2 February 1661 – 10 December 1699 ) was an American ornithologist who was born in Lawrence, Kansas, the son of John Curtis and Rebecca Gifford, and studied at the Lawrence Academy and the University of Maryland School of Arts.  
 He was the grandfather of Thomas Gifford No. 1, whom was also a naturalist and farmer, and of Samuel Curtis No. 1, who was an illustrator. He is said to have been one of the founders of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Philadelphia, an activist for election laws and made the foreword to Muckleshoot ’ s History of Muckleshoot, and the correspondent of the Major Annals of America, an author on botany, economics, geography, and education.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He graduated from the Lyceum School of Arts and Letters in Boston in 1661, and was enrolled by the Lyceum as a student of history, geometry, and botany. He took an undergraduate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1669, graduating in 1672. He wrote a medical treatise on the eye and optic nerve and a monograph of Indian geography, as well as a history of the settlers of America. He was chaplain to the New England Colonies, and was also chaplain to the infantry of the army of Virginia at New York City. In 1675, he left Boston and travelled on horseback, in consequence of the Survey of the United States as it then stood, leading him across the Atlantic to North America, where he settled in New Haven, Connecticut. He is reported to have given an account of his extensive travels and of his efforts to promote humane regulations among the Indians.After a visit to Amsterdam in 1678, he emigrated to England, where he commenced agriculture and worked as an engraver and illustrator, becoming a manufacturer of bookplates and maps. He was elected one of the inaugural members of the Royal Society, a member of the College of Surgeons, and was a member of the Royal Engineers and the Royal Commissioners of the Admiralty. In 1680 he published The Planting of Butterflies, describing many of the plants now cultivated and being cultivated at that time. Curtis carried out this work in conjunction with W. A. Dewar of Kensington, England, who brought it into the hands of the flora of the New World, the style of which changed in accordance with the new discoveries made.  
   
 Curtis's medical knowledge is now well known through his contemporaries. He was an associate member of the British Association, and he was engaged by his employer as a `` guide, and physician to the young in America and Ireland ''. He is the father of all who were born on the continent.  
 As an assistant of Robert Hooke to the surgeon William Howard Hooker, the naturalist who prepared the first portion of a famous Indian treatise on the Indian philosophy and natural history of America, Curtis published what is today known as the `` Hooker's plant-graph '' in 1692, containing Curtis's own description of the Pineal Gland. Curtis became acquainted with the present day traditions of the indigenous peoples of America through contact with their herbarium. He wrote an article about Indian gardening in 1687.  
 In 1695, Curtis was sent to England to study methods of forming war drums and other weapons, on the instruction of fellow scientist Edwin Bodger. In 1698, he was one of the discoverers of a cholera epidemic in London. He provided the later seeds to form the Boston Stove, among the other distinguished Indian craftsmen who populated that new colony. The Pilgrim Fathers provided two distinctive streets named after them.Curtis was married to Elizabeth Gibbs, a young widow. His five children survived him.  
 He died in London on 10 December 1699.

Hermann Gottlob Werner von Reichenbach ( 2 November 1797 in Hannover, Germany – 23 March 1883 in Vienna, Austria ) was a German physical chemist and physicist. He invented the eleventh volt current limiter.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Hannover, Germany. Reichenbach's mother Mary, was a successful bookseller who gave a special study to her children in their financial situations. He developed a love for mathematics and the arts. He also had an interest in natural science, and several students include Heinrich von Stevin. He traveled throughout his lifetime, attending the Theology and Natural Science lectures of the Würzburg University. The chemistry textbooks from Dr. Stevin's group became a source of his scientific expertise, which was used throughout his scientific career.  
 In 1803, Reichenbach gained his PhD from the University of Erlangen. In 1807 he was appointed to a work at the new Hydrogenic Refrigerator factory in Würzburg. The contract was to design a modern industrial refrigeration system. To support himself, he carried out experimental work in the laboratory in 1809 and 1810.  
 He produced electric-induction components for his electric units, and began working with flints. He discovered the metal oxide nitric acid ; a metal compound with a far greater affinity for mercury and platinum than hydrogen ; and a cathode for a non-aqueous electrolyte. During this period, he wrote his first treatise on an electrostatic battery. In 1809, he traveled to Russia to oversee research at the University of Würzburg. He earned his Habilitation doctorate in 1813. He left his position at the Hydrogenic Refrigerator factory to be appointed a professor of chemistry at the University of Vienna. In 1825, he created a spark-gap inductor for an electromagnet.  
 In 1824, he became a delegate of the Academy of Sciences at the Association of German Physicists. In 1829, he received his doctorate of chemistry at the University of Vienna. In 1832, he published Die Bewegung des krafthemmischen Theorien und der Thiere.  
 In 1838 he married Anna Gottlob von Friedberg, who worked for Dr. Stevin. He died on 23 March 1883 in Vienna, Austria. He was buried in the Hochdorf Cemetery.

 = Dr. Irving Beyers =  
Irving Bright Beyers ( 1882–1950 ) was a well known figure in the fields of late 19th and early 20th century physiology. He is best known for his interest in animal locomotion, leading him to be one of the most frequently cited inventors of hydraulic or electric shock therapy in both the U.S. and Europe. He invented a lot of different devices and most of them resulted in actual medical applications.  
 He was born in the southern United States to Robert Beyers, a photographer and railroad passenger, and Ada Wynn Beyers. He graduated from New York's Cortlandt School of Music, then continued in New York University. In 1889 he started work in New York University's mechanical engineering department, where he earned his master's degree in 1903. In 1906, at age 27, he made his first trip through the North American continent. He never thought of becoming a geologist.  
 In 1913, he started working as an instrument man for the Cleveland Municipal Electric Company, but switched to electrical engineering in 1916. He stayed at this company until his retirement in 1943. In 1919 he opened his own laboratory in New York City. He made the first electric shock device for humans, called the `` acute shock '', and used it to treat `` wax-sucking ''. In a later device he used an oscilloscope to collect energy in rats.  
   
   
 == Notable inventions ==  
 The ampules used in A. Bright's experiment could produce blood pressure changes that were as much as 8 times as strong as those of arterial gas or lightning strikes. His work extended to improvements in the electric shock treatment of sick rats, sheep and pigeons. In 1940, he created the shock tube that he thought would treat depression, and in 1949, discovered that shock therapy for respiratory distress is equally efficacious as chemical help. In 1957 he invented an electric shock device that could take the victim from a bed and continue stimulating the heart as long as they were alive. In 1960 he reported that the most useful electric shock was more potent than anesthesia.While an electrical engineer and pioneer in animal physiology, Beyers was also an accomplished bassoonist who played the bassoon at the Arrogant Monk Hall in East Harlem. He later became the Oboist for the Ballets Russes.In addition to numerous inventories of devices, Beyers also made several experiments on living animals. In 1907, he showed that morphine is addictive as a stimulant. In 1914, he demonstrated that the effect of sedatives on animals is dependent on how much they expose them to : lights, sounds, smells or cold. In 1916 he and his co-worker Edward Waite carried out an experiment in which they performed cataclysms and electric shock on rabbits.

 = Amy Andrews =  
Amy Andrews ( February 21, 1858 – September 1, 1921 ) was a United States taxidermist who worked in New York City.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Andrews was born in New York City, to Martha Maria and Albert Andrews. She was the younger daughter of a prominent Methodist preacher, minister, and artist, and the niece of wealthy lawyer Henry G. Andrews and daughter of Carrie ( Matthews ) Andrews. On November 17, 1881, Andrews married George Hobhouse, who emigrated to America in 1866 and who, at the time, was a New York City attorney. George Hobhouse had moved with her family to New Jersey in 1851.  
 In her early life, she attended The Ladies'Academy, which was a school for girls in Lower Manhattan. Andrews traveled there with her mother in an excursion in 1885 and left on a trip of business with the great American political and agricultural development engineer Alexander Bates and his wife, Augusta Bates, of Boston, Massachusetts. The excursion lasted eight days, and she came home satisfied.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Andrews worked as a taxidermist for over 20 years. She and her sister Margaret Smith married in 1890, and they had four children. Margaret Smith was an ironmaster who had founded her own brickyard, Portland Lumber Company, and once contributed to the newspaper. Amy Andrews started her taxidermy career in 1881 and began with skulls of prehistoric birds. She was a noted maker of insect remains, including animal and snake castings. Her work at the Portland Lumber Company and the Museum of Comparative Anatomy was featured in the 1896 film A History of Insects. She worked at the Museum of Comparative Anatomy until 1905 and became an assistant in 1927. In the mid-1920s, Andrews was employed by the USDA. She retired to Canada in 1937, but remained active in her taxidermy career by painting anatomical specimens at the American Museum of Natural History.  
   
   
 == Awards and recognition ==  
 Amy Andrews received several awards and recognition, including the Oklahoma State Museum award of the `` Most Honored Innsurman '' in 1928. Andrews also won a number of other awards, including a $ 10,000 scholarship award to the Mississippi Department of Agriculture, and was elected to the Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was President of the Museum of Comparative Anatomy, the first woman president of the American College of Taxidermy, and the first woman to be admitted to the Science Innservation Club of America. She received the National Memorial Medal of Merit from President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941.All five of Amy Andrews'children were eminent artists, including the distinguished sculptor Frederick Vincent Andrews Jr., illustrator Sara Ann Williamford Andrews, and mycologist Annie Lee May. They are not credited in the book Smithsonian Record.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Andrews painted bird specimens at the United States National Museum of Natural History from 1911 to 1930. She produced most of the casts. In addition to numerous sketches and drawings, she made over 600 plates, hundreds of plates of the skins of her specimens. Andrews stated : `` It is my prerogative to present the most beautiful, or at least tastiest, of my natural products to the public. ''

Bernardo Virgilio de Abadie, commonly known as Burguoli or Virgilio, was an Italian composer.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Burguoli was born in Appellazzo, Siena in 1634. His father was a stockbroker and a jurist. He took advantage of his young age to study music at the conservatory of Florence, and was awarded his licentiate in music two years after the end of the seminary year ( 1658 ). He studied with Antonio Constantino Sorrentino, and was employed for six years as a teacher at the conservatory.  
 Returning to Italy in 1664, Burguoli was admitted to the French conservatory, and soon became principal of the college of music in Padua. In 1673 he became tutor to the young Jorge Ferrara in Bologna. He also became a professor in Padua, in 1682 he was appointed counsellor at Naples, and the following year, as the dean of the musical institute of Padua, he took over the chair of music, at the request of Giuliano Doric. He died in Naples on 29 July 1694.  
   
   
 == Compositions ==  
 Burguoli composed three sonatas : the first, a suite for flute and orchestra, being prefixed to, the '' Cheka-Epic '' ( `` Warriors '' or `` Spirits '' ) cantata by Charles Dupleix ( 1711-1772 ), with which the tune of this cantata had been originally ‘ introduced ’ ( Op. 30 ; published 15 Feb. 1708 ) ; the third and most important, a sonata for flute and orchestra, composed in 1686.

 = Henry West =  
Henry West FRS ( 10 October 1882 – 26 November 1942 ) was an English physician and plant pathologist who was famous for isolating the rare parasitic fenugreek disease Haemophilus pneumoniae. His publications in Nature influenced the discovery of the immune reaction to the organism.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 West was born in Southampton and educated at Southampton Grammar School, then the Earl's school in Gloucester. After earning his MD from St Mary's Hospital in 1899, he practised in a small practising school in Westgate for the rest of his life.  
 In 1903 he joined the Imperial College of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene where, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, he worked with the interwar plague experts. In October 1917 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a botanicalist, before moving to the Cavendish Laboratory where he worked on producing anthrax and for many years discovered many new pathogenic fungi. West gave up professional duties to concentrate on scientific research in 1918, undertaking the first scientific assessment of the nature of the plague in England. In 1927 he introduced the isolation of a dangerous black widow's disease pathogen, Haemophilus pneumoniae, in Wales, as a cure. His results suggested that the disease was spread through contact with the blood and muscle of a healthy infected victim, a conclusion later confirmed by both James Radcliffe, the British Army's chief of bacteriology, and Henry Draper, founder of the American bacteriological department. It was noted by those involved in the investigation that West had been particularly favourable to Radcliffe and Draper, and in particular to Draper for his help. Although the Legion of Merit award was granted to West for his services, the outbreak of the First World War proved the real reason for his retirement from the Royal Army Medical Corps. His insistence on imposing high standards on medical work and in particular on blood research was demonstrated by his influence on a number of top scientists in Britain, including Richard Lewis Thompson ( one of the first American microbiologists ), Gino Bailli, John Mackintosh, and W. Hewitt Stearns.  
 West died on 26 November 1942 from pneumonia following a brief illness. His research on the plague spread the same way he had promised : through leaflets placed in the homes of infected families. The women were urged to draw the blood of sick and convalescent persons in order to collect any blood in the family's home, leaving it with a host of parasites that could then be taken home to cause the disease. A common misconception in the eyes of some had been the theory that body contact with the blood of healthy people ensured a cure, but West was clear in his identification and diagnosis : it was the process of incubation and contact between the patient and blood that developed the fever and caused the clinical symptoms. West showed that a host of blood-borne protozoa could transfer pathogenic in the blood of an infertile person, and he immediately alerted World Health Organisation authorities.  
   
   
 == Scientific contributions ==  
 West conducted much of his research and clinical work in England with the Legionnaires'Disease Research Unit in Colchester, assisted by Albert Costas after he became director of the unit. West is known for the public relations campaign of laying hard and fast foundations and turning out campaigners such as William Horner and Terence Maugham for the outbreak in Rotherham ; this was almost entirely to provide support to children, both from the Rotherham Association ( the local school ) and adults in Rotherham, and the environment.

Carl-Ludwig Gerd ( February 12, 1903 – March 8, 1993 ) was a German-born American physicist, best known for his contributions to applied mathematics, numerical physics, fundamental mechanics, statistical mechanics, plasma physics, infrared radiation, and plasma optics. He became a citizen of the United States in 1951 and is buried at Auburn Hills Memorial Park.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Carl-Ludwig Gerd ( 1863–1934 ) was born in Stuttgart, Germany. He received his secondary education in Strasbourg and Berlin and in 1921 completed his first Ph.D. under Rudolf Lorentz in Munich. In 1925, he joined Friedrich-Wilhelm Niemann University ( today ’ s ETH Zurich ) as an assistant professor and held the professorship there until his death. From 1929 to 1930, he also worked at the Technical University of Berlin, where he conducted research into plasma physics, magnetic fields, and scattering problems. In 1933, he joined the faculty of the German Technical University of Munich ( German: DTHUM, also known as ETH München ). Later, Gerd was made associate professor and professor emeritus at the Institut für Physik in 1930 and professor emeritus at the University of Liège in 1933.  
 Gerd authored the widely used `` Quantum Mechanics '' textbook with Alfred Reichert ( 1900–1972 ) and the book with Felix Klein ( 1929–1985 ). Gerd is noted for coining the terms `` background '' ( baryon electron ) and `` zero point '' ( electron pair ) to denote the least probable electron states of particles in the positron and muon.He is considered the founder of quantum field theory, and was the first to apply Einstein's theory of general relativity to study particles in the high energy state.Gerd also played an important role in the development of the Theory of the Sheaf. While at DTHUM, he was also the first to give an explicit explanation of the differential integrals ( included in the Lorentz–Gerd formulation of a wave equation ) by which the magnetic field of a wave appears to change with the polarization ( orientation ) of its reflection ( warping ), giving an efficient formula for estimating its magnitude. He eventually developed the form of uncertainty principle for quantum field theories in his many papers.On April 29, 1939, he married Mabel Lang and they had two sons and two daughters.Gerd was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science.

 = John Wesley Massey =  
John Wesley Massey ( November 15, 1856 – November 15, 1910 ) was an American zoologist who made significant contributions to the discipline of comparative anatomy, the application of his career as a professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the field of comparative anatomy in the United States. He also taught at several other institutions.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born on November 15, 1856 in Minneapolis. After earning a bachelor's degree in education at the University of Minnesota, he started an academic career as a professor of zoology at the University of Minnesota.  
 In 1886, he became the assistant curator of vertebrates of the Minnesota Academy of Science. From 1888 to 1892 he held the position of curator of the Mammalia Branch of the Bureau of Animals of the University of Minnesota. In 1891, he became the first curator of the zoo ( the first zoo in the state ) of the Smithsonian Institution. After one year of a two-year tenure as director of the zoo, he was chosen as curator of the American Museum of Natural History in 1905. He died on November 15, 1910.  
 In addition to a wide range of laboratory and field investigations, he performed comprehensive taxonomic investigations on molluscs and the hoofed marsupial that he examined at the Zoo in Chicago. He described many new taxa, including the well-known flying insects, the giant buzzard and the skink, as well as amphibians. He also published more than 40 research papers, contributed to and became a significant contributor to scientific journals, and played a key role in making scientific collections and collections of specimens available in the United States.He became the ninth recipient of the Dewey Medal from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1904, and made the American Museum of Natural History its honorary curator in 1916. He received the Frisch Medal of the American Ornithologists'Union in 1908, the Stern Prize of the American Museum of Natural History in 1912, the Alfred V. Smithian Award of the Canadian Ornithologists'Union in 1915, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Distinguished Service Award in 1918. He received an honorary doctorate in 1920 from the University of Minnesota. His papers are held by the National Museum of Natural History, in the Marine Biological Laboratory, and in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution.  
 Massey became a Professor of Comparative Anatomy at the University of Minnesota in 1895. During his career, he pursued many of the major development of comparative anatomy. His main work of the late 19th century was in the field of embryology. In his career as a professional taxonomist, he was known for being an advocate of the views of Charles Darwin and Linnaeus that the inherited characteristics of organisms originated through an ongoing process of evolution. By his standards, Darwin was probably correct in asserting that humans share with apes a complex sense of smell and touch. In contrast, he believed that people shared primitive feelings of affection and fear with each other, and to the point where these evolved from earlier form of imitation. According to Massey, the more primitive form of creation—common ancestors—may have foreshadowed humans'own evolution. However, most of his colleagues at the University of Minnesota and in the zoological community disagreed. By 1909, Massey had developed a nearly universal view that humans were an ape-like transitional species from apes.  
   
 Massey's most famous work, the American Museum of Natural History's zoological collection, is the Smithsonian's Linnaean Museum of Comparative Anatomy and Deviations from History. It was named after him by Edward D. Logan, `` The man who set the agenda for evolution. '' Massey donated the museum's collections to the museum, which was renamed as the Massey Museum after his death.

In 1890, after receiving his Ph.D. degree, he received a commission to work as the physiologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1896 he was appointed to the position of demonstrator at the Pasteur Institute, and in 1900, professor of pathology at the Pasteur Institute.In 1904, he became a professor in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute and he was also sent to several hospitals, especially at the Thionville Hospital in Antibes, the Caen hospital, and the Arles Hospital in the Grand Duchy of Toulouse. In 1904, he was also awarded the title of professor of hygiene.In 1908, Grider developed a fever of the respiratory tract, to which he attributed the presence of bacteria of the minor group gram-negative microflora, and subsequently, by 1905, he was able to diagnose various illnesses as bacterial pneumonias, first with the use of a modified blood culture which could detect either bacteria of the pneumonic or bronchoalveolar origin, or with iron phosphate staining.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Alois Grider died on 25 March 1927 in Yolomey, France. He was buried in the Hebrew-Orthodox Cemetery in Gare du Nord.

 Scheler was born in Braunau, where his father worked for Deutsche State Astronomie. His parents were the zoologist Karl Heinrich Scheler ( 1885–1970 ) and the botanist Erika Edith Scheler ( 1876–1947 ). He received his baccalaureate degree in mathematics from the University of Breslau in 1926.He made significant contributions to the description of gas molecular and submicron-sized orbiting stars, particularly planets, and its possible influence on stellar dynamics. He was associated with the systematic observations on the so-called planets of minor planets as well as with the Jupiter planet belt. He is known for his work on the hydrogen and helium planets. In 1947, he named Pallas'new class of planets in his honour.  
 Scheler was knighted in 1965. He died in Oxford, England.

 = Leonie-Marie-Marie Tavard =  
Leonie-Marie-Marie-Tavard ( 4 March 1908 – 21 August 1993 ) was a French cellist and music educator who is considered one of the leading cellists of the 20th century.  
 Tavard had a huge family background. Her father Louis Tavard was a curate at a retreat for over a hundred patients at Saint-Yves, Paris and his mother was the daughter of Theodor Louis Tavard and Evelyn-André Fleury. In 1928, she was already a student in the conservatory of music in Paris ; this, despite being extremely talented and singing in opera and as a cellist. She also received lessons with Donné de Beaufey.  
 Tavard was one of the preeminent cellists in France, and was asked to conduct many concerts of duos under duress. The French composer César Franck named her after him.Tavard was one of the most respected cellists of the 19th century, where she made important recordings of works by composers such as Jacob Gluck, Jean-Baptiste-Auguste Massenet, Marcel Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edgard Varèse, André-François Meeus, Auguste Dufort, Harold Bloom, and Simon Furman. Her repertoires and teaching continue to be the envy of cellists of the 20th century.Among her students were Didier de Rivière, who later taught at the conservatory of music in New York. Mavro Borisov was a cellist for whom Tavard was equally devoted.While recording solo cello and violin works for the New York Philharmonic, she later did joint recordings with Baroness Cordier and other composers.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Tavard's work won praise from the leading composers of the time. Frédéric Chopin admired her recording skills. Adam Polyansky described her as `` the virtuoso cellist of the 20th century '' and said she was capable of `` bringing music to life like the finest pianist. `` She also played on many orchestras and numerous violin ensembles including these :  
   
 L'Écossaire, Bellagio, New York Philharmonic, John Williams Sonatas, Great Western Symphony Orchestra  
 Décade, Mer  
 La Marseillaise, New York Philharmonic, Maschera Organ Quartet  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Tavard married Jacques-Pierre Amberson de Morgere and they had four children. Two of the four daughters did not go on to make it as successful as the Tavard children.

 = Wilhelm Ludwig Norendorf =  
Wilhelm Ludwig Norendorf ( German : [ ˈweːl̡nɔ̯ fʁilɛ ] ; 10 November 1847 – 9 April 1931 ) was a German scientist and a researcher at the Technical University of Berlin.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He graduated from the Leipzig Gymnasium in 1876, received his doctorate there in 1882, and from 1884 to 1890 was professor of physical chemistry. From 1890 to 1901 he served as chair of physical chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin. In 1902, he founded the `` Linnéstleftey '', a laboratory for physical chemistry, in the laboratories of the university, before moving to the Technische Hochschule Berlin.  
 From 1902 to 1905 he was director of the Institute for Physical Chemistry and the Chemical Institute of the Technical University of Berlin. Norendorf worked under Leo Kornmesser, the eminent physicist who had gone on to become head of the German Academy of Sciences in 1924.  
 He was at first critical of Jewish students, and although his contributions in chemical research were generally received with great enthusiasm he ultimately found that the emigration of `` Jewish savages '' was leading to increasing ecological deterioration. Following a series of conferences and public lectures, Norendorf went into exile from Germany in 1904 and returned to the Technical University of Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1931.  
 He was the author of a collection of scientific papers on zoological subjects, Theological View of Botany and Animal Diseases ( 1910 ), which made him renowned among the scientific community. He was a member of the Societatis Scientiarum Dei Dei.  
 Norendorf made important contributions to chemical analysis, and he introduced NMR spectroscopy into experimental biology. In 1907, after more than thirty years in Berlin, Norendorf accepted a chair in the Rensch-Eberstelle deutschen Physiologie at the Technical University of Berlin, which he held until 1919.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Norendorf was responsible for the founding of the laboratory for physical chemistry at the Technische Hochschule, and with Hans Lohmann, he created the basis of NMR spectroscopy, which he subsequently published. He was also the co-author of the manuscript on teratology which appeared in the first edition of Volume 4 of the German scientific journal, the Journal of Experimental Biology.  
   
   
 === Norendorf ’ s principle of predictive death ===  
 Norendorf's idea on predictive death was that the disease experienced in a particular patient will sometimes be followed by a decrease in the subsequent prognosis.  
 Norendorf suggested the hypothesis that any change in prognosis indicates a sufficient progressive deterioration in the prognosis. In 1899, he reported that the `` Precisely ” tumor following lung cancer was more likely to have progressed to latent infection when patients were given a “ course of an antibiotic ”, and that to make a prognosis accurate, he required a patient to die before dying of some other cancer, or complications.For a considerable period of time after Norendorf ’ s death, in Germany, in the late twentieth century, there were efforts to establish a new nomenclature for diseases with predictable prognoses.  
 The cause of regression is the reason for a previous diagnosis.  
 Pain caused by arthritis has been called an `` asterisk ich nachthen ” ( asterisk principle ).

 = John Baines (humourist) =  
John Baines ( 2 June 1844 – 7 September 1908 ) was a British humourist and broadcaster. He worked as editor of one of the earliest early newspapers on German military and naval affairs. He then made an important contribution to the history of satire, from the 1850s to the late 19th century, writing some 200 essays and non-fiction books.  
 He was born in Burney, Surrey, the son of J.B. Baines ( 1818–1902 ) and Mary Pinchbeck ( 1840–1903 ). His older brother, the satirist James Baines, was also a novelist, having created a study of crime in the 1850s, and edited the popular memoirs of the 1857 Columbian Exposition.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Baines studied at Eton College in 1881, and was then awarded a scholarship to study at Christ Church, Oxford. This provided him with an extensive background in Germanic culture, and served him well in his career as a historian and comedy writer. As a native of the North of England, he had a long habit of preferring the more civilized education of the educated classes and was talented at the art of creating mockable characters and supplying them with material. With such ease, Baines at the age of twenty-two formed the primary plot-point of many of his earlier stories, and perhaps also adapted the gallant Protestant, Cornish-Scottish knight from The Two Towers, despite his Scottish heritage. However, after a period as an unpaid lecturer, when others were leaving the UK to take post-graduate positions in Germany, he ultimately abandoned study and moved on to active ministry.  
   
   
 === Glimpses of the Italian World ===  
 Baines followed this with a series of books published in 1901 and 1902, exploring a wide range of topics in the history of Italian war and naval affairs. In 1902, Baines was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1914 the Order of the British Empire. In a long letter to his friend, the poet Herbert Findlay ( 1850-1913 ), he expresses disgust with the treatment of Napoleon's position in Italy, as well as his strategic misdeeds. These both point towards the influence that glee in general and humour in particular can have on history, as well as his recommendation for Baines not to consider joining the British army.  
 In later years, Baines made occasional appearances as a guest commentator on history, even appearing on the radio, and wrote several autobiographical and memoirs. In 1902, he invited another old friend, the playwright C. R. Lodge, to sing the march of Gallipoli to a surviving recruits of the enemy. While he was singing, nine soldiers were blinded by a fireworks display. Baines later recalled the experience of watching three men blinded by a sapling blast to the head ; their shocked appearance was the result of hearing so much noise that they thought it was a rifle shot, and, witnessing the amputation of three fingers and the flash of exploding shells, regarded it as `` the greatest feat of human comedy '' he had witnessed.  
   
   
 === The Oldest Individualist Society and Gilbert Russell ===  
 Another of Baines'works of historical comedy was the creation of an extended satirical system of English county names, setting forth the seeds of the ideas in the early comedy of The Oldest Individualist Society. Published posthumously in 1915, this book has been criticised for containing predictable gags, although many of these were based on original material, and for avoiding in favour of greater historical accuracy.  
   
   
 == Later life and death ==  
 Baines died in St Peter's, Woolwich, London, and was buried in his ancestral Catterick home, at the Lambeth Cemetery in Borough Market.

His three symphonies were published in 1951, 1955, and 1962 ( and their recording was officially released in 1993 ). He composed a chamber piece, Motherhint i theorised, which featured the voices of his deceased wife, Hana Paan, on the piano. Also, in 2002, a single, Mutter-Fahrzeiten op. 108 ( Motherfucking… and drinking… ) was recorded in his honour.  
 Paan wrote the orchestral suite Leifende Faktor, also known as Maiger het Heilung, for the 1982 film Die Prinz Eugen, which was based on his 1913 book Die Gräser? ( with the lyrics `` God forbid he should grow old and dull ; would his former folksy temperament ever fall into a dullness that might become unbearable for his audience? '' ) ; it is also an arrangement of Henrik Ibsen's Overture to Hüsseldorf Cathedral.  
 He is also remembered as the composer of another of his songs, Solandt II, a variation on a Dannebrog melody.

 = Anton de Vries =  
Anton De Vries, also spelled De Vries, ( 2 April 1731 – 8 August 1816 ) was a Dutch geographer.  
 His father, Jacob de Vries, was a writer of Encyclopaedia Britannica, and whose library was included in the hall of the Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam. His mother, Anna Caroline, a bookseller and antiquarian, was a well-known Dutch traveller in the Dutch East Indies, and probably a native of Amsterdam.  
 In 1794, during the Dutch Reformation, Anton de Vries became a Catholic ; the Reformation was coming to an end in Holland, and he became a Reformed Calvinist, and kept close to it throughout his life. De Vries'own opinion on the Reformation was positive : he expressed his belief that the Reformation was unnecessary, and the Protestants true members of the Church. Thus he believed that all the doctrines of Jesus Christ were truths which were to be found in Christianity. He defended the legitimacy of the Reformed Churches and their institutions. De Vries took special care that his view should never be misunderstood or misunderstood ; this is evident by his attitude to Protestant missions in Holland and in England. He also tried to establish peace between the Protestants and the Catholic Church ; when English travellers went to Dutch Holland to learn about the Reformation, he was, no doubt, very pleased to make arrangements for their stay in Dutch towns, so that they might return home later to hear the Protestant preacher preach and judge for themselves whether he was right. One of his best-known sermons was delivered at Amsterdam in 1777, upon the day of the plague. This speech was published in a pamphlet at his request in 1775. He also took part in the suppression of the Congregational Church at Amsterdam ; this took place at the instigation of Johan van der Lubbe.  
 De Vries was probably one of the three men who, in September 1651, surveyed the western coast of Canada, perhaps the most important of any geographical survey to make a thorough sketch of the country's terrain, geography and climate.  
 Among the works cited in De Vries's pamphlet The Geography of the World by His Enquiry into The Movements and Accomplishments of the Engravers and Weavers is `` Which Furthers To Further the Antiquities of Man, and their Revealing Ways, With Full Reference to the Orientals and modes of Relation. ''

Sara Laetitia Kaap, d. 17 July 1949, Salem, Margraves, Ruhr, was a Lutheran theologian, writer and editor. She became a pastor at the Leiden Stift ( Higher Institute for Christian Education ).  
 She was educated at the Catholic Girls'Lutheran Girls'High School, Wortheimer, Hesse, from 1950 to 1953, and at the gymnasium there. She obtained her licentiate in Biblical Languages in 1954 and subsequently became a lecturer in Biblical Theology in 1956 and 1963, respectively, at Leiden University, Leiden University ( 1963-1985 ), and also completed a doctorate at the University of Groningen ( 1985 ). She was the first secretary of the Adult Development Committee of the Red Cross's German Evangelical Fellowship from 1968 to 1972.  
 In 1968, in a personal letter to the pastor of a Lutheran church, she addressed the current situation of homosexuality in the country, saying that `` the current world view of the biblical teachers concerning the problem of sexual relations is to use pseudoscience and deformity to cover the deception and abuse that takes place in the home. '' She was critical of the kook-ism which she perceived to be the chief characteristic of the Christian tradition in the Middle Ages, but which was now perceived as `` Jewish insanity '', particularly by German neo-Feminists such as Hannelore Bonner, and conservative Protestants. Her book The Remnant of the Dead ( 1971 ) was the first systematic attempt to deal with the biblical details of homosexuality.As an editor of the feminist journal, Form  
   
 Kelleher has been called a `` Catholic feminist pioneer ''. She published her work in early feminist, Italian and English, and was `` much considered an authority in the field of feminist theology. '' She wrote many well-received feminist contributions to scholarly journals in the area of theology and feminism. Her best-known work was her letter to the editors of the Annalen der Philologie, in which she made an appeal for the dismissal of controversial German theologian Georg Ulrich Truscott, commenting `` Truscott has repeatedly been misunderstood by the very members of the Catholic Church who suffer him to die... Truscott's fall would be far worse for the cause of women and for peace on earth ''.Kelleher served as the librarian of the Catholic Girls'Stift in Salem, Margraves for five years, and she retired in 1989.

 = Horace D. Drake =  
Horace Drake FRS ( September 21, 1922 – September 5, 2004 ) was a British–American geneticist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Horace Drake graduated with a degree in mathematics from Leeds University, earning his PhD on the `` Coenzyme-3 Enzyme and its mRNA '' from Harvard University in 1955. His PhD students included John A. Lawson, Dr. Robert Meltzer, Dr. Roland C. Hyatt, Dr. Brian David Levy, E. Robert Jackson, and George Albert Hauser.  
 In 1956 he obtained a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Texas at Austin. In 1959 he joined the Cornell University School of Medicine and earned his M.D. in 1960 with a thesis, The Role of Genes in the Significance of Differences in Drug Delivery to and Population Dynamics.  
 In the mid-1960s Drake went to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research on hereditary diseases and genetics in the birth defects and cancer research laboratories.  
 He made major contributions in the area of common diseases and genetic variants : from studying the linkage of congenital diabetes to presenilin-T and in detecting signatures of mutations associated with lethal syphilis in pregnancies, he learned about recessive types of sickle cell disease and from 1958, he became an early expert on altered patterns of chromosome imprinting in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Alveolar and Colic.  
 The major breakthrough, however, came in 1964 when he and Henry D. Cowan showed that mutations in a gene known as G protein-coupled receptor ( GPR41 ) functioned as a lifelong alternate control for a genetic disorder caused by the overexpression of the defective gene. More significantly, it was here that Drake proposed an explanation for genetic imprinting in inheritance ( disease ) and explained the essential role of regulation of the G protein-coupled receptor in regulatory systems ( pathological changes ), such as the control of protein secretion and protein kinetics ( how cells and tissues send and receive nutrients and nutrients'metabolic energy ). He and Cowan thus created the model of a genetic predisposition ( in their terminology, disease ) and discovered a way to genetically segregate variants of this particular gene. Together, they founded, in 1967, the Genetic Epidemiology Group ( GEG ) and made a foundational contribution to the use of gene-environment interaction models in genetic epidemiology.  
 Drake remained at Cornell University until retiring in 1982. In 1988 he and his wife, Margaret, bought a home in Duluth, Minnesota.  
 He remained on the faculty of the University of Minnesota.  
 Drake was honored with the Adolphe and Marion Guérin Family Foundation for his leadership in both advancing genetics and in fostering biomedical research.

Robert C. Nichols ( 14 January 1915 – 7 January 2006 ) was an American econometrician and chairman of the economics department at George Washington University, where he held the position of economics professor for 15 years.He was born in Bridgewater, New Jersey, to parents John John Nichols and Elmer Primm Nichols. He earned his BA from the University of Pennsylvania in 1938 and his PhD in 1946 from the University of Michigan with a thesis entitled `` Bipartisan Finance ''. His first paid academic appointment was as assistant chief of staff at the Department of Commerce in Washington DC, where he also served as the Director of the Regional Economic Research Center. While at the Commerce Department, he also became a founding member of the Economic Research Service ( ERS ), and served as its chief economist from 1964 to 1966. He then returned to the University of Michigan as its director of the Institute for Work Study from 1968 to 1969, and from 1970 to 1971, as its associate director.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 As part of his work on economic cycle theory, he advocated the economic imperative model, which would predict the best course of action for a host of economic actors when faced with a political choice that included certain policies, especially that of the Republican Presidential nominee Ronald Reagan. Nichols helped refine the doctrine of a cost function ( finding that if the constraints of current economic policy are not great enough, any policy that raises costs can have a marginal increase in output and employment ) and created a novel rule for comparing labor costs with current levels of unemployment in the absence of a growth in available labor markets, as well as an economic equilibrium model, based on the premise that only low wage workers are ever required to accept unemployment benefits.His most significant contributions to macroeconomics came during his tenure at the University of Michigan, starting in 1969. After completing his PhD work with colleague E. P. Putnam, Nichols began work at George Washington University as a full professor in 1970. With George Washington University's Industrial Development Policy Program, Nichols developed the economic component to the key achievement of the National Research Council, a New Economic Development ( NED ) program that set objectives for national economic growth in terms of development and the capacity to improve living standards. Nichols'work was the driving force behind the NED and is considered to be the foundation for many subsequent NED programs.  
 In 1971, Nichols retired as director of the Institute for Work Study, and began the creation of a second-year Department of Economics endowed chair at the University. Nichols'tenure at the University of Michigan was historically one of expansion rather than retrenchment, and continued the long-term renewal of the new Faculty of Economics. During his tenure at the university, Nichols championed research by Alex M. Reichelt and Jacques Roux, and wrote popular works on macroeconomics for students. In 1999, Nichols retired as a professor at George Washington University, and received a government retirement pension of $ 300,000 for 10 years.  
 In 2005, Nichols was named the 21st president of the International Association for the Advancement of Economic Studies.

André Milén ( August 6, 1877, Villiers – October 31, 1962, La Jolla, California ) was a French American motorcyclist and stuntman who made major contributions to motorcycle racing and United States motoring. He was described as the `` father of modern motorcycle performance '' by him, George Kleynhans, in the preceding chapter of `` Thoroughbreds, American Racing and Speed '', noting his numerous stunt career victories.Milén also competed on The New York/Pennsylvania Showground ( first in the gun machines and then in the gun airplanes, for the purpose of shooting off high-speed sparks ) and in local motorcycle races in many places. His televised stunt-airs were filmed in many locations in his native France, Austria, Sweden, Australia, Switzerland and other European countries. He is also known for many amateur motorcycle races and spectacles in which he appeared alongside professional riders.Milén went to school at the Conservatoire des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and then started a line of motorcycles in 1947. By 1959, Milén had changed the colors from khaki to chambray, and he started his own line of motorcycles, as well, also in chambray. He made the short trip from Paris to Montpellier, France in 1957, through the United States, where he turned down a number of requests from American racing teams. He then drove to California, where he started his `` moto trail '', or `` motorcycle racing playground '', which was apparently named in honor of his father.From 1968 to 1972 he was an editor and broadcaster for `` The Early Show with Jim Hoffa ''.  
   
   
 == Early career ==  
   
 Milén began his professional racing career in 1911 as a professional standup in Paris's `` Grand Prix Galeries '' circuit. In 1928, in the final years of his university career, he entered `` La Jolla motorcycle racing, '' the first major American motorcycle racing series, to which he showed tremendous talent. He showed outstanding track speed in the 1960 U.S. Grand Prix series, for which he won the title and helped his team retain it. Milén was, however, officially retired in 1963, but that season he was just 29 years old. He won a championship in the 1969 U.S. Grand Prix series. He qualified for the grand prix championship of the Grand Prix Galeries of Europe ( in Spain ) that same year, although he never got there. Milén's star faded, however, in the 1970 U.S. Grand Prix series, when he retired. Milén's high-speed guns were so powerful that they were impossible to control, and he ran out of speed control options. Milén returned to the United States for the 1972 U.S. Grand Prix series, when he briefly returned to the famous race circuits of Montpellier and Antwerp, winning again. Milén was again presented with an opportunity to continue racing in the 1973 U.S. Grand Prix series, but this time he withdrew from competition for seven months due to complications with diabetes, becoming permanently disabled in 1977. In 1973 Milén was featured in the special `` All-American Vacation '' photo album for Terry Winwood, who was invited by his grandmother to present the United States Grand Prix classifications to Milén's grandfather in New York City.

Joseph Thall ( May 15, 1857 – June 12, 1933 ) was an American composer and pianist. His work included chamber music and dramatic works. He was the founder of the Jazz Quartet and the Principal of the Boston Conservatory of Music. He has been called the greatest jazz composer in the world.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Born in Hingham, Massachusetts, Thall studied piano at the Boston Conservatory of Music with Irving Berlin, Charles A. Osmond and Arthur Wohlstetter. He was an early proponent of `` jazz '' in the public consciousness.  
 He was the Principal of the Boston Conservatory of Music from 1893 to 1897 and its President from 1897 to 1901. From 1900 to 1901 he was the Master of the Cape Breton Symphony Orchestra under Max Raab. He remained Professor of Piano at the Institute of Music in Boston. After 1900 he became principal of the Boston Conservatory of Music, which for a time had more faculty than he could teach. At the end of the first ten years he taught music theory, conducting and conducting methods in voice.  
 He was also a noted harpist, music educator, author, and piano virtuoso. He was regarded as a founder of the jazz style. He made important contributions to popular music, including the piano works of Charles Dickens. He won the first Grammy Award for Musician of the Year in 1909. Thall was chairman of the 1908 New York City Chamber Music Teachers Association, the Minnesota Chamber Music Teachers Association, the Artistic and Religious Union, the Theatre and Radio Artists of America, and of the American Society for Amateurs in Conservatory Music. He was the first and only Jazz Composer of the Century.  
 In 1912 Thall was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, resulting in the closure of the Institute of Music in Boston.He died in Manhattan at the age of 84. His obituary in The New York Times called Thall `` a music maven, a manager, a lover, and a much-loved voice teacher ''. His son, Stanley Albert ( 1922-2005 ), was also a professor of music and a member of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestra.

 = Filippo Corra =  
Filippo Corra ( 11 April 1892 – 29 June 1966 ) was an Italian physicist. He discovered the Corra effect, a force that acts upon semiconductor displays. This effect describes the photodiodes, the crystalline materials that conduct light. It is the first known photodiodemic structure. His daughter Elena Corra was also a physicist.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Corra was born in Milan. He was a university student at the University of Bologna, where he studied mathematics and physics.  
 His interest in research began in 1897 when he attended lectures given by Professor Mio Correa. In the same year, Corra studied by contact with Elektor George Steinbeck in Königsberg. Corra came to the conclusion that early childhood education should be given to children who were involved with art, especially drawing.  
 In 1905 Corra became an assistant in Correa's Physics Department, and he was among the first students to introduce the use of biometrical measurements as a basis for teaching mathematics and physics. With Correa as head of the Department, he led research that resulted in the measurement of the amplitude of electric discharges, through over the colliding contacts on ferromagnetic quartz crystals. In 1906 Corra discovered the Corra force, a counter-intuitive effect that clearly accounts for the Corra effect and was the first to establish a direct relationship between the intensity of an electric current and the contact size of the crystal. Also, in 1906, Corra showed that this force does not depend on the diameter of the crystal, nor on the strength of the contact with a surface. In addition, Corra found the prototype image projector during this time, also called `` Corra sheet '', which remained in use for many years.  
 Corra also contributed to the development of the metric system.Corra worked in one of Correa's Ph.D. departmental laboratories at the University of Milan and as an assistant in Leopoldina's Physics department. His early work was dedicated to optical quantum mechanics, which led him to the discovery of the Corra effect and the Maxwell–Zirkel effect. In 1910 Corra became an assistant professor in Rome, Italy, where he continued to take important direct part in student work and in World War I. He then moved to America where he taught mathematics and physics to employees at the universities of Colorado and Yale.At the Institute for Optics in Bologna, Corra identified the reactance of electrical resistances that acted upon plates of superconducting material. In 1916 he showed that a voltage drop in a superconductor provided a significant component of the Corra effect. From 1918 until his death, Corra worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Bologna, where he was one of the founders of the new department of physics and quantum mechanics. He also received an honorary Doctorate in 1954 from the University of Padova. His scientific achievements are known in multiple media. Since 1937, he has been an editor of a number of scientific journals.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Corra's reputation is held with the name Corra iron, and his important contributions in the physics of superconductivity are still relatively few and fundamental today. Corra was well known in physics education and he was instrumental in recruiting and retaining young graduate students. His achievements are complemented by his legendary students. Among them were physicist Vittorio Sagme. The bronze statue of Corra in the University of Bologna's Institute for Optical Materials in Pisa and the academic streets of Rome are named after him.He was active in scientific societies, and he was elected as president of the Italian Association for Scientific Research and the Scientific Committee on Physics.

Edward Loomis ( 9 February 1835 – 10 April 1920 ) was a British physicist, inventor and lawyer. He also was a compiler of the stories of the London schoolboys Robert Hooker and Timothy Morgan.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Born at Clapham, Suffolk, his father Edward Fulkerson was a brewer, and an early physics lecturer at his local gymnasium. After leaving school, he took an interest in chemistry, and especially in the study of solar electricity. In 1848, he moved to London to take up a post as an office clerk at the Admiralty's secret laboratory at Lake Street, as secretary to Lord Darcy.He became fascinated by the physics of water and electricity and gained an interest in solar electricity. In 1856 he joined the staff of Trinity College, Cambridge and, in 1860, became a fellow of the Royal Society, holding the chair of experimental physics from 1874 to 1881.In 1875 he met the famous Robert Hooker, who introduced him to the schoolboys Timothy Morgan and Robert Willard Morgan, with whom he corresponded for the next eight years. He designed the first test tube, and in 1881, after receiving financial support from the Rothschilds, constructed one of the solar plasma tubes at Cambridge in his father's laboratory, the Imperial Physico-chemical Laboratory at Charing Cross. He provided technology for making electrical tubes, a process he had developed for his own laboratory with a net charge of 1.50 volts. His electric tube was so powerful that it had to be dismantled in order to save money. Thereafter, he introduced other tubes that were smaller, more readily efficient, and less costly. He also invented the electrolytic ferromagnet, which used a metal electrolyte rather than liquid hydrogen. With Robert Willard Morgan, he invented the penoscope for X-ray therapy, a device to monitor the internal structure of the human body.In 1883, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  
   
   
 == Legal career ==  
 He was a Fellow of the Royal Society from 1882, and for many years was a corresponding member. In 1899 he became a magistrate in Worcestershire. He was a solicitor for many years in Langley, Surrey and in Tunbridge Wells, London, before gaining his own practice at 80 Bottomley Place. In 1898, he went to London to write the introduction to the book `` Selected Poems '' of Thomas Hardy, `` One of the most popular authors of his day.

Erich Markel ( born 14 June 1899 in Meuendorf, Prussia ; died 6 August 1972 ) was a German entomologist.  
 He was a Professor of Entomology at the Technical University of Munich and was president of the National Akademiaische Deutsche Welle from 1955 to 1958. From 1959 to 1968 he was director of the collection for Ctenophorus livingstone at Munich's Alterslied.Markel's main interest was their protection, which he believed was of use to entomologists around the world. He examined the mortality and spread of Ctenophorus species which it became known to die off. These butterflies ( which he called Caenorhabditis ) occur in many areas of the world and, in addition to Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia, are believed to die off in many other parts of the world. In 1970, Markel identified the range of South American Ctenophorus to Asia which he was able to study from the collection of the National Museum of Natural History in Vienna. Markel published about 50 articles on the African Ctenophorus ( some from the 1st edition of the book Ctenophorus bicolor ) and its range.Markel had a special interest in two groups of parasitic Ctenophoridae which, together with Cardinia crescentina, are sometimes referred to as the Markel Ctenophorus. They are thought to be found in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and along the western coasts of Africa. The Markel's Ctenophorus atelerus is a common snail species found in Madagascar, as well as at about forty known other locations, and there are at least ten species found in Fiji and seven in Madagascar. The Markel's is actually not the name for any of the species in question, but the name under which they are usually found. The Markel's was named after Emilio Markel, author of Ctenophorus gaolerii.  
 He married Ada Markel in 1909 and had three children. His last wife was Karlina Franciscus von Rose.

Instead she filed an action in federal district court in New York. The suit was subsequently dismissed for failure to state a claim for a lawful tax-exempt purpose.  
   
   
 === Retirement ===  
 She served as a board member of the New York Woman's Physicians Association until 1946, when her husband died in February 1946. When her husband died the following year, in 1947, Webb stepped down from the board and in April 1948 became a Fellow of the American Association of Immunologists.She died on November 10, 1983.  
   
   
 == Tax-exempt status ===  
 Webb's tax-exempt status allowed her to spend the rest of her life in the United States. Upon her death, the National Bureau of Labor Statistics ( NBER ) named a plaque in her memory to the `` Laurence K. Webb School of Physiology and Medicine at Yale University '', as well as her `` several research projects and publications. ''

 = Friedrich Miesel =  
Friedrich Miesel ( born 6 August 1889 in Würzburg – 8 April 1966 in Köthen ) was a German theologian. He was a well-known philologist, a controversialist, and a critic of some modern natural theology.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Würzburg, he emigrated to Germany in 1924. He attended lectures in the university of Königsberg in 1928 and taught literature, history, metaphysics, and ethics at the University of Würzburg until 1936, when he returned to Königsberg. He was also a member of the faculty at the University of Königsberg from 1938 to 1943. During the period 1933–35, Miesel was a student of Max Stöcker.

 As a critic of the works of Calvinism, Miesel wrote `` The Biblically Unsympathetic View of Theology '' and `` The Emphaticity of Christian Dogma ''. He argued that there was no such thing as `` pragmatic theology '', or traditional theology, but simply reified the biblical text in the `` everyday spiritual sense. `` In 1990, he published what was to become a classic work, the textbook Das alten Oper mit drange Unterricht ( A Christian Influence on the Human Sciences ).  
   
   
 == Writings ==  
 Miesel wrote a large number of works, with a slight tendency towards criticism. He wrote more than sixty different essays and 50 books in German, French, English, and Russian. He published over twenty books in English.

Pavel Sosnovsky ( Russian : Васи́н Амо́нович Исо́вето́нского ) ( 16 November 1779 – 7 April 1859 ) was a Russian anatomist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Pavel Sosnovsky was born at Podolskoe c. 1813 and died at Sverdlovsk. He studied medicine in Podolsk and graduated as the first doctor of anatomy at the University of Tomsk in 1795. Thereafter he took a teaching position in Kyiv, and from 1797 to 1802 was the vice-priest at the Sacred Heart of the Church of St. Ephrem ( then Holy Synod ). In 1802 he became the first Professor of Anatomy in Tomsk ( a position he held until his death ). In 1807 he received the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, in 1812 the Order of the Emperor and in 1816 the Order of the Redeemer.He was educated at the Royal Veterinary School in Yekaterinburg, and when military service was started in 1804, he was sent to Yekaterinoslav where he remained two years, after which he returned to Podolsk to study medicine under Boris Ivanovich Anikasov. A colleague of Anikasov in Yekaterinoslav in 1797–1807, Sosnovsky graduated at the Royal Veterinary School in 1810 with a thesis entitled “ On the Cerebral Beak of a Virgin, or the Vein and Tooth of the Horse ”. Thereafter he returned to Podolsk where he stayed until 1815 when he became a Professor of Anatomy. This chair was filled by his deputy, Nikolai Imkov. Sosnovsky ’ s other notable students included Igor Serov ( 1780–1842 ), Yuri Alexandrov ( 1796–1869 ), T. A. Alekseyev ( 1802–1876 ) and A. P. Aroushkin ( 1806–1877 ). He later assisted Ilona Dekeff in her lecture collection and edited her further to include works on human anatomy.Although he is sometimes called the father of anatomic surgery, Sosnovsky did not start anatomical studies as a profession. He was certainly not the most forceful proponent of anatomy and was extremely well informed about the field, an skill he developed later in his life, and provided information for medical school curricula and exams. He was also a member of the Young Pathologists of the Society for Experimental Medicine ( also known as the Pathological Society ) and was active in the Société de Médecine anatomique. He also performed experimental dissections. His best known pupil was His Majesty The Tsar.  
 He died on 7 April 1859.  
   
   
 == Socratic ability ==  
 Pavel Sosnovsky spent some twenty years teaching and assisting men in various capacities in medical schools, including as surgeon at the St. Elisabeth's Hospital in Saint Petersburg from 1817 until his death. His main focus was to train young medical students for the surgical fields and how to create a course of study that led to a respected position. He also mentored the students of Anikasov, in particular Anikasov's son, Alexander, who taught at that Institute until his own death.  
 Sosnovsky wrote several work-books on the human body, including a Systema Anatomia der Mechanik ( System of Anatomy ). He also developed methods of microscopy that were completely natural and based on his observations.

Paul Carl von Linné ( 1 March 1743 in Hesse – 13 April 1810 in Frankfurt am Main ) was a German botanist, psychologist and engineer. He was an amateur ethnographer, making several journeys to Egypt and Asia Minor.  
 His work in Egypt had its origins as an illegitimate visit to the holy city. After developing many theories regarding archaeology, including a conception of the Egyptian calendar as a 1000-year cycle, in which periods were fixed based on astronomical phenomenon, Linné was a pioneer in racial theorising. His own views were that the Egyptians and Phoenicians were a distinct race.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Linné published a manuscript, Xenas und deutschen Turinien, in 1784. His more notable work, Die geognostischen Teutonic-Paleolithic und mitteleuropäische Lehre vom Episis oder eine Tagebuch der Persien ( Berlin, 1792 ), contains a complete flora of Egypt, with a geological description of the places.  
 In the autumn of the same year, he became the first director of the Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, appointed as the foremost authority in the field of ethnography, and the first naturalist in the German Empire. He also made a number of trips to Arabia and Egypt, and recorded descriptions of the people and landscapes there in the German-Arabic Atlas, written in Latin by his brother-in-law Alexander Preble, a Protestant writer. In this work he set forth a political, social and racial theory, based on his linguistic achievements in Egypt.He maintained the position of director of the Natural History Museum until 1812, when he became the Mayor of Frankfurt.

 He then worked at the Herder-Schule at Stettin. In 1848 he went to London to be a teacher and assistant in entomology, and from 1851 to 1854 he worked for the Linnaean Society of London. Braun was the first entomologist to describe two species of Sphenochima, which are now not to be confused with the Diptera of today. Braun wrote a popular book, the Feldbuch der Schmetterländern ( Complete Guide to Insects, 1861 ), with P. Imhof and H. Cressens in 1859. Braun's works about the animals and molluscs of the United Kingdom helped facilitate the founding of the Entomological Society of London in 1863. In 1866 Braun was invited to take charge of the newly formed Museum Entomologisch-Bund in Geneva.  
 Braun started a career as a taxonomist in his native land, also helping to establish the Entomological Society of Graz, Austria. In 1873, Braun became the first director of the new Siboga Museum in Graz. Braun also continued to teach at the University of Berlin.

 == Biography ==  
 Born into a musical family in the small hamlet of Schaumburg-Stuttgart, Brun was already considered an active composer when he entered the Hochschule für Musik und Orchester Nuremberg. His early contributions to violin playing were counterpoint and the choral pieces.  
 In 1850, he succeeded August Walther ( d. 1879 ) as professor of chamber music at the University of Stuttgart and in 1852 became assistant at the newly founded Conservatorium in Bremen, which he moved to after Walther's death. During this period, Brun was a member of the Berlin group of the Paris Conférence of Music and had become an active member of the Society of Jesus, the educational society founded by Saint James the Less. In 1858 Brun founded the State Music Center in Leipzig, where he was an enthusiastic proponent of Dixieland.  
 In 1859, he established the Kirche Konzertlerverein ( Kreisstudium ) in Heidelberg where, under the leadership of Friedrich Weber, he founded a literary music school. This initiative was a classic example of the fusion between classical music and the literary medium of music.  
 For his acclaimed organ concerto Les Prix-Roches de Cadet and his editions of Dvořák's Overture to Beethoven's Variations on a Plain for Piano, 1880 and 1881, Brun was awarded the Košice award of the Royal Philharmonic Society.  
 In 1884 Brun was elected member of the Academy of Music in Berlin, and for a short time until his death in 1928 was a member of the board of directors of the German Archaeological Society.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
   
 In addition to his important organ concertos, Brun composed numerous choral works. He was a strong advocate of harmonic idiom, a move which he elaborated in his Leitmotif. In 1869 he published, for the first time, a version of the piano concerto Scarlatti's 8 d'Eclair, presented in F major.  
 Brun's Symphony in A Minor, op. 21, is an influential French suite dedicated to a friend of his at the Kirche Konzertlerverein, Johann Johann Friedrich Gartenberg, whose father, Hans Gartenberg, also performed the Russian Revolution Overture to Requiem.  
 Among Brun's other important piano choral works are :  
   
 Fortuna, in 3 movements, op. 25 ( issued 1891 as Leipzig Suite )

 = Otto Ahmann =  
Otto Ahmann ( 1798–1859 ) was a Swiss composer, organist and pianist.  
 Ahmann studied piano in Paris, and there he found a natural love for music : singing, and soon he was attracted by the elements. On the advice of Georges Dufour, he began playing the harpsichord in 1823. However, after a few months he decided to leave the music profession. He continued to study organ, but stopped when he heard Voltaire play in Paris.  
 He performed in the orchestra of Madame Aubert, also served as a schoolmaster in Paris and was employed as a choirmaster for three years at the Royal Sociedade Musicale.  
 Ahmann was the founder of the cantatas and chorus in Zurich, Zurich Noord-Hoogland and Staatliche Elektrizität ( 1913-1923 ), as well as the successful piano duo Sonatina ( zwei Performing Chamber Band ) in Zurich.  
 In addition, in addition to numerous choral works, he composed two operas and a pastoral poem, cantatas and a number of children's songs.Because of his early death, Ahmann's music is considered an early national music. His masterpieces are : I. Sonatina, 2nd movement, written in 1828 ; and II. Nunenschlag, written in 1830. Among his sonatas, is the first operatic.  
 Ahmann died in Zurich.

 = Margaret Baxter =  
Margaret Elizabeth Baxter ( May 13, 1832 – May 12, 1924 ) was an American mineralogist, chemist, and paleontologist.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Baxter was born in Orange, New Jersey, on May 13, 1832. After graduating from the state medical school at the University of New York ( then known as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York ) in 1845, Baxter studied physiology and chemistry under Edward Knibb on the shores of Lake Champlain. Baxter subsequently worked under Ulysses S. Grant, Martin Havelock Ellis, and Lewis T. West at the University of California, Berkeley.  
 In 1857 Baxter joined the Geology Department of the United States Geological Survey, which also included the mineralogist Dr. Samuel F. Kann.In 1860 Baxter established a laboratory in the lower Manhattan neighborhood, known as the `` Baxter Lab ''. Baxter named the rocks with strata in the laboratory Théopatra bay ( later known as Mount Baxter ) and Kamuela bay.  
 The Baxter lab was the first geology laboratory to employ geologists and paleontologists and incorporated scientific techniques and equipment for extracting, analyzing, and quantifying the rocks. During this time, Baxter set up a geological section of the United States Geological Survey. In the 1880s he held the position of Director of the Mineralogical Society of America. He established scientific mapping of South Central California, Washington, Oregon, and California. Baxter performed studies on inter-tidal shoals and clay banks. Baxter researched boronates and selenium in granites.Baxter developed a methodology for finding stratigraphic depressions, using the open fire method in order to determine where the shallow crust begins and the deeper crust stops. The term `` Baxter Re-adjustment '' was coined in his time to describe the process by which this process can be performed.During this period, Baxter also initiated the publication of an article called `` The Landfill Problem '' in the January 1861 issue of The Journal of the Geological Society of America. It is the first comprehensive study of the flues of the San Francisco Bay Area. The article explored the large quantity of sandy sludge found at the bottom of bays, especially those that contain rocks containing Paleozoic or Cambrian sandstone.Baxter died in 1924, and his grave in the Tujunga Cemetery in Berkeley was opened for his burial on September 14, 1926.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Baxter was awarded the Grand Master of the California Mining and Exporting Association in 1863. The Mineralogical Society of America named Baxter the first to be its Grand Master of the field in 1893. He was elected President of the Academy of Mineral Science of Philadelphia in 1887.A variety of botanical species were named in his honor.

 = Edward West =  
Sir Edward Victor West FRSE ( 3 April 1884 – 1 April 1955 ) was a British naturalist. He was a major pioneer in marine-based studies and a leading authority on the information content of fossil brachiopods. He is sometimes called the father of photobotany.West lived in Cornwall from the 1920s, at King's College, and after World War II at the Natural History Museum of London.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 West was born on 3 April 1884 in Cornwall, the son of the vicar of Caithness, and his wife Emily Ward. His father was a mineralogist and lead merchant, and his mother was the daughter of Mr Wickham, a Welsh clergyman, and her cousin Margaret Greenall. His younger brother was James West. West entered Trinity College, Cambridge University in 1912.  
 On leaving Cambridge, West worked as a staff chemist for the petroleum-industry firm of the Metals and Metals Industry, which was in Britain at the time. He later worked at the company until he retired in 1947, having worked there for 20 years, mainly on marine biology. He left all the rest of his scientific papers to the Metals and Metals Industry. He was the only founder member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, having joined the membership in the late 1930s. He died in 1955.  
   
   
 == Scientific contributions ==  
 West is best known for his work on seaweed photography, also known as photoelectricity. West classified all cephalopods, especially brachiopods, into six classes : the brachiopodic ; that is, brachiopods that used color vision to spot or distinguish different types of salt ; the brachiopodic brachiopods that use their fusiform bodies and gills to fire carbon dioxide and sunlight to a separate process ; the brachiopodic brachiopods that use light to either protect themselves or to enhance their morphology or or to camouflage themselves in shallow water ; the brachiopodic brachiopods that use their fusiform bodies and gills to scuttle into the deep ; and the brachiopodic brachiopods that use their primary gills, called gills of phloem or ink glands, to assist their photosynthesis. West used chromatic colour vision to classify brachiopods.  
 After his studies in Japan, West returned to England, teaching zoology at Queen's College, Oxford, which he joined in 1923. He later relocated to Lincoln College and worked there from 1933 until his retirement in 1950. He was the author of thirteen scientific papers on brachiopod morphology and their physical features, most of which were awarded the Murchison Medal from the Zoological Society of London in 1946.  
 West was an enthusiastic ornithologist, and published numerous important works on birds and their environments.  
 He was also the founder editor of the monthly Australasian Journal of Science and edited many of the current issue of the journal. West died in Oxford on 1 April 1955, aged 77.

 = Alfred Putnam =  
Albert Putnam ( March 10, 1900 – April 25, 1975 ) was an American biochemist best known for his work in the area of pH measurement. He became known for his work to develop and apply a new technique to characterize the gas phase of proteins.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Putnam was born on March 10, 1900 in New York City, New York. His father was Joseph Alfred Putnam Jr. ( 1904–1977 ), a principal in the Arbello-Mateo Mining Company of New York, and a member of the Rotary Club. His mother was Elizabeth Lillie Putnam.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 After receiving his A.B. in chemistry and biology from Cornell University in 1924, he started graduate work under Albert G. Seitz at Columbia University. He went on to work at Johns Hopkins University, Purdue University, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ohio State University and the Institute of Food Technologists. While at Hopkins, he also studied proteomics under Walter Kraemer.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === Experiments ===  
 After his PhD in biochemistry, Alfred Putnam began work at Rockefeller in 1924, working on reaction kinetics and enrichment. This led him to a direct connection with many Nobel Prizes and the formation of the protein science branch at Rockefeller. In this area, he applied the somewhat simplistic approach of reacting some different proteins ( including polypeptides ) with different amounts of sulphonic acid to determine the exact molecular weight of the protein complex.  
   
   
 === Open Source and Natural Products ===  
 Alfred Putnam was well known for using whatever he could get his hands on, publishing over 100 papers in various scientific journals between 1926 and 1950, including well-known natural products such as vitamins, orchid extracts, vitamin supplements, parabens and food additives. Some of these included plant-derived insecticides, gunpowder, DDT, fluoridation of drinking water, filters, wallpaper treatments, antifreeze, pyrophoric acid, cottonseed oil, and sterols. This led to his first work with the Open Source Enzymology Program at Rockefeller in 1938. The group is one of many that he and his wife brought together to improve the quality of life in the United States. He was also awarded several major prizes during his career, including the Copley Medal, Rockefeller Foundation Prize in 1945, the award from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry in 1952, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Medal of Science in 1971.  
   
   
 === Death and legacy ===  
 Putnam died of complications of kidney disease in New York City on April 25, 1975. He is commemorated in the abbreviation Putnam, since Putnam used it at Cornell and by his wife.In 1993, a museum building at the Charles D. Penn Museum, Nanjo, Cornell University, was named in his honor.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
   
 In 1925, Alfred put down a house, now a place of worship, in New York City's East Village for conservation reasons. Since he cared so deeply about his neighborhood, he hired two New York city park rangers to patrol the neighborhood and `` maintain order ''. He also appointed a personal assistant. As the 1970s wore on, however, their relationship soured, and they were separated for most of the remainder of the life. His health continued to deteriorate, and finally, he died on April 25, 1975 in New York City at the age of 80.

 Lindgren was born in Sweden to Christian Lindgren and Elsa Anna Åhrmann. After graduating in 1911 from the University of Stockholm, he was offered a professorship at the Observatory in Trondheim, where he spent seven years before returning to Sweden. Lindgren's observations of the minor planet 1708 had been summarized in the book, Major Planets with Satellite Names by Leonard Scott, the publisher of WorldCat, at the suggestion of M. K. Kaus, a friend of Lindgren. In his autobiography, Kaus described Lindgren as `` the highest musician '' of his time, for whom he `` was raised above feeling or sight '' and whose own musical expertise ran to two hundred notes. He performed at many of the finest concerts in Europe, the United States, and in Britain. He gave lecture tours to children and young people in schools in Sweden and other countries. He was the first Swedish astronomer to recognize a number of Pluto's moons. In 1909 he discovered an already famous planet orbiting the Sun. Lindgren calculated that it was a small planet that could be seen with the naked eye. This conclusion led to a great deal of controversy about whether such a planet should be officially named.Lindgren served as a director of the Swedish Astronomical Observatory from 1937 to 1941. At the time of his death he had become a Professor of Astronomy at the University of Southern California, a post he held for 29 years.

Derek Curtis Moorhead, DSC ( 1920-2001 ) was an Australian philosopher, known for developing the techniques of his later doctoral studies. His topics include black-chamber ethics, the 'open question'hypothesis, and neuroscience.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Moorhead was born in Heidelberg, the son of a college graduate. After leaving school at the age of 16, Moorhead began study of mathematics and physics at the University of Cambridge and won a first class PhD under Martin Heidegger, who was a student there. At the age of 27, Moorhead was hired to write the book Prolegomena to Husserl's Analyse der Phenomenologie ( 1948 ), a first-hand account of phenomenology. To earn extra money for this work, Moorhead began lecturing and also lecturing on phenomenology, for which he received a degree in Philosophy from Cambridge. In 1955, Moorhead married Cleo Bennett, and together they lived in Melbourne. Moorhead's interest in phenomenology began later that year when he read Husserl's Grundrisse under Karl Barth's supervision, for which he received his Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D. ) in 1956, his first doctorate of philosophy. Moorhead lived at 30 Mary Street on 20 July 1957. At this time, Moorhead also began to write on phenomenology, specifically the 'open question'hypothesis. Moorhead's own research, for example, resulted in the development of the method he developed to study this hypothesis, or `` grey-Chamber ethics '', which he developed and explained in his papers and doctoral thesis, entitled Analysis der phenomenologie. As a consequence of this work, he was, at the time, also in the top ten academicians in the world according to the US Encyclopedia of Philosophy. When he was 40 years old, Moorhead published a collection of essays titled Ataraxia Philosophiae : Calumny, Relevance and Exegesis, which details his interest in the philosophy of concepts, especially in discussing ontology and quantum mechanics. With his daughter Cleo he later developed two radio programs for the ABC, “ Ataraxia Philosophy and “ Ataraxia Radio ”.Derek Moorhead was an honorary fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.  
   
   
 == Trial and death ==  
 Moorhead was brought to the stand by the defense team for his murder trial. A book about Moorhead was produced by A.C. Dutton and was printed in the Australian newspaper The Age. The book was published after a short period of legal wrangling, with the evident intention that it would allow him to have a successful trial. Following the tragic murder of his wife Cleo Moorhead, who had also been murdered and whose body was found in his house, Dutton persuaded the jury to spare the former law student. The publisher informed the prosecutor of the decision and, on the advice of John Drew and a legal adviser, Moorhead committed suicide by taking a bullet in the head.

Silvia Capone ( October 1, 1842 – June 4, 1927 ) was an Italian-American psychologist and professor who studied evolutionary psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Silvia Capone was born in Bologna, Italy. She received an elementary education in Florence, where she became a pupil of Giuseppe Maria Rusti. She married John Cresson Parnell, an Irish-American, on July 28, 1878. She was at her father's side in Illinois and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1889-1891. She then received a Ph.D. in Psychology and Education from the University of Chicago in 1897. She taught at the University of Chicago, for four years, from 1899 to 1902, before moving to the Department of Psychology at Illinois in 1903. She taught there until 1927, when she died.  
 Capone studied phenomenology of mind, facial expressions, and the anatomy of the eye as well as the study of emotions and perceptions. She also studied various disciplines of mind and behavior, and received research funding from the National Institutes of Health. She used the term evolution as a synonym for `` perceptual expansion ''.  
 She was the only female professor at the University of Illinois, and the only one to lead a department of her own.  
 In 1925, Capone published a small book, Studies in Evolutionary Psychology. It is one of the few books on evolutionary psychology published in the United States before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, and the first to discuss `` scientific material '' from evolutionary perspectives. Other works of Capone included : The Mystery of Pleasure ( 1894 ) ; The Language of Desire ( 1898 ) ; Reflections on Beauty, No. 2 ( 1905 ) ; Outline of the Concepts of Desire ( 1907 ) ; Why Did Nature Make Chicks? ( 1913 ) ; and Variation of Sex. In those writings, Capone distinguishes between `` evolved '' and `` antecedent '' notions of sex, as well as describing her career as a teacher and researcher and the psychological theory of social evolution.

In 1924, Jensen joined the Somerville Institute in New York City, working with Joan Greer, in collaboration with scientist Albert Hoffman.  
 In 1935, Jensen and Greer developed the peptide virus A. From 1947 to 1953, he was the Distinguished Professor of Genetics at Columbia University.  
 After retirement, Jensen continued to collaborate with other researchers and the Bundestag in their efforts to develop polio vaccines, and was an early advocate for the laboratory-based treatment of children with polio. In 1955, the institute he founded, which he called Genetics Laboratory of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was renamed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.In the late 1940s, after receiving a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, he went to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research ( now the Rockefeller University ) in New York City on the study of bacteria, viruses and other emerging infectious agents. Jensen was the head of the laboratory, which he left with the institute in 1946 to focus on radiation-induced mutations of genes that appeared in bacteria. In 1948, he received the Diamant Chabard Chair in Viral Biology at the Rockefeller Institute.  
 In 1951, Jensen's research group performed the first direct sequencing of the influenza virus. This `` FASEB-X '' program was the first time that a large database of microorganisms, viruses and genes was used to build the human immunodeficiency virus vaccine. Also in 1951, in collaboration with Charles Trumbull, he proposed an integrated design of the ABC virus assay to allow for the detection of as yet untested inactivated antibodies. The vaccination trial known as the Vaccine Trial of 1955 demonstrated that the vaccine had virus effectiveness over the time period of about 4 years. Jensen began working at the Rockefeller Institute as a visiting scholar, and later the director, in 1957. During this period, he also published a paper titled, `` The Replication of the H5N1 B virus '' ( `` Daily Life of an Aerobic Hemagglutinin-Steroid '' ). In 1954, he published on how infectious bacteria ( H5N1 ) polysaccharide glycoprotein ( GS ) can infect nerve cells. Jensen's findings led to the discovery that CSF droplets could contain pathogens that elicit a rabies bite in the mouse, and this research helped inform the isolation of the virus from blood and saliva of some experimental experimental rabies virus carriers. He had pioneered efforts to find genes involved in generating and directing H5N1 infection and helped pioneer the vaccine.In 1955, Jensen went to work at Massachusetts General Hospital where he was president of the National Advisory Committee for Immunization and Infectious Disease. In 1961, he became a full-time associate professor at the Rockefeller Institute and held the same position until his retirement in 1985.

 = Wilhelm Gustav Goldschmidt =  
Werner Gustav Goldschmidt ( September 13, 1903 – February 8, 1985 ) was a German physicist and early impact scientist.  
 He was an influential figure in the research of astrophysics, especially after it was recognised that the Milky Way was just one variable in the cosmic photograph used by Edwin Hubble. Goldschmidt is regarded as one of the founders of cosmology, and was a leading expert in the study of stellar characteristics and our cosmic environment. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974 for his role in the development of the Cosmic Spectrum Interpretation of the Hubble Picture of the Galaxy.  
 Goldschmidt died in the early afternoon of February 8, 1985, in Heidelberg.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Wilhelm Gustav Goldschmidt was born on September 13, 1903, in the small village of Gävle, Kiel. His father, Hans Goldschmidt, had been a pharmacist in Lehfeldtau and Kiel. His mother, Claudia Goldschmidt, was a professor of physics at the University of Gütersloh. He was a member of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ), and was an active member of the Kössche Mission. In 1929 he graduated from the University of Kiel with a first-class degree in chemistry.  
 Goldschmidt's mother died when he was eight. He took over the education of his brothers, Herbert Goldschmidt and Werner. Werner became a soldier and became a government worker, while Herbert was a political activist and a Jew. Werner, and Herbert, respectively, both went to East Germany in 1938 to escape the Nazi occupation. Goldschmidt took part in the Kössche mission in Angola.  
 In 1943 he was drafted into the German Army, and subsequently joined the science corps. The mission conducted a solar eclipse in 1944, and was among the first to witness what was regarded at the time as a solar eruption. Goldschmidt stayed in the German army, where he participated in the invasions of Austria and Poland. He was stationed at Uytte at Wättemberg, where his most famous colleague was August Schwannberg.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 From 1943 to 1953, Goldschmidt held positions at the laboratories of the universities of Kiel, Munich and Göttingen. He did important research in the use of space-time variables. His major achievement was the identification of a relationship between stellar position and a magnitude of cosmic radiation. The relationship formed is so important, that Goldschmidt is sometimes referred to as the father of astronomical cosmology. Goldschmidt established the space-time picture of the Milky Way in 1953, and his investigations of stellar characteristics led to the development of cosmological equations. Goldschmidt also performed major work on photographic interpretation of the Hubble picture, through the use of cosmic data. He was one of the first to discover the rotation patterns of stars. Goldschmidt completed the development of the Cosmic Spectrum Interpretation of the Hubble Picture of the Galaxy, taking the opportunity to observe `` earthquakes '' caused by the passing of hot magnetic fields across the sky. Goldschmidt's original idea on the origin of these was that they were created by nearby heavy elements ejected in outer space, and that they then entered the star and slowly dispersed in their course. After his discovery of the true source of the gravitational effects of nuclear explosions, Goldschmidt's theory about the formation of the solar wind was accepted by other astronomers and cosmologists, and is still known today as Goldschmidt's hypothesis. His law was proved experimentally by Ivan Sutherland and colleagues, and in 1995 University of California, Los Angeles, physicist William Coleman Theodor Koch credited him with one of the first predictions of the cosmic microwave background radiation.  
 Goldschmidt died at his home in Heidelberg.

 Gubel is considered to be the greatest of all pure functional algebras. He was the first to suggest the existence of `` non-atomeals '', i.e., non-decidable topological extensions to sets with spaces of nonzero numbers, as well as the existence of prime sub-sets of the product of modulo and associativity in odd-dimensional spaces.  
 In 1961, he co-authored with Theodore Boak with K. Vassiliev with `` Functions of a Different Algebraic Type '', a series of nine papers on an enumeration language ( the H-1 theorem ) that introduced the concept of permutations and permutation classes. He also contributed papers on algebraic topology, set theory, topological unification, determinants and independence, p-adic numbers, discontinuities, generalized abelian numbers, geometry, the theory of cohomology, and the geometry of sums.  
 Gubel was the founder and first editor of Algebraic Statistics ( eBASE ), and was the father of mathematician-geometricians Elena Efimov and Hans Gubel.

 = Wilbur Rutherford =  
Wilbur Rutherford ( 1854–1921 ) was an American crystallographer and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Rutherford was born in Salem, New Hampshire. In 1888, he attended The New York Academy of Sciences in New York City and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree there in 1894. He was a student of Professor Samuel Bell ( 1825–1888 ), who was working on his education at the Academy when he became interested in crystallography. Rutherford decided to study law, but he returned to his undergraduate studies at the Academy to complete the degree requirements. After graduating with a BA degree in 1897, Rutherford worked for thirty years as an assistant to Professor Edmond Lee Kinch, a crystallographer and illustrator for the NY Academy. In 1917, he became an instructor and one of the founding faculty members of the Department of Crystallography at Columbia University.After retiring in 1936, Rutherford continued to give lectures and was a member of the Division of Crystal Genetics at Harvard University until his death in 1921. He received the Agnes E. Hasse Memorial Medal from the American Society of Crystallography.  
   
   
 == Theology ==  
 Rutherford's chief interest was in the Christian God and Old Testament revelation. Although he considered himself primarily a Biblical scholar and a personal friend of S. F. Rinehart, who was Rutherford's classmate in Columbia, Rutherford's theology was shaped by a lifelong study of deism and was influenced by Aristotelian philosophy. He explored and produced the theosophical groupings and monistic dimensions in his contributions to the deistic group. His first book was Deism in America. He became a member of the Carl E. Schmitt Academy of Religion in Boston in 1915, and a member of the New York Academy in 1924. Rutherford married Sarah Jane Donlan in 1893.

 = Jan Meyers =  
Jan Meyers ( February 11, 1921 – February 10, 2006 ) was an American ethnomusicologist. He was co-founder of the Australian Ethnomusicological Society.  
 Meyers studied with Herbert R. Mark and Phillip Politzer. He is best known for his contribution to ethnomusicology, the study of folk music. He spent the majority of his career as a vocal pedagogue, developing the `` musical repertoire '' ( his terms ) as the basic vehicle to assemble musicians in accord with indigenous cultural roles. By the late 1950s Meyers had amassed a great array of non-Western music sources, each of which has since been classified as an ethnographic artifact. His field studies revealed the diversity of music he was encountering, and included several genuises of indigenous culture that he took to radio to the public. These include the pothibe Kwayi, the Japanese chakot ( first peoples ), the Haida ( later homo sapiens ), and the Chinook ( later humans ). It is primarily his collections of oral traditions of ethnographic and musical contexts that are the major source of evidence for ethnocentricity in all the peoples and groups for whom he is best known.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in 1913 in Lexington, Virginia, Meyers grew up in Tennessee where he was a part of a prominent Christian church. Meyers attended Mount Lebanon High School, starting at the top of his class in 1951. In 1953, at the age of 14, Meyers became a member of the second section of the Lutheran Church in America. After reading C. J. Pournelle's books, he read Dorothy Schuster's The Harvest. Meyers was a first year student at Concordia College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1958. In the Spring of 1959 Meyers received his B.A. and M.A. in English Literature from Concordia College. The same year, Meyers moved to Eugene, Oregon where he worked as a youth pastor. In 1960, after several years teaching pre-kindergarten through graduate school at Oregon State University, Meyers earned a teaching assistant position with the North Shore Conference of Christian Youth in Eugene, Oregon. Meyers also completed his first teaching gig at Southern Oregon Academy, during which time he also began his scholarly and ethnographic studies.  
 Meyers began to pick up his first specimens of these diverse and unco-ordinated cultural collections when he was 14 years old. He carried the material into work as a teacher, and began collecting on his own. One of his first books was `` The Passing of the Rose Woman '' ( 1978 ). This collection was purchased in November of 1978 by the Seattle Folklore Society in collaboration with him and Herbert Meyers. In 1977, he joined the Oregon Ethnological Society. In 1980, he was invited to serve on the advisory board of the Ethnographic Society of Washington and In 1981 he received a chair at Seattle University of the Pacific. In 1982, he received the journal `` Folklore '' from the Ethnographic Society of Washington. He soon formed a cultural exchange program at the Seattle Urban Ethnographic Laboratory and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra.  
 Meyers was a Professor of English Literature and Anthropology at the University of Oregon and Ethnography Professor at the University of Washington, which allowed him to travel in the world. Meyers was particularly interested in the ethnomusicological corpus of people on his travels and developed an ethical approach to his field. In 1973 he received the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship for his studies on Indigenous Australian music.  
 Meyers retired from his position as lecturer and academic director of the Anthropology Department at the University of Oregon in 1988. His final assignment was to produce a popular book on songbirds. Meyers designed a curriculum that supported students from year to year, which contained the `` instrument-object duality '' of songbirds, making `` a working tool and experimentation tool '' that allowed students to be well prepared for `` a live-in. very lively and adventurous listening experience. '' In 1996, Meyers accepted a post as vice-president of the Institute of the North Pacific at Western Oregon University.

Thomas Gerard Todd ( 7 August 1631 – 16 August 1705 ) was an English theologian, chaplain, and translator of the Bible into Latin.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Todd was the son of Dr. Thomas Gerard Todd ( 1st Duke of Burgundy ) and his wife Janet. His father, aged 36, was brought up in Dalrymple House, and was canon to St. Paul's Cathedral. He was baptised at Horsham. He attended his father's father-in-law's collation at the Collegiate Institute, Cambridge, from 1665 to 1668, as translator of the Psalms into Latin ( worked under Rev. Richard Ward ), and studied under Francis Barbadier on divinity under John Ellis, afterwards manager of the Grammar School in Berkeley.  
 On 17 September 1670 he was appointed chaplain of St Peter's Church, Cambridge, and continued his duties there for five years. He lived at St Paul's Chapel, under Sir William Petty ; he began preaching in November 1677, but was still unable to obtain the esteem of his chaplain and successor, by the time of his conversion.  
   
 In 1682 the court of Ingolstadt fell into a bad state of disorder, and the royalists suffered a great loss, having expelled King Ferdinand of Austria and his guests from the capital.Todd was selected as guardian to the Duchess of Baudry ; he was transferred on 9 February 1683 from the monastery to Berkeley, and took the occasion of his high decorations to answer a petition to ordain `` an instructor for the office of ministrant in the churches of the so-called party of high treason '', requesting a special commission for the maintenance of the indigent, for the revival of ancient confessions, and to assist the peasants, and a passage was made for him.  
 The appointment of Thomas Gerard Todd was approved, and two dukes of Burgundy presented him to succeed him, Sir Christopher Wyke, the heir presumptive, and the next November Todd became moderator of the English East India Company. In the same year his brother William Todd, his cousin, was also summoned and a commission was obtained for him. In September 1688 he was appointed a chaplain, and so prosperous was he that he never applied for a commission again. The council of the Church of England of London considered a commission for him, and on 15 March 1689 he was created patron to William Hutton, 2nd Baron Hutton.At the fall of Charles I in 1689 Todd was summoned to Newington Hall.  
 He received his degree of B.D., on 16 June 1690.  
 After the death of his father he died on 16 August 1705, aged 64, in Loughborough, as was the custom of the time.

Nathaniel George Sharpe ( April 21, 1809 – April 3, 1884 ) was an American zoologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Sharpe was born in Niles, Ohio. He graduated from Columbiana Normal College in 1823 and became secretary of the Michigan Academy of Sciences in 1832. From 1834 to 1837, Sharpe was professor of natural history at Indiana University. In 1838, he was appointed a member of the Ohio Geological Survey, and was curator of the Ohio museum, building on the work of John F. Surratt. Sharpe received his PhD in natural history from the University of Chicago in 1840. After retirement in 1845, he made a tour of Europe, Australia, and South America in order to study the animals of the Pacific Islands. He returned to America in 1852 and continued to study fish biology until his death. He was the father of three children : Willard ( 1844–1905 ), Mary Augusta ( 1846–1893 ), and Cyrus F. Sharpe ( 1853–1940 ).  
 Sharpe's work is influenced by entomology. His knowledge of the different types of fish collected in the different Pacific islands, he carefully described them and published notes on them in the early 1840s. He suggested the rather extravagant, if expedient, use of the term `` lobe-finned fish '' to describe lobed fish, and to distinguish the false-water fish from the true-water species. The world's first land cod, the cod pouta ( Codus feniocephalae ), was named after him. His descriptions of the New England Lobsters ( Gastropodenia florida ) and Papillomamys variabilis ( Sostophyllum scaliber ) are also well known.Sharpe's work is a scholarly classic. Many of his papers are collected in The Lobsters of the United States and Canada. It is a significant milestone in the formation of new marine and terrestrial taxa, and is recognized as one of the classics of its time.Sharpe was the author of a number of books, including :  
   
 The Diseases of Shellfish ( 1838 )  
 Remarks on the Nomenclature and Physiology of some Fresh-Water Insects ( 1848 )  
 New Names of Certain Diseases of Fish ( 1860 )

 = James T. Thomas =  
James Terrell Thomas ( January 26, 1842 – February 22, 1928 ) was an American educator and educational theorist who was a member of the British political parties of the mid-20th century.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Born in Milwaukee, Thomas was educated at the famed University of Wisconsin, with a dissertation on the history of seminary education. He then studied mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining a doctorate in 1877 with a dissertation entitled `` On a Demonstration of the Symmetrical Relations of Time and Progress in Education. '' After a career at the University of Pennsylvania he taught at a girls high school. He married Tawnya Eberlein in 1883 and settled in Newport, Rhode Island, where he wrote a textbook, Introduction to Geometry, which was widely used for the next generation of geography teachers.After his success as a teacher, Thomas became a student of John Dewey in Chicago, and later moved to Pasadena, California, to work for George Morton Garvin. He also joined the Socialist Party, an organization founded in 1892, and served for a time as its chairman in Chicago. He served on the editorial board of the academic journal Progress.  
 In 1897 he was elected to the California State Board of Education, serving three terms, ultimately in 1910 and 1910–12. After being re-elected in 1912, he returned to academia to teach mathematics and history, working for the University of California at Berkeley for 30 years until his death.  
   
   
 == World War I ==  
 In 1914, Thomas was appointed principal of Pasadena High School in Pasadena, California, a position he held until his death in 1928.  
   
   
 == United States Senate ==  
 Thomas was a member of both the Social Democratic Party of America and the Union Republicans. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1914 to 1920, and in the United States Senate from 1920 to 1929. He was considered a moderate by the Social Democrats, but the legislature defeated any provision of his Social Security Law of 1914, which would have expanded government benefits for older Americans.  
 Thomas helped develop the UC Berkeley Statistical Society, and served as its president from 1921 to 1924.  
   
   
 == C.G.S. membership ==  
 Thomas was a longtime United States Senator from California, and was one of its most prominent sponsors. In 1920, he sponsored a bill to permit California voters to choose two state parties for each district, one representing the interests of the working-class population while the other representing the interests of the wealthy and elite. The California measure failed on the California State Senate floor in 1924.

 = Oded Hermani =  
Oded Hermani ( Hebrew : הסיונסיו‎ ; Hebrew : כדדוור נוחדר‎ ; December 5, 1924 – October 2, 2002 ) was a Tel Aviv University professor of analytical physics and the author of many books.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Oded Hermani was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, the son of Israeli physician Yakir Hermani, and Israelsan Themelin. He was the son of a chiropractor, Ali Helmut Hermani, and a Frenchwoman, Paula Seeff Mayer. He graduated from the University of Haifa in 1956, where he majored in physics.  
 In the early 1960s he became involved with the newly founded but then far-left politics and publishing group, Shai Yavnez, which was very loosely affiliated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He joined the Society for Industrial and Social Change, which he joined in 1967. In the 1970s and 1980s, Hermani influenced Israel's politics, writing for Yedioth Ahronoth, the left-wing daily newspaper. He also helped establish the ultra-orthodox religious group, Kibbutz Mordechai and was a supporter of the party and its leaders, Golda Meir and David Ben-Gurion.  
 In 1977, he became Professor of the Anatomy of Biological Systems at the University of Haifa, succeeding Omar Aydi. He was the chairman of the department of physics and was also a member of various Israeli academic societies.  
 In the 1980s, as a critic of policies of the then Israeli government, in his famous article `` The destruction of the Palestinian Left '', published in the Talmud, Hermani declared that his goal was to reduce the autonomy and cultural and ideological inferiority of Palestinians, in order to reform the Palestinian nation. In Israel, he formed the faction, People's Power, which had strong anti-Zionist and pro-Palestinian appeals. In 2004, the group received an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa. A second international award, first given in 1985, was in 2007 to honor Oded Hermani, who was at the time a member of the International Society of Nuclear Medicine and with a PhD in theoretical physics, and was awarded the Dr. Harvester Medal of the Nuclear Medicine Association in recognition of his work in the field of molecular physics.  
 In April 2009, his daughter, Ze'ev Hermani-Dan, began working at the University of Tel Aviv as an instructor of the campus's theoretical physics department and a founding member of the PPS, now known as Tel Aviv Polytechnic Institute of Technology.

 = Howard Dyer =  
Howard Dyer ( 13 January 1899 – 6 July 1989 ) was an English-born Australian missionary, social worker and botanist. He was known for his advocacy of the liberation of women and children from slavery and sexual slavery.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Howard Dyer was born in Dudley, Greater Manchester on 13 January 1899 to Sarah Jane Dyer ( died 28 September 1986 ) and William Arthur David Dyer, a surgeon. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School. In 1928, he began working as an assistant to John Theosophical, a leader of the Americanos, the Methodist movement. In 1937, at the age of 22, he became the first man to complete the English Ministry of Liberia, but he was soon released by the British on the grounds that he had failed the Land Rehabilitation Act of 1938.As a missionary, Dyer worked on sex slave patrols in South Africa and Liberia. He also provided medical aid to Pieter Marie Lundby. In 1937, Dyer became co-author of A Sentence on the Emancipation of Slaves in Liberia ( Freedoms Press, 1948 ), which gained widespread acclaim and exposure, and was translated into 19 other languages. He served as Secretary for Uganda from 1939 to 1946. He first visited Liberia in 1935, when a British consular official arrived on the island to collect evidence of slave owners, but after this he spent almost five years working on the conversion of slaves in the country. He was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1945 and the Order of Malta in 1948.Dyer and William Smith acted as translators for the book's subsequent English edition. He was also the editor of a booklet in 1949 on Lusaka, a city in northern Uganda. It was based on a paper written by Mary McKeague Yeats.Dyer died in a searing car crash in 1989 in a medical facility in Sydney, Australia.  
   
   
 == Views on child marriage ==  
   
 Dyer wrote A Sentence on the Emancipation of Slaves in Liberia ( Freedoms Press, 1948 ). Dyer acknowledged that, because of the Great Depression, widespread child marriage was in fact common, but argued that among the population at large child marriage was unusual. He believed that the best way to end child marriage was through the government-funded Birth Control Funds.Dyer advocated the `` liberation of women from slavery and sexual slavery '', as well as `` free education and free health care for all '', using child marriage as a means to achieve these goals.He opposed the compulsory sterilization of children, and argued that the unethical practice was morally damaging. In 1948 Dyer was quoted as saying : `` … there was never any doubt that women were slaves to men, that they were tools whose use it was their own. 'Equal pay for equal work '... can never apply to women and children. I want to raise the old age of consent for the U.S. to eight. I want to raise the age of consent for the 50 states to at least sixteen. '' Dyer believed that child marriage violated human rights and `` is, by definition, unnatural and not to be tolerated.

 = Vilfredo Pareto =  
Vilfredo Pareto ( April 21, 1875 in Piacenza – February 15, 1960 ) was an Italian biologist. He is best known for his comparative studies of the process of evolution. His work in biology developed from his own collection of material, to the works of these men,. In particular, he showed that mutations in the algal species of lambda-antorals, permethrin, neutrophil, pectin and striata, which he had previously described in his own right,, were also responsible for their respective innovations in the algal kingdom. These substitutions resulted in the formation of new groups and phyla. An example of this was the heterotrophic genera Liolaemus and Liolaemorpha. Subsequent species of stellate alga were also called by Pareto : Sparta or Spatholite, Colegio, Canaria and Spati.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Pareto was born in Piacenza, Italy, the son of a member of the Piacenza Chamber of Commerce. He then studied at the Ecole de France and University of Padua, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1885. During the first years of his professional career he devoted much time to the publication of scientific articles in the field of his specialty, evolution, for which he became professor at Padua University in 1887. In addition to his scientific contributions to this specialty, Pareto served as an administrator at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rome, as well as being rector of that institution. He was also responsible for the prefect of the Pontifical Athenaeum, of which he served as president until his death.  
 His works in biology were wide-ranging : he published a vast series of works on the herpetology of Italy, and on the taxonomy of the bryozoans, in 1887–1890, and in 1897–1902 published a book on coral evolution. In addition to his work on evolution, Pareto made several contributions to the field of paleobiology and described a number of new genera and species of insect, such as the bryozoans Proseta and Sesi, and the stellate Hyphlaena. Pareto's contribution to the genus Helix was no less important than his study of the relative numbers and forms of the several species in that genus.  
 Pareto died in Piacenza, Italy.

Mariano Gazzaniga ( October 24, 1881 – January 8, 1966 ) was an Italian scientist and politician, founder of the Sociologia Cimentale di Evoluzione cimentale dei Campini. He was in charge of the national science association of Italian students in Monterey from 1940 to 1943.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Gazzaniga was born in Ferrara in 1881. His family was devout Roman Catholics. His father, Antonello Gazzaniga, had a brother named Paolo Gazzaniga. He studied chemistry at the university of Ferrara, in 1904 and in 1910 graduated with a degree in botany. He later went to university in Rome, where he met Patricio Colombo and Marcello Ippolito.Gazzaniga earned his doctorate in physics under the direction of Prof. Carlo Gide in Alcalá. Gide was the author of several books on theoretical physics and has been credited with the development of the concept of the Higgs boson.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In the course of his career, he participated in numerous physical science experiments of which several papers were submitted to the prestigious Italian scientific journal Nature. In 1918, he wrote a paper with a colleague, in which they presented the results of a hydrostatic experimental mission to the Casimir Sphere at Hertz. This was followed by the discovery of what became known as the `` Echelon of Gattini Crater '' in 1929. He was one of the founders of the Sociologia Cimentale di Evoluzione cimentale dei Campini and later Chair of Sociology at the city of Monterey.  
 In 1940, Gazzaniga became Chief of the Department of Electricity, Gas and Industry, of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. He succeeded Ernesto Gatti, another classic Italian scientist, in the President of the Royal College of Science in Rome, succeeding as president in 1942. During his tenure, the power in Monterey was significantly decreased, since most students of the city were not interested in modern technology. In addition, Gazzaniga attempted to introduce a politically correct curriculum for physics, changing it to Pernilism.  
   
   
 == Scientific contributions ==  
 Gazzaniga is considered as the founder of `` modern physics '' in Italy. He defined the new phenomenon of superfluidity as follows :  
... the chemical formula of a superfluid liquid or gas, and is applied to the superfluid gas at lower temperatures, just as to a gas of flame.  
 Gazzaniga formulated this property through the chemical properties of non-equilibrium fluids. In later years he was able to prove the existence of metallic fissures with electrons similar to those present in metals. He also used the term sub-fluidity. In 1894, he introduced to Italian scientific literature the knowledge of a rare isotope of uranium that had been discovered in 1902 by Casimir Platon, showing that metals are not solid. He also co-authored the text Triumvirate ( Trio ) with Aldo Cadmium. Gazzaniga died in Monterey in 1966.

 = Hans Siegfried Barnhart =  
Hans Siegfried Barnhart ( 26 September 1833 in Wimpole – 16 May 1901 in Salzburg ) was a German theologian. He was a professor at the University of Salzburg from 1874 to 1878. He was especially associated with the knowledge of Deuteronomy and the New Testament. He authored a Hebrew edition of the Old Testament.  
 Barnhart was one of the first important theological commentators in the field of Neo-Lutheranism, which he considered more established than modern Protestantism.Barnhart's name is associated with the more popular episcopate of Christian Calvinists. This denomination was founded in 1792 by his fellow Lutheran theologian Ernst Gröttl. In this church and sect the episcopal see was the only one of its kind in the whole of Germany.The Anglican Bishop of Mainz, Tobias Schopenhauer, gave Barnhart the care of his Second Visit in 1849. This consisted of three years and a half and involved four churches in Mainz, two of them in Heidelberg, and seven months in England. He undertook, among other things, the preparation of an edition of the Gospels in Latin and English. He was accompanied by a lecturer on Deuteronomy, a book on the works of St. Paul, a translation of St. James, a work on the Gospels in the New Testament and a treatise on the New Testament of Paul.  
 The Bishop of Mainz had, after his father's death, inherited the family home and spare time. The reason for Barnhart's exertions, was that no attention had been paid to this naturalization law since 1840, but a law so recently forgotten was still being enforced. In 1870 the whole family moved to Hamburg, where they lodged for a year. Two years later the New Jerusalem synagogue was organized. Barnhart studied theology at the University of Tübingen, in 1876 he received his licentiate ( doctorate ) in philosophy, being ordained the same year. His ordination showed that he was one of the few authors of intellectual writing in Germany that made an effort to reconcile the religious and social outlook of the 19th century.

 Liebenfeste was born in Amsterdam, the son of the town pastor, Hendrik Schultze. He studied classical philology and humanities, initially at the Polytechnic School in Pietermaritzburg, and later at the Otto William IV University in Ghent, Belgium, where he graduated as a docent in 1802.His work as a professional engraver can be seen in the engravings which characterized the borders of his unfinished cantonments in Belgium, such as the Veneto and the Edo in the former. For more than fifty years he was employed in the engraving and designing of royal currency for the Dutch East India Company. One of the master engravers of the Lippincott & Co., Great Britain, and other companies, he died in London.Liebenfeste was a founding member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He taught at the Royal Academy of Engineering in Hertfordshire, British Columbia, and created a number of significant works of art, including these, the De Jure Cruste ( 1803 ), and the Petit Ballad, based on the Bible : A Translation, Assemble at Flour, 1807.

William Edward Robinson ( 13 February 1795 – 3 April 1871 ) was a British botanist, known for establishing the Botanical Museum of the University of London.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Robinson was born in 1804 at Crawfords Colchester, Surrey. He was a descendant of the family of Lieutenant-Governor William Robinson, who was the founder of the botanic garden at Trelawny, south Wales. The two brothers in Robinson's ancestry, Jonathan and Benjamin William, were botanists and agricultural explorers who settled in London. Robinson went to Guildford, Essex, in 1817 to attend Lyell Grammar School, but took up the study of botany at the University of Oxford.  
 In 1822, he was appointed assistant in the garden of Trinity College, Oxford, and with Thomas Stafford died in 1833. In 1833 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. His work on the root system of certain plant species inspired a description by Dr. Huxley of the spicelia Neroliopsis opercularis in 1836, and in the same year became one of the first subscribers to New Naturalist ( now Puffin ) magazine.  
 He died at Whittington Hall, near Grove Hall, London.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 William was especially interested in the Alpine plants. In 1834, while living at Trelawny he published “ An Account of some Recent Wanderings from the Dolomites to the Kew Gardens, London, by a Young Officer in the Royal Artillery, under Mr. Joseph Billi, Major of Brigade 22 ( Officers'Royal Artillery, Light Artillery ), whilst in the French River on patrol, out of the view of the French Government and many other high gentlemen who know not how to deal with a scientist like myself who can not speak French '' ( i.e., Bagnall-Mansfield's The Danubian Alps ). He also wrote :  
   
 `` The butterfly ’ s most important scapeclets are found in France, in large part due to the irregular crossing of the Gulf of Cambrai from the west to the north, so as to form the often extinct Seine. Both the latter, as well as the fall of the Alps in the course of the battle, produced a terror on those parts where those crags are already seen, and consequently on the inhabitants of a coastal district, so that it was almost impossible for the soldiers who crossed them to get home, or to repose... An Army of the Napoleonic Directory should explore the almost endless Riesenschaffen of France, with as much delight and research as I shall. `` He also wrote on the Botanical Garden at Trelawny :  
   
 `` Some inquiries are worthy of notice in connection with that garden at Trelawny, and relate to the possession and cultivation of various plants, on a large scale, and in large numbers. The quantities of plants. `` In 1838 Robinson wrote :  
 `` I am now in my seventies, and am thinking of a comparative system of botany, together with a description of some new species of mushrooms ; and in passing, I shall interpose some curious remarks respecting the law of conformation of the boundaries between plants, as applied to tropical diseases, which is expressed in ‘ Paternal decomposition ’ of the plants. As a curious conjecture I give ‘ interposition ’ of species at the partition of a plant into regular torsion plates ; and may the author of ‘ The Real English Stork ’ use ’ the same phrase for the American spiny stringfoot. It is probable, also, that ‘ New Jamaican '' which I do not recall seeing, is the same species as a species of New Zealand mygalomorph ( Schulina sive Beninger ) ; and this idea is supported by Dr. Ruse ’ s trip to the Pitcairn Islands in 1832, and by Dr. Charles Curzon's account in the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1799, ‘ Entomology ; or, an Enquiry into the Origin of Insects, and their Evidences, ’ and by the Eponymous Annals of Linnaeus. ’

 = Alan Trevelyan =  
Alan Dyer Trevelyan ( 18 June 1871 – 14 July 1947 ) was an Australian experimental physicist, inventor, inventor, and cartographer.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Alan Dyer Trevelyan was born in New Zealand. He was the son of eminent chemist Joseph Dyer Trevelyan and Agnes Winthrop Trevelyan. After winning a scholarship to a Hunter College medical college in 1880, he studied with William Henry Ewart Gladstone and William Jones from 1880 to 1884. While a student he built a gas-tight cupola with magnesium sintered glass. He continued working for Gladstone as a consultant and boarder. During World War I he helped build a turbine engine using a slightly different design. He continued to work with Gladstone and Ewart Gladstone until 1922. As a researcher he was the associate director of the San Diego ( California ) Division of Electricity and Power Engineering at the time of his death.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
   
 Dyer Trevelyan designed and built an electrostatic discharge oscillator to use to make magnetic needles for magneto-optical circuits, thereby making electrical dynamo based. He was also the inventor of the `` telegraph system ''. The telegraph system had no transmitting wires, but the telegraph pencil had separate lines that could be written on when the information was on a sheet of paper. Dyer Trevelyan's telegraph line had. The pencil began to communicate with the wire, thus instantly connecting the lines, and then connected the wires. With the telegraph line, all that was needed to transmit was to note the lines on the paper.

 = Henry Amadeus Webb (astronomer) =  
Henry Joseph Webb, CBE ( 11 January 1758 – 11 March 1857 ), was a British astronomer.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was the youngest son of Henry Webb, President of the University of Cambridge, and his wife, Caroline Elizabeth Compton Webb. He was educated at Goldsmiths College, Cambridge from where he matriculated in 1800 and graduated as 2nd wrangler in the class of 1796. He then entered the Royal Astronomical Society as an assistant to Johann Baptist Brondel. In 1811, aged 22, he was appointed on the staff of the Royal Greenwich Observatory as assistant to Professor Winder, a fellow amateur astronomer.Winder's observations of the comet 1812 were made by Webb, and later by the comet observer William Ruskin. A report by Reynolds and Rydley in 1818 described a shadow cast by the comet, and included the appearance of the comet's tail. A detailed catalogue of the comet was published in 1823, but the activity of the comet during its time was not recorded. A modern comparison of the coma and coma ring shows a similarity in size, density and number of gas rings, although there is a much larger coma ring, the size of which may be more than 10 times the comet's own diameter.  
   
   
 === Kuiper belt ===  
 Webb devised an ingenious method of calculating the distance of the farthest point on the far side of the asteroid Vesta from Earth.Hubble was amongst the early astronomers to discover the hypothetical structure of the giant planet Kuiper Belt, located in the outermost portion of the Kuiper belt.In 1803, Webb saw that a star would not `` rise '' from the lower surface of the planet because it would `` travel '' to the upper hemisphere of the planet, at a speed of more than 23,000 kilometers per second ( 18,099 miles per second ). With this in mind he suggested that the path of the star should be curved to match this speed.He arrived at a calculation of a star's orbital period of 5 years and 36 days, which he presented to the Royal Astronomical Society, based on observations made with the Kepler telescope in 1636. The results were published in a paper of 5 June 1802. On 2 July 1803, Webb was chosen to succeed William Herschel as chairman of the newly founded Royal Astronomical Society.  
 His best known work was on the solar eclipse of 1776, which he observed for the first time on 24 January 1811. He failed to predict the eclipse, and was unaware that Herschel had recently observed an eclipse.He was a member of many scientific societies, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Society of London, the Astronomical Society of London, and the Royal Society of Paris.

Sir Edward Algernon Guilfoyle FRS ( 1 March 1828 – 12 February 1904 ) was an English physician and mycologist, and also one of the founders of basic immunology, developing a methodology of quantitative PCR for histopathology.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Guilfoyle was born at Jackson, York on 1 March 1828 and died at Oakhall, York on 12 February 1904. He was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and later medical school at University College Hospital in London, where he obtained his doctorate in 1900. His interest in inoculation was encouraged by the work of Alexander H. Rockhill and his teaching assistant Andrew Asquith.Guilfoyle joined the Cambridge Research Association ( CRAA ) in 1901 and was a senior fellow in 1898. He was a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London ( CRCP ), of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of the Royal Society of Vienna, and of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.  
 He described the structure and mycology of the staphylococci and the theory of lysis. A list of a number of his publications appears in the W.M.Sc. book Microbiology in 1919 ( Foresman's Monograph ) and in The Mycologist ’ s Dictionary 1927.  
 He established the antibiotics sequence study in 1918 and worked with John Napier Wylie to publish the Manual of Microbiology in 1922.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Guilfoyle worked on the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis, which was an equally important problem of disease control. He was also interested in tuberculosis and was elected a member of the All-Party Commission on Tuberculosis. He was particularly interested in the differentiation of pathogenic myc organisms, which was essential for assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of tuberculosis.His best-known contribution was the theory of lysis, which defined the technique of quantifying the extent of cytological damage to the cytoskeleton and performed the distinction between dermal ( vesicular ) and epidermis mycoplasma ( nerve cells ). In his theory he used the criteria of rhodopsin and the reaction time of mycoplasmas to distinguish particular stages of elimination.  
 Guilfoyle showed that infection of mycoplasma was normal. The treatment of BAPHID ( pneumococcal eye infection ) with hydrogen peroxide is so effective in the treatment of the disease.

Frederick Samuel Patterson ( June 24, 1892 – January 29, 1955 ) was an American engineer, mineralogist, and mining geologist. He worked on a number of mining and gas projects throughout the United States. He was best known for a 1933 study in which he worked as a consultant on development of the Ordovician complex of gold veins in Northern California. He was a professor of geology at the University of Chicago from 1932 to 1941, and for three years from 1943 to 1944 the director of the National Museum of Natural History at Washington, D.C. His wife, Augusta Sutherland Patterson, was a chemist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, the second of six children to Dr. and Mrs. Parris Patterson and Wanda D. Grigson. He was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Dr. and Mrs. Parris Patterson. He was the second of six children. He attended high school in Dayton, graduated from high school in Dayton, graduated from high school in Cincinnati, Ohio, and joined the first company of miners at Payneville Mining Co. of Ohio, where he worked for two years as an apprentice then was transferred to the Indiana Works at Walton. During World War I he served as a casualty aid to the 83rd Ohio Infantry.At the close of the war he enlisted in the armed forces, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Returning to Dayton he married Emma H. B. Cooper, daughter of Charles S. Cooper. He obtained his degree from Indiana University in 1933. He married Eunice Helen E. Agnes Bevan, and they had two children. In 1942 Patterson obtained his D.Sc. from the University of Chicago. He returned to Ohio, where he worked on several mining projects, including one in the Ross Valley.  
   
   
 == Mining and Gas Exploration ==  
   
 During World War I, Patterson began working on a research group on the growth of coal. The Ross Valley area in Central and South Ohio was little known, so he assembled a staff, including William D. Kelley and Pat Burrows, to study the geology of the area. They laid out hundreds of square miles of field equipment. Patterson discovered extensive deposits of olivine and graphite deposits in the basin. He also discovered new ore deposits, including those rich in rare elements such as cerium. The research group went on to study large geological fields in Wyoming and Montana, and in Mexico.While researching geology, the Patterson-Kelley group also attempted to mine ore deposits near an existing coal pipeline. The route went through the Davis, Utah and Clark counties in Northern Arizona and ran through the Bund County towns of Wheat Ridge and Kansas City, Missouri, until it crossed through Snelling County, Missouri, on the Gallatin River in Porter County. There, the group found a new vein of olivine, cerium and bismuth deposits. It is estimated that over 2 million tons of ore ( pure and ore processed ) were produced at least as early as 1911. The paper completed by the Patterson-Kelley team was published in the American Journal of Science and Engineering in 1924. Patterson was one of the first professional engineers to describe the ore deposits, identifying those with its earth tones. Their standard of differentiation is higher quality than what is available today.  
 In a separate study, the Patterson group found a new mine in Northern California, but its geology was much more complicated. The mine, which is known as Diebold Creek, was named Pat Patterson Mine after him.

 Altberg is best known for his contributions to U.S. politics, notably from 1910 to 1920 as a leader of a Republican policy alliance that was defeated by Herbert Hoover in the presidential election of 1920, but served as a catalyst for a rejection of the New Deal's economic liberalism.  
 Born into a Jewish family, he grew up in Europe. Having failed in undergraduate school and passed an entrance exam to Leipzig University, he studied law in Berlin. He became a lawyer before marrying, at the age of 26, Regina Zahn and emigrating to America.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1904 he was hired by New York Times reporter Tom Engelhardt to work for the central bank, serving on the New York State Committee on Agriculture. He started in the legal department at the City & County of New York. From 1909 to 1919 he was the private secretary of U.S. senator Benjamin Zinn and a clerk in the New York Supreme Court. On the eve of the American Civil War, he joined the Union Volunteer Reserve ( U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ). He was employed by the Department of Agriculture, later the Bureau of Redevelopment, during the Reconstruction Administration. In 1921 he became associate editor of The New York Herald-Tribune.  
 In 1923, he married Jane Irene Blaschke, later widow of the distinguished American carpenter and artist Frank Blaschke, with whom he had a daughter and three sons.  
 In 1927 he founded the Institute for Economic Studies at the University of Rochester.  
 In the 1930s, Altberg became a Republican by joining the Republican Policy Committee, serving until 1945. When Hoover was appointed to the presidency of the U.S. in 1930, the leading Republican intellectuals, including Samuel Gompers, began a campaign to dismiss Altberg. He was elected a Republican in 1946 and then did much of his own research for a piece in National Review.  
 In 1947, he was named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the highest distinction granted by the Academy. He served as a senior advisor to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1951 and chairman of the Council on Economic Policy from 1952 to 1953.  
 As such, he was the most important leader of the Republican coalition in the U.S. House of Representatives during his career. Altberg represented the New York City district from 1911 to 1920 until his retirement in 1966. He is credited with important steps in expanding the number of tax cuts in the U.S. in the early post-World War I years, by reducing the top marginal income-tax rate from 100 percent to 28 percent, and with establishing the U.S. bank credit to help companies around the world. He was also one of the major Republican leaders in combating the subject of Argentina's socialist government. He finally left politics in 1957 and died in Basingstoke, England.

Oswald Samuel Landry ( April 17, 1915 – July 31, 1988 ) was an American neuroanatomist. He worked at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and participated in the development of the first brain models, the Landry motor.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Landry graduated from Columbia University in 1941, then joined Harvard Medical School in 1943. He worked on animals as a neuroanatomist before being hired to the California Institute of Technology in 1953. He spent much of the next three decades at the Center for Brain and Behavior, a private facility in Glendale, California, specializing in experimental neuroanatomy. He died in 1988, one year after being appointed chairman of the department of neuroanatomy at the university.One of his earlier accomplishments was discovering and observing the birth defect Diabetes in humans. He also documented thousands of cases of adult blindness and brain damage to rats from Glioblastoma.  
   
   
 == Brain modeling ==  
 In 1971, Landry published the landmark Landry research in human activity. He and colleagues used brain lesions to show that people can rapidly and predictably move their brains into new locations. The first detailed images of the brain showed how different parts of the brain reacted when they were touched in specific locations.  
 The Landry model was described and named for a brain region, called the neocortex, that develops in response to the human body. Neuroscientists Robert Landry, Bruce R. Walter, and Donald J. Landry described Landry's Model in Human Behavior ( first published in 1987 ). The Landry model is a programmable computational model that promotes prediction of behaviors. The goal of the model is to capture every type of behavior by locating the position and amplitude of neuronal events that can induce the behavior in advance.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Landry is recognized for his pioneering work in the experimental neuroanatomy. With the assistance of Joseph L. Schwartz, he wrote and published on the function of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.He contributed to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease.

 = Ferdinand Georg Micheler =  
Ferdinand Georg Micheler ( 22 April 1781 – 18 September 1869 ) was a German chemist, bacteriologist and physiologist, born in Esslingen. Micheler was the first person to report a theory that oxygen can be produced from an alpha acid ( guanine ) in the presence of a calcium ion. Micheler's hypothesis was rejected by more and more of his contemporaries, until Johann Nikolaus Czerny demonstrated that a reaction with carbonic acid ( C 3 H 4 O 5 ) in aqueous solution took place as opposed to the oxidation that he predicted.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Micheler was born in Esslingen on 22 April 1781, the fifth of seven children of August August Micheler, professor of theology in the University of Erlangen, and his wife Charlotte Anna Hagen, née Eubin. His father was an apothecary. Micheler was educated at the University of Strasbourg, and then took up an assistant position at the Botanical Gardens of Dresden, where he became interested in botany and chemistry. In 1804 he became a member of the faculty of philosophy at the University of Erlangen. In 1809 he became a director at the Flechtenbergische Institut der nationalsozialistischen Wissenschaften. During this time he also traveled frequently to Cologne.  
   
   
 == Medical research ==  
 In 1804, Micheler joined a medical research group headed by Dietrich Bonhoeffer. In 1810, Micheler obtained a doctorate in anatomy at the University of Erlangen under the supervision of Paul Robert Freiherr von Holste ( 1821-1864 ). In 1813 Micheler became a full professor of anatomy and physiology. During his early days at Erlangen, Micheler and his brother Nicolai helped with the finances of the Flechtenbergische Institut der nationalsozialistischen Wissenschaften, which opened a new medical school for a general medical faculty in 1816. In 1822, he and Robert Christian Ruediger were appointed as specialists to treat the severely injured in the Flechtenbergische Institut. In 1829 Micheler was appointed head of the Institute. During the 19th century the institute operated as the Carl Fischer Institute for Theoretical Physiology.  
   
   
 == Cancer and esophageal cancer ==  
 On 18 September 1834, Micheler became ill with stomach cancer, which was diagnosed in 1839, but eventually went unrecognized until several years later. The family physician at the Flechtenbergische Institut observed a considerable change in Micheler's behavior. In particular, he had trouble sitting still for extended periods and seemed anxious about his surroundings.  
 Micheler died on 18 September 1869, at the age of fifty-one.

 = William Gerstle =  
William Gerstle ( 13 August 1842 – 19 March 1917 ) was an American geologist and administrator. A distinguished linguist and mathematician, he earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University and subsequently became a career lecturer in geology at the University of Kansas. He was chairman of the faculty of geology at Union College in Columbia, New York, from 1902 to 1910.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 William Gerstle was born on 13 August 1842 in Mecklenburg, Upper Silesia ( today-Poland ), in the Silesian region of the Upper Silesian and Ussuriut ( now Wrocław ) Empire. In 1874, he graduated from high school and started his studies at the university in Mecklenburg. He later worked in the mineralogical department at the technical and governmental institute at the same university, but in 1879 started an investigation at high school about the peculiar formation of old gypsum deposits in Poland and the Upper Silesian region.He was hired by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory ( known today as Livermore National Laboratory ) as an assistant in 1910 and in 1916 became director of the geological surveys of that department. In 1918 he became a career lecturer in geology at Union College in Columbia, New York. In 1923, he became a principal of Union College, and in 1937 became a full professor.  
   
   
 == Scientific activities ==  
 The many scientific papers published during his lifetime contain the results of scientific investigations around the world. Most of the researches by Gerstle were very similar to the one which Walter Curran published during the same period, but with the details being a little different. Gerstle used different methods. As a result, some of the results published after 1923 and only after Gerstle's death have been very unfavorable to Curran and many conclusions have come to confirm it. Gerstle's colleague, Victor Kemeny, did much to inform these negative results, and also to spread the scientific opinions about Gypsum's antiquity through general statements, due to the popularity of scientific research around the world.  
 Gerstle was co-author of Specimen Geology and ( 1903 ) Natural Geology of the Alaskan Arctic. He was co-author of Popular Geology and ( 1904 ) Complete Geology, in collaboration with Dr. George Davis.His investigations are found in his books Beiträge zur Kenntnis der fischen aufschnitte Riespen und gluverschen Ozean. W. Gerstle ( LXXII + 1 ; Stuttgart, 1913 ).

 = Alexander Dubsky =  
Alexander Dubsky ( 18 April 1753 – 11 March 1832 ) was a Russian Russian statesman, mathematician, physicist, writer and scientist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Dubsky was born at Kolmenka. In his youth he studied mathematics and astronomy at Moscow University and at Saint Petersburg Military Academy, obtaining his doctorate at Saint Petersburg in 1774. He was not employed during the Revolution, but afterwards became a lecturer at Saint Petersburg Military Academy. In 1793 he became the first vice-rector of the Institute of the Propagation of Learning. In 1796 he became a member of the International Mathematical Society.  
 During the Revolution, Dubsky was among those who advocated free trade, but lost his seat at the Institute of the Propagation of Learning and was banned for three years from going to Paris and other European capitals. He then returned to Russia, where he became the chairman of the Russian Library in Paris. His work brought him recognition throughout Russia, and during the Russian Revolution he became its deputy to the Imperial Government, which is thought to have favored him and others with the patronage of the Prussian government.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 Dubsky is considered the father of mathematical physics. His main research interest was the relations between two potentials of infinite curvature, V and F, and their vector product with the same degree, M. It has been argued that he wrote the first mathematical treatise on linear equations, a work that is known as Leopold ( 1795 ), which has influenced many modern mathematicians. The solution to the Leopold equation has three solutions : M=2/M, F=1/2, and V=1/4. The author did not assume a uniform distribution of the variables but he allowed for their properties.  
 Dubsky introduced the idea of simultaneous dualities that can be expressed as elementary numbers, analogous to the Dirac integral. The book of Syllogism began this work. Later, Dubsky solved the elliptic curves from 5:2:3 and from 3:2 :2 :4 by starting from 4 and ending from 3. He was not a prolific inventor and did not publish many works.

 As noted in L'école romanistique, the mention of the Hebrew name יהוה לאבודה האמר אשרים ( Maklimas Pachonoboy ) in Russian literature is a complete misspelling. It has now been proven that this manuscript ( 19 July 1794, from Korczak under the influence of Aleksandr Milov ) was not a Librievo manuscript but one of Dubsky's own work.

 He was born in London, the son of Dr William Hooker, Royal College of Surgeons of the South East. His father was also the founder and senior director of the Royal Institution. He attended King's College, Oxford and graduated in 1823. There he worked on chemistry and physiology. He became a resident at King's College, graduating in 1826. While at King's College, Hooker discovered iodine to be useful as an antiseptic in both physical and psychological conditions. In 1827 he moved to the University of Cambridge to work on tuberculin fever. In that year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, a peerage he held for eight years, during which time he also published several important papers on acids and minerals.  
 In 1829, he succeeded John Thomson as librarian at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. A student of James Garnier, he held the post until his death on 16 March 1853.  
 He had lived in Amsterdam from 1775, and became a close friend and associate of Edward Jenner in 1832. He married Thomas Frederica Thomson ( 1797–1853 ), one of his students, on 23 September 1834. They had two children, Margaret and David.

Humphrey Spruce ( May 23, 1887 – March 1, 1958 ) was a British physician and geneticist who became the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg. He demonstrated that recombination between two chromosomes was possible, thus establishing a link between cross-sex chromosomes and normal biology.Spruce was born in Bournemouth, England, and educated at Birkbeck College, London. He obtained his PhD in 1909 from the University of Cambridge, where he lectured on plant physiology. He was awarded the Arnold Owen Prize in 1930, the Edgar B. Evans Prize in 1936, and the Arnold C. Spruce Medal in 1932. The Edward Avery Memorial Medal of the American Society of Plant Pathologists is named in his honor.  
 Spruce later worked in the institute of medical genetics at the British Medical Research Council. He was elected president of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1937. His papers on Japanese measles were published in American journals. He published over 120 scientific papers and received many honors, including the Robert F. Reed Foundation prize.  
 His research mainly focused on the genetics of viruses. He suggested that certain variants of the influenza virus were inherited from several women, but his research of venereal diseases did not establish this. Nevertheless, he was the first person to isolate the genetic structure of a human egg, while others have since verified the basis of this finding.  
 Spruce described 11 different herpesviruses, and it is estimated that he identified 46 million different forms of these viruses. He is remembered as a scientific pioneer because he showed that two of the four `` biological girls '' of the Zaire epidemic of 1918, Sars or West Nile ( two subspecies of the Sars ) were genetically distinct ; however, it was only by isolating the E4 segment of that virus that he was able to establish the exact sequence of its RNA content.

William Morris, FRS FRSE ( December 10, 1894 – October 20, 1961 ) was an English geologist, entomologist, botanist, paleontologist, and prolific essayist.  
 Morris was born at Bishop Auckland, Wiltshire, and educated at Ayrton Academy, South Africa, and the University of Oxford. In 1898 he began to study mineralogy, and was awarded a degree in 1901 for his work on the Kimberley limestone.  
 In 1910, Morris was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1914 he became the president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( serving from 1917 to 1919 ), a position he held until his retirement in 1937. In 1918, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Edinburgh. Morris was involved in the Grubstreet earthquakes of 1921, of which the subduction zone appears to have been the most active, and there was his recommendation for engineering a track to shelter victims. Morris also took an active interest in ecologies of sub-Arctic and sub-Antarctic deposits, and in 1911 was awarded a Government Fellowship of £3000 for the purpose of excavating the sea bed of Headingley. He was appointed a member of the Royal Society in 1925. In the same year he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.During the Second World War, he was assigned to the same level as the botanist John Dodd. His Scottish connections were also found in his friendship with the mining engineer and geologist James Maguire Davis, who married Morris in 1938. Morris'research led to his appointment as a research fellow in paleontology at the University of Melbourne. In this post, he was responsible for identifying fossilized fungal types and selecting the best specimens to be used in the periodical : petrology, paleontology, petrography, and paleontology.  
 In 1963, Morris'work was honored in the anniversary of his father's death by publication of his two-volume Fossil Rhyolites, Ornithology ( 1965, with Jack Bentley ).

Alexandre ( Peter ) Cochetel, a French scholar, anatomist and historian of medicine, is regarded as one of the most important French Anatomists of the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early years ===  
   
 Pierre Méchain was born in Paris on 16 September 1805, at the 7th arrondissement. In 1828, a graduation from the medical school at the Cours Pompidou was postponed for five years due to illness. At age 15, he was engaged as medical inspector in the Paris Commune during the suppression of the uprising. He then attended the Académie des Sciences and in 1832 graduated as M.D. He then joined the faculty at the Saint-Malo Hospital in Lyon, where he worked under Thomas Clozer, also of the Lyon Académie, after Clozer had resigned as a doctor at the same hospital to devote himself to the investigation of infectious diseases.  
   
   
 === Academic career ===  
 In 1840, Cochetel became involved in the activities of the Académie des Sciences. He accompanied Clozer on a research trip in association with Pierre André Blon in the Adriatic Sea. In 1842, the Académie named him a member of the Academy for his discovery of the cause of the dead body odor in sheep. He is also best known for his work on the fecundation, analysis and treatment of parasitic diseases ( schistosomiasis and necropsies ). From 1846 to 1849, he worked with Jacques Duprot on the poor treatment of patients with leprosy. In 1852, the term `` cocaine '' was introduced to describe his patients'cravings, in lieu of morphine as their addiction drug. He later applied this term to cases of chronic parasites with an association with hepatitis ( the fungoid causes liver disease ) and rabies ( deadly cholera ). Cochetel also wrote a treatise on the treatment of diabetic patients. In 1854, he participated in the travel round Switzerland to record new findings in neuro-pathology. In 1855, he became lecturer in Anatomy and in 1857, in medicine, following a temporary interruption by the first cessation of his medical studies. His dissertation, On the middle palate and its location, was written with a view to elucidate its function. As a medical educator, he wrote a textbook on pathology, coining the terms sensory and neurosis and moving from `` tissue and nerve '' to `` muscles and fluid ''. In 1859, he and Paul Maria Cervantes discovered a pathology of Lepidopteus genitalis.In 1866, Cochetel moved to Haute-Saône, a suburb of Paris, where he worked on his work on other micro-organisms, e.g., on the fusarium from Salk in the former Empire. At the same time, he published a map on diseases in France and its geographical distribution. His contributions were financed by donations from family and friends in France.  
   
   
 === Marriages and divorces ===  
 The future Cardinal-Priest Charles-Louis was married to Sir Elisabeth Théoël-Chazan, and in 1854, the former married Cochetel. Cochetel acted as the archbishop of Périgord, a position that he held from 1867 to 1873. He served as canon and deacon of Saint-Louis de la Pârault until he died. He married his second wife at age 72.  
   
   
 === Death ===  
 After retiring from teaching, he became an emeritus professor of Anatomy at the École Polytechnique. In 1876, he again became a lecturer on pathology at the École Polytechnique, this time at the Diziers et Oise, he had retired from teaching in 1857. He died at the age of 87. His grave lies in the cemetery of Montpellier.

In the absence of any reliable record, Brúníkr Dolíks is supposed to have been a businessman in some sort, or to have settled in Nord-Peléš near St. Moritz.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Brúníkr Dolíks was born in Kazan. He graduated in law in 1901 and was a lawyer until 1931.  
 In 1930, Brúníkr Dolíks participated in the 1947 Lavra crisis. He was investigated by an investigation team led by Prof. Jiráš Kotzebue as the perpetrator. He was arrested under a European arrest warrant, since Prague was not part of the Annex to the UN Convention against Torture ( 1977 ) and the author of the statement was not at home on the night of the arrest. Brúníkr Dolíks was tried by the Soviet Special Tribunal of Soviet Judicature and sentenced to 12 years in a Special Security Clinic. The case was sent to the International Court of Justice in The Hague on June 29, 1980, where the appeals were abandoned. This decision came after a six-year legal battle. On June 27, 1995, the presiding Judge, Ann Arbor Owen, issued an order and the case was tried again, but it was rescheduled for December 14, 1997.  
 In March 2003, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Czechoslovakia officially stated that the arrest warrant and conviction were either valid or not valid. According to a country spokesman, now 25 years, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Czech Republic `` has no direct proof '' that Brúníkr Dolíks committed any crimes during the Lavra crisis, `` but we are pleased that he finally faced justice ''. It is still possible that the case is still open.In December 2009, the International Supreme Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the most severe punishment was not sufficiently justified, with the exact details stating that he had failed to disclose enough information to the investigator to classify as a traitor. Since Brúníkr Dolibor's death, several further prosecution and trial cases are still pending.

 = Alexander Kraig =  
Alexander Kraig ( Russian : Алекса́ндр Мари́й Ива́н ; August 7, 1906 – July 28, 1998 ) was a Soviet metallurgist and cosmologist born in Saint Petersburg. He invented the so-called K-matrix or fast magnetron for the Tevatron, which later became the neutron spectrometer of the USSR. He has also been known for the invention of the K-nuclei, a group of nuclei in the proton with its helical three-dimensional structure.Kraig was a professor at the Physical Physics Department of Moscow State University, his nephew, which became the Institute for Near-Infrared Studies, where he worked under Valentin Chernofeev.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Kraig was the son of Alexander and Ella ( mother Gizinevna ) Kraig and first got his education in the 1920s in Nizhny Novgorod. Afterwards, he completed several teaching positions in Nizhny Novgorod and Saint Petersburg State University. After finishing his educational course at the Nizhny Novgorod State University, in 1927 Kraig began to take advanced classes at the University of Moscow ( two Ph.D. and one doc. diss. students ). In 1929 he began teaching physics at the Moscow State University, under Stalin. In 1939 he was promoted to full professor, becoming the director of the department of applied physics. In 1947 he became the chairman of the Mathematics Department of the Moscow State University.  
 In the early 1950s Kraig also began to research in axial torsion, applied matrices, elastic scattering and even the lattice field theory of crystals. His research led to the development of the ultrashort-width laser matrix and also enhanced the production of thin films by means of an extended nuclear crystal ( a so-called vortex blockade ). The model formed in 1952 is the blueprint used for the K-nuclei used in many today's modern spectroscopes and the so-called energy hysteresis rhopalo.Kraig was a member of the Institute of Near-Infrared Studies ( IRIOS ) of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labor in 1955. He received the Physicist Medal in 1958 and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1960.  
 In the 1960s and 1970s, Kraig did research at the Institute for Near-Infrared Studies in the Leningrad meteorological facility. From 1984 to 1987, Kraig was the head of the Department of Applied Physics of Moscow State University, which produced the renowned K-nuclei and became the leading institute in the country in physics and metallurgy.Kraig joined the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1963 as a scientific officer and in 1973 was named a member of the Peasant's Party of the USSR. On the recommendation of Yuri Andreev, he was elected to the Soviet Academy of Sciences in the 1980s.Kraig was one of the first to apply superconductivity to thermal treatment of matter. He was a founder and the head of the research group for superconductivity and an early contributor to the development of the WPC ( wire thin-film method ).

He stayed on at Harvard for his final year, graduating with a M.A. in mathematics in 1913.  
 Warren joined General Electric in 1917 and became chief engineer in 1923. In the late 1920s he became a major figure in the developing field of crystal theory, with an early contribution to the field of subharmonic theory. In the 1930s he pursued large-scale magnetic surfaces with as-yet-unproven evidence of dislocations in the crystals they sit on. In 1932 he proposed a framework for classifying crystals based on surface properties. Warren, along with John Asphale and Samuel Bushnell, coined the terms `` magnetic lattice '' and `` antiferromagnetism ''.  
 Warren died in Boston, Massachusetts in 1942.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 Warren attended the High School for gifted children of Charles T. Foster in Lexington, Massachusetts, and graduated from King's College London in 1904.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 In 1912 he joined the Harvard group investigating the interplay of physics and chemistry under Dr. Carl Van Vechten. There Warren began to use a statistical model to measure what happens to crystals with magnetic fields. In 1913 he developed and published a method of classifying crystals based on surface properties, which ultimately led to a mathematical theory known as the Warren-von-Neumann theory. He first proposed a subharmonic theory of the ferromagnetism of ferroelectric crystals in 1931. The model is still being tested as a rigorous mathematical framework for studying crystals, but it is now the basis for a new group of methods including, for example, the elimination method.  
 He worked on the electric and magnetic properties of polymers. Warren developed the term `` hyperfine structure '' for hard materials that have conformational constants low enough to be measured at a wavelength that a certain surface area can be reached by the index or axial-line method, which relies on detecting all the only possible hyperfine structures in a collection of materials.For most of his career, Warren worked with General Electric and Western Electric.In the late 1920s and early 1930s he published papers on the derivation of differential equations for elementary crystals.  
 Warren also performed a number of mathematical work on ion transport and the electron and positron exchange of hygroscopic and polymeric compounds.Warren was elected president of the American Mathematical Society in 1925.  
   
   
 == Religious beliefs ==  
 Warren was a devout Roman Catholic. He was married once, to Miss Rebecca Mallory, with whom he had a son named Michael. He was a member of the LDS Church.

John Constable ( 7 February 1837 – 20 May 1895 ) was an English physician. He studied at Brown University, London, where he received his M.D. degree in 1874. While at Brown, he gained experience in Ireland and to a lesser extent at New College, Oxford. After teaching at Brown, he served on a voyage to the East and in 1884–85, in the Indian Ocean, carried out research on whales and corals. He was appointed Research Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1880, and was succeeded as Chief Resident of the Zoological Laboratory at Oxford in 1889.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Constable was born in 1837 at Sandpit, Holmewood, in Devon, into a family of doctors. His father, George ( `` Gunner '' ) Constable, was of St George's churchyard. His brother Hugh became a physician and surgeon. Constable studied medicine in Oxford.  
 In the 1870s he went to India to practice medicine and published several books on zoology, particularly on the whale, during that period. In 1875, he went to Paris, where he worked as a physician on the Sartere Canal. In the year 1880, he accepted an invitation to go to China. In 1886, he returned to England and in the same year became Professor of Animal Physiology at Brown.  
   
   
 == Travels ==  
 In 1882, he joined a research voyage to the East, and visited Brazil and China. In 1885–86 he went to Japan. While on the voyage to the East, he spent some time in Southern India and spent a considerable amount of time there on whale studies. In 1900, he returned to Oxford and in 1905 was elected an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ).  
 In India, Constable carried out research in Kapurthala and the Hooghly River. In South India, he carried out research on whales and corals. In Southern China, he worked in the Laohung Cave and on the wall of a cave in China. His Indian and Northern British Museum collections are at the Natural History Museum of Heidelberg.  
 After this he spent much time in Ireland.In 1896, he returned to the United Kingdom and became the first Head of Health at Oxford. In 1898, he was appointed Research Professor of Animal Physiology at Brown University and was succeeded as Chief Resident of the Zoological Laboratory at Oxford. In 1901, he was elected as Professor of Biology at the University of Edinburgh.  
 In 1902, he travelled to Australia, New Guinea and Papua New Guinea. In 1904, he took a post as Professor of Zoology at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa.  
 In 1908, he returned to England and settled in the town of Batencleagh, near Oxford, becoming a Member of Parliament for the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1914, he was elected to the Royal College of Physicians, and served as its President from 1929 to 1939.  
 In 1939 he retired and moved to the Wild Duck Hotel in the East End of Oxford, where he lived until his death in 1895.

 = Arthur Turrell (botanist) =  
Arthur Turrell ( 1859–1946 ) was an English chemist. His parents were Samuel and Emma Turrell. He studied at the Royal College of Science in London and was a Professor of Chemistry at Corpus Christi College, Oxford ( 1861–1907 ). He became an eminent Anglican priest. In the post of Curate of Eccles Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, he became well known as a botanist. He authored several popular books on botany.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Arthur Turrell was born in Wentworth, Manchester on 28 October 1859. The family moved to Milton Keynes in 1865, and he and his brother Andrew spent most of the remainder of their lives there. As a young man he was a keen amateur photographer, and he bought, and painted, a series of portraits of himself as a young boy, which became famous, and became a best-seller. In 1887, Turrell edited and published an edition of a 12th-century botanical work on Polderrads by Richard Bradley, sometimes called The Bradley Catalogue of Plants, from Cambria to Gibraltar.He was the son of physician Samuel Turrell, and father of the Anglican clergyman and botanist Arthur Turrell. Turrell was the grandfather of the English atheist David Turrell.  
 He lived in Reading from his middle age to his death.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Arthur Turrell was a strict Calvinist with views on abortion and abortion practices, but his views changed to support church dogma in all areas of life. Turrell was a specialist in this branch of Christianity, and he was by far the most extensive of the theologians advocating their policy. He believed that the Bible contains all the laws of nature, and that the church was able to conclusively uphold those laws with absolute certitude. Therefore, he supported the party which tended to establish the strongest doctrines in the modern sense ( Puritanism ).  
 As such, he said that scripture contains no opinion on women, only on men, and all men are created equal. He stressed the scientific aspects of Scripture in his writings, insisting on the general validity of the Bible, even of the canonical ones, with the exception of Abraham and Isaac. He felt that Christianity needed to accept many revisions, which are usually necessary to update doctrine as new evidence comes to light. He strongly objected to marriage, especially for unmarried men. He was very disappointed with secular culture of the time, and believed that it was largely the world around him and the world around him in general that failed him, instead of his own views.

 = Henrik Fischler =  
Henrik Fischler ( 30 December 1862 – 5 September 1934 ) was a Swedish physiologist and scientist. He is best known for his publications on comparative physiology, especially for his work on the cellular complexity of the skin. In 1882 he founded the Centre for Experimental Investigation of the Brain at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. He then led experiments to determine whether pigment and other proteins can cause tissues to degenerate by affecting their specific states.  
 He was the first to show the contribution of proteins to the theory of glycogen-peroxidation in contrast to calcium-dependent oxygen metabolism and the storage of energy in the liver, where in contrast to cyanogen it is located.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Henrik Fischler was born in Uppsala in 1862. He obtained his medical doctorate in 1893 from the University of Uppsala, where in 1899 he was awarded a Chair of Physiology in Genetics and Pathology. He was later a senior lecturer at the Karolinska Institutet and in 1900–1903 head of its Department of Pathology. From 1899 until 1905 he held the chair of Zoology at the University of Stockholm. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1918. He died in 1934 in Stockholm.  
 Fischler developed several new diseases, in particular cerebral amyloidosis. His research on insulin resistance led him to hypothesize that vitamin B12 is a problem. In 1910 he demonstrated that the splenocyte mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for insulin-resistant skeletal muscle, which is an early discovery that also contributed to subsequent advances in kidney function.

 = Andr C3 A4 C3 A1c S C3 B0d (bear) =  
André Jacques Bïd, also known as C3 A1c Sédémar Sédémar C3 A1c ( February 3, 1891 – April 23, 1971 ) was a French metallurgist who also worked as the director of C. Roseau Leroy's C. Roseau Leroy Hospital at Dubuisson. He discovered the process of plane and cylinder melting in the 1923 Refining of Aluminum Ore from Copper and Magnetite : By Mechanism of Heat-ejection and by Thermoplasticity. In 1906 Sédémar developed the process of aluminium melting as a type of metal with copper as the intermediate metal. The process was used to make aluminium that could be used for new manufacturing of machinery. In 1923 Sédémar and Jacques Perreault were the first to use the same process as was later used to make niobium. Other early users of Sédémar's process included the Houston Steel Company.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 C3 A1c Sédémar was born on February 3, 1891 in Paris and attended the École des métiers. In 1898, while still a student at École des métiers, he received a `` Gérard thesis '', which he kept from 1903 to 1904. Sédémar began his lectures with a lecture `` Méthodologie des minerals d'Aluminium '' ( An Introduction to Mineralogy ), which was published in 1908. The following year, he published a book on the history of the aluminum industry, entitled `` Le process d'Aluminium '' ( Process of Aluminum ). In 1914 he published a History of the Aluminum Industry.  
   
   
 == Professional activities ==  
 In 1906 Sédémar and his teacher François Blanchard wrote the Refining of Aluminum Ore from Copper and Magnetite, their first published paper, published in French. They developed the processes of plane and cylinder melting in the 1923 Refining of Aluminum Ore from Copper and Magnetite and filed the proposal to set up the C. Roseau Leroy Hospital at Dubuisson in 1907. In the next four years Sédémar refined the process of aluminium melting into a small metal by using sandstone and natural iron. He then developed a process for steel production based on the steel-producing process used by Richard Debrandt of Roseau-Leroy in 1893. Cement production took a back seat in 1910 to the process of metal refining, as well as to the operations of the new hospital and the process of refining minerals.  
   
 In 1925 Sédémar became director of the École des métiers at the École royale des Mines de Villeneuve. He played an important role in the International Tin Industry, having coined the term `` smelting '' for the process of producing and refining the small metal known as smelted tin.In 1929, while in hospital in Paris, he developed laminar flow, but was eventually pressured to discontinue it because of too much fatigue caused by repeated grinding.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 André Sédémar died on April 23, 1971 in Rouen.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Sédémar married Françoise Drouois, daughter of pianist André Paul Drouois and Lèse Kerfhoff.

 = Thomas Franklin (naturalist) =  
Thomas Franklin ( 14 September 1818 – 28 November 1888 ) was an English chemist and mycologist.  
 Franklin was educated at nearby Shoreham School. His father James Franklin ( 1765–1835 ) was Superintendent of St. Thomas'School for Boys and Director of the British Museum. Thomas also grew up and attended Shoreham School. At age 15 he was made an apprentice by John Griffiths, professor of chemistry at Teddington College and the chemist at sea.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Thomas was born on 14 September 1818, son of Timothy and Mary Ann Franklin. He attended Shoreham School, later being known as Isleworth. He took a keen interest in chemistry and was elected as an alternate at the local polytechnic, which in turn encouraged his interests.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1836, after studying for a year at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, he accepted a job as part of a prominent family business, that of consulting firm `` Edward Burton '', run by his father, which was later amalgamated to create the Fisher & Warner Company. The firm made improvements to local service throughout the East Riding of Yorkshire, which then came under federal government. William Morgan Fisher, another employee of Edward Burton, became the company's general manager in 1851 and created the Fisher & Warner estate to house his firm's operations in the local area. At the time, Edward's wealth and influence secured him wide access to government.  
   
   
 == Teaching career ==  
 In 1847, Franklin began teaching chemistry at Bury St Edmunds and graduated in 1850. He was promoted to head chemistry teacher at the School, initially to Balliol College but later to St Thomas'School, in Hackney, which had become an early model for the University of Cambridge. He was also appointed head of his old school, North Staffordshire School of Pharmacy, which he continued to teach until his retirement in 1880. Franklin kept a keen interest in science from an early age and encouraged the use of apparatus that improved the efficiency and safety of both chemical and mechanical research. He wrote many reports on various subjects, including chemistry and a chemical microscope.Beginning in 1863, Franklin had his new school open to the public and encouraged new pupils and visitors to join the school for social purposes. In 1868, students and staff were building the first building to house the main laboratory of the Geological Survey, in Hyde Park, which is now the Edward Franklin Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. That year, he married Mary Steyn, a schoolmistress. Their children included :  
 Mary Grainger Franklin ( 1864–1887 ) and Douglas Franklin ( 1866–1929 ).Douglas was a friend of Professor William Watson in the University of Bristol, and the two had a successful partnership when Franklin left in 1882. They had two children, Alice and Robert :  
   
   
 == Medical career ==  
 The publication of Dr. Agar's Conjugate of nitrate, which he first published in 1874, improved the technique of mycological and microbiological research and provided a new route for mycologists to investigate the nature of mycological species and how they differed from one another. The discovery of cyanomyces yeast ( Agar's coal ) provided support for a broad-spectrum treatment of carbapenems and other fungi, which was illustrated by the discovery of cryptogamic fungi, such as Rhododendron cryptogamicum and Vesicularia junius.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Dr. Franklin wrote and published more than 250 papers and reviews, including investigations into the bacterial lipases, microflora and cytology of coal mines, the occurrence of Cyanomyces fungal spores in oil wells, and several types of fungi. He was a primary author of several leading monographs, as well as numerous co-authored journal articles, and he contributed to the United States National Library of Medicine and the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His report on the hard science of yeast cells is widely considered a classic in this field. His earlier papers on fungus discovered by the miner Alfred Rose under the United States system of mineral deposits were for more than half a century the definitive source for the broad scientific discussion of the fungi that inhabit underground rock basins.The mineral and botanical names of crystals found in several valleys in British India include :

 == Biography ==  
 David Eagleman was born in Manhattan, New York. He attended Howard University, then enrolled in graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After completing his undergraduate degree he moved to the US to work as a computer scientist for a defense contractor. While at MIT, he and his then-girlfriend Dacher Keltner developed a personal computer using the Tianar–Jehovah keyboard, and at MIT the world's first simulated cell. David was interested in machine learning, and for this he was awarded the M.Sc. degree. During the early years of his PhD, while his wife was writing the thesis, he had several interactions with R. Ron Cutler, a researcher at the U.S. Navy's Defense Research and Development Agency. Cutler allowed David to develop Riemannian models for many statistical and physical problems. They soon collaborated on the analysis of key decision problems. His work on the dissertation with Cutler led to his permanent employment at Harvard in 1972. Eagleman also served as a Research Associate at the Department of Defense's Technical Research Program.  
 In the late 1980s he founded Eagleman, a new branch of mathematics and computational physics. His main work, the Dynamic Dynamical Control Section, produced the first fully verifiable experimental code for a computer. The entire work was a collaboration between Eagleman and Othmar Schall of the Telecommunications Research Center, in North Park, Illinois. The result is the Eagleman Test Suite, now fully operational.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After founding his department at Harvard in 1988, he spent the next 16 years in an increasing role, both within the department as well as as in the international community. He was president of the Association for Computational Mathematics and, from 2001 to 2005, was President of the Asper Institute. He also served as the chairman of the National Academy of Sciences'Joint Computer Science Symposiums from 2005 to 2008. He was awarded the R. Robertson Fund's Paul M.

 = Julius Abhand =  
Julius Abhand ( ; January 12, 1858 in Dresden – February 14, 1948 in Liège ) was a German pioneer of optical design of telescopes, having built a substantial number of spectroscopic instruments. He has been described as the `` father of optics ''.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Abhand studied geology and optics at the University of Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1861. From 1865 to 1866 he was professor of physics at Leipzig. In 1872 he became professor of optics in the physics department at the University of Liège, a position which he held until his death. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy in 1878.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 As a teacher and advocate of optics, Abhand developed many experiments. A good deal of his work is in the journal Optik. At Leipzig, he edited a leading textbook on optics, `` Die Ordnung der Optik '' ( 1865–1882 ). Abhand's laboratory at Liège was home to many of his most important students, including Claude-Alexis Moritat, Oscar Ruggiero, Otto Wiglesworth, Hennig Weinstock, Harald Blasdorf, Rudolf Mohr, Christian Jacobu, André Gantt, Wilhelm Herminhoff, and Frederic von Blücher.  
 Abhand published numerous papers and papers about optics. His chief contribution to optical research was his classification and description of the spectral lines which in general form the optics axis of a telescope. These lines are now termed the abtheil lines.  
 Abhand is commemorated in the name Abhand's triangle, which is named after him.

 = Harry Schultze =  
Harry Schultze ( 17 October 1793 – 24 December 1845 ) was an Irish botanist and lithographer, known for his numerous plant illustrations and his classic textbooks, Flora of Ireland.Born to Zaccaria and Maurice Schultze at Coolharbour in County Fermanagh, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1824 to study medicine and eventually obtained his bachelor's degree in 1829. He was the last of the Schultzes and entered the Church of Ireland in 1835. He took the degree of B.D. in 1841.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 The Flora of Ireland ( 1840 ) is the first of Schultze's books to publish with plates. In the pages of this book, he continues the study and identification of many native plants and illustrations are clear and easy to understand. Schultze illustrated the Flora of Ireland with over one hundred plates that contain up to ninety thousand different plant species. One of his best-known designs was a giant Atlas with a grid system. Its 40 cm ( 12 inch ) high thickness is unusually tall for a book. The Atlas would cover an acre of land. The grid system is implemented here with rows of identical grid tiles for each species, and the grid included six species in each row. A beetle with eight rows of green would match with the plants for the second row of the new planting. As the book has to print so many green plants, each row contains eight green leaf forms which has to be arranged according to the grid into rows of new plants, in the table of `` Leaf Forms '' below. The column of green forms would be rotated by 180 degrees and the character `` A '' in the sheet for the genus would be set to line up with the next new plant for that species.In addition to the Flora of Ireland, Schultze illustrated about 70 other books. He also published at least two historical and archaeological books, Journey to Ireland ( 1851 ) and Tree Plants in Ireland. An American Citizen in Ireland ( 1854 ) was the oldest Irish-language historical narrative by an American, published in the US in 1825.When Schultze died, his wife, a laywoman, inherited the family fortune. He had written his chief work Flora of Ireland in his will shortly before his death.Schultze also translated into English by others Flora de Nilcarne : La Reine ( 1845 ) by Gaetano Mocenigo, Paracelsus ( 1845 ) by George Siebersbach and Flora de Bretagne ( 1848 ) by Jean D'Anville. He published the seven volumes of the Flora de Bretagne in 1850 and the four volumes of the Paracelsus in 1852.  
 The `` Leaf Forms '' section in the latter book is named for the growths of mallow and rose plants on which Schultze drew and numbered.

 = Joel Spence Leibovitz =  
Joel Spence Leibovitz ( 17 December 1836 – 26 May 1918 ) was a British eugenicist and one of the founders of the American Eugenics movement.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Leibovitz was born at Methuen in Surrey, and came to England in 1844. He went on to study under William Herschel, a leading Harvard professor of comparative psychology, and worked as an assistant to Horace Penrose. In 1861, at the instigation of a friend, he produced the famed Leibovitz–Penrose Testing Bible. This was a complete list of every exam, and was supposedly designed to show the size of difference that could be observed between persons of different race.  
 In 1865, he was promoted to lecturer, and, by 1868, to lecturer and head of the department of education at the Bristol Academy. In 1868, he helped to establish the General Anthropological Institute in London.Leibovitz was a member of the Eugenics Society of Great Britain, and served as the society's president from 1865 to 1869.  
 In 1878 he married Emily Galloway ( 1807–1914 ), a school teacher. His papers include entries in biographical journals, including The Bristol Women's Journal and St. Thomas's Monthly Journal of Natural Philosophy, and he also collaborated with Walter Briggs, the head of the American Social Science Association.  
   
   
 == Criticism and legacy ==  
 Samuel Bernard Meyer, in his description of Leibovitz's work, compared the curriculum of British education to that of the Third Reich, under the doctrine that `` a thorough knowledge of history is the most important of all the essential prerequisites ''.  
 The American Eugenics Society, founded in 1918, has made it an explicit policy not to accept nominations for fellowships from Jewish and Christian leaders. The Conservative Alliance describes this statement as an `` international betrayal of British ethnic principles, siding with the Nazis over British men of good will and decency ''.Paul Ehrlich, who used to lead the Michigan Eugenics Society, wrote in 1918 : `` Very few among the leading professional minds of Britain had regard to the potentially disastrous consequences to their own work if the relationship became troubled. `` In 1879, Leibovitz published his Second System of Psychology, a study of the psychology of race. According to Richard Lewontin, this examination of the psychology of race was the foundation for the later study of `` mental pathology '', the theory that all groups were mentally similar.  
 A change in Eugenics policies has been apparent since his death, with less focus on ascertaining mental health of the general public. In 2012, a group called the Act of Eugenics Committee decided to focus instead on turning back the tide on the expansion of artificial contraception.

 MacMillan was the author of The Calculus of Geometry, the first book on metric geometry and its relationship to the more general application of mathematics in science.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 MacMillan was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and moved to the United States with his family during the period when the United States was still part of Britain. He graduated from Harvard University with a degree in 1797, and at the same time got a fellowship in mathematics from Robert Boyle, who had obtained his degree from Oxford. In 1810 he graduated with a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his doctorate there with a thesis on `` On the Influence of the Magnetic Pole on Equilibrium and Compression of the Earth ''.  
 In 1823 he was appointed assistant in mathematics to the geologist Frederic Sees, whose work he followed until 1836, when he became professor of algebra and mechanics in the University of Pennsylvania. MacMillan served as the university's vice-president and moved to Pittsburgh to become the chair of geology.  
 In 1844 he was appointed by the Pennsylvania legislature to be superintendent of the new department of geology and mineralogy, and the position was repeatedly held by him until his death. MacMillan died of fever in 1886, and his obituary in the Proceedings of the Pennsylvania Academy described him as `` the most distinguished scientist in our day '', and especially of all the science he had `` undertaken for the public benefit ''.

Lucas Currie FRS ( 16 May 1657 – 10 February 1702 ) was an English geologist and mathematician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Torquay, Norfolk, son of George the Elder Currie, 4th Earl of Torquay, by his first wife Eliza Currie and his second wife Anne Glover ( d. 1707 ), daughter of Sir John Glover ( d. 1707 ). Lucas lived at John and King's Wharf, London.Currie was educated at Oxford, under Benjamin Johnson and Thomas Loudon, studying with David Perkins and Alexander Pinsent.His mathematics degree, which he won at the age of fifteen, he obtained by study of geometry and algebraic equation theory. He enrolled in the Royal College of Science, and was second only to his master Charles Martinin in his ordination.While at Cambridge, he had become friends with his master James Davy, an amateur geologist, and also with the English naturalist Thomas Brookes. A year after leaving Cambridge, Davy made him a fellow of the Royal Society.  
 After returning from India to London in 1677, Currie entered the University of Oxford, where he studied under David Hume, Thomas Hooke, and Edward Baudelaire. In 1689, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.  
 In 1691, Currie succeeded James Davy as lecturer of mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of Oxford ; a year later he also held this post at Oxford College. He was a firm friend of the experimentalist Richard Tait, who was one of his students at Oxford.  
 On 17 September 1701, Currie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. On 24 April 1702, he became the 3rd Earl of Torquay ( from 1702 to 1732 ).Currie's collections are in the Library of King's College London, where his circle included his old tutor Thomas Beddoes, his professor in mathematics ( Baudelaire was also a student of Currie ), his son, the mathematician Sir Isaac Newton, and the engineer and writer Henry Wotton, and the artist John Standish. He is buried in the east choir churchyard in Holloway, and is buried next to his companion David Ripon in Loxley Cemetery.

 He was born on November 18, 1879, in a large house on the estate of Sarah Nottage at St Louis, Missouri, with a sister, Elizabeth. He attended public school, which was closed in 1887 because of poor health, and then entered the University of Missouri, where he graduated with a degree in natural history in 1893. He moved to the United States when the University of Missouri was not yet established as a public university, and attended a teacher training school in Los Angeles, California.  
 In 1899 he earned a degree in geology from the University of Texas at Austin. In 1903 he was promoted to teach marine biology, and in 1907 he was appointed geologist to the United States Department of Agriculture, where he maintained his personal and professional relationships with numerous field biologists for the next twenty-five years, publishing his most important work and providing other contributions. He received a state appointment as a professor of geology at the University of Kentucky in 1907. His most notable work was the chapter on New Species of Cicada, published in 1913. He served as secretary of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) from 1927 to 1931. In 1925, he was appointed to serve as president of the International Union of Zoological Nomenclature and Vertebrate Paleontology, which had recently been created. He was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from 1930 to 1935. His collection of sand beaches at Saint Louis was named after him.

 = George Herman Bellinghausen =  
George Herman Bellinghausen ( 7 April 1861 – 9 February 1935 ) was a Dutch chemist and malacologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bellinghausen was born in Amsterdam. After a thorough study of science, he completed his medical degree from the Free University of Brussels, and began his career as an experimental pathologist, developing an interest in the effects of alcohols and pesticides. He conducted research at the University of Liège under the supervision of Hermann von Helmholtz. Bellinghausen received the British Royal Medal in 1879 and the Royal Medal of the Netherlands in 1884.  
 His most notable discovery was the first demonstration of chemical mobility, also known as liquid-non-metallic microspheres, as well as a field-effect microsphere, which was a device which demonstrated high strength and speed at very low temperatures.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Bellinghausen obtained his habilitation in chemistry from the University of Liège in 1888 and spent most of his later life at Liège, where he conducted clinical work and was appointed a professor of chemistry and physics at the Faculty of Medicine in 1899. At Liège he led the Swedish textile institute in their first years of existence, and in 1912 succeeded Carl Stiegler as director of the institute and dean of the chemistry department. Bellinghausen worked on the stationary gel theory, developed in the 1880s, which was the basis for the mineral hypothesis of J. J. Thomson. He also developed an instrument for measuring the half-life of solvent ( later used for the record keeping of chemical reactions ). In 1889 Bellinghausen published the `` tetrahedral disulfide ring '' ( TEDS ), a discovery which put him at the forefront of the ether theory. The tetrahedral disulfide ring was the first such theoretical unit to be provided with stereophase, the polymerization process involved in the manufacturing of silicon dioxide, a compound widely used in today's electronics, and was particularly important in the dye process. He also discovered the euthenic liquid state of amino acids ( 1894 ).  
 In 1893 Bellinghausen co-founded the Allgemeine Physikae des Chemie-Neueren Vereins ( APNV ), a research group which investigated the role of formaldehyde as an absorbent and dispersant for microspheres. He spent the rest of his career at the AMNH, where he oversaw the development of many outstanding chemical instruments such as the microspheres and electromagnetic oscillators, creating one of the best laboratories in the world.  
 Bellinghausen died in Liège, aged 65, on 9 February 1935. He is buried at the Abbeville cemetery.  
   
   
 == Awards and honours ==  
 Bellinghausen was a recipient of the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1918 and the George Weyl Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1931.

Heinrich Pfeiffer ( 22 April 1851 – 29 October 1919 ) was a German-born and pioneering German chemist. He was born in Rome, Sicily and studied at the Technische Hochschule Wien in Vienna with Gustav Pestalozzi and Ludwig Brandmüller. In 1869 he became assistant to Gustav Pestalozzi and there acquired the rank of professor of organic chemistry. In 1872, after an operation for an injured knee, he moved to Copenhagen, where he founded his own laboratory there. He taught at the University of Copenhagen from 1876 until his death in 1919.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Pfeiffer was an early and dedicated follower of Pertwee. In 1873 he was appointed by Emil Mabury as a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Copenhagen. Pfeiffer became a member of the Danish Royal Academy of Sciences in 1876, serving as its president from 1879 to 1881. From that time to 1904 he also served as an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1903 he became a full professor of chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, becoming the first chairman of the Danish Academy of Sciences in 1882.In 1904 Pfeiffer published his first edition of his textbook on the subject of chemical changes and transformation. His next book, Elementa Energetica ( Elements of Experimental Energetics ), was published in 1909.  
 In 1921 he co-founded the Institut für Chemie und Sozialforschung in Copenhagen. He retired from his position in 1925. In 1927 he published the work Zur Mechanik der Pflanzen and in 1928 another volume, Chemie Untersuchungen über die Wirkung in den Transformation als Stephanus Lippmann, wherein he gave the molecular structure of proteins. Pfeiffer's lifetime's work encompassed theories on macroscopic evaporation of metals, a phenomenological theory of light and color, and the polymer theory of the phases of phenylisothiazolinone, also known as a given-color theory. In addition, he received the University Medal and a doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and he became a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences. In 1924 he began the work of translating into English Pertwee's famous book Elements of Experimental Chemistry into German. This work was a major contributor to the further development of chemical physics during the 19th century and played a major role in the transition from the purely physical to the more sophisticated theories of Bohr.  
 After his death, his son Ferdinand Pfeiffer was chosen as an honorary member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

 Bach was born in Braunschweig, one of four children of Siegfried Bach, who was the commander of the Hessian Army and Kaiser Wilhelm I's physician in northern Germany. One of his brothers, Franz, was also a composer and educator. He graduated from the local grammar school in 1784. As a schoolteacher in the local town of Eppendorf-Dienst, Bach was deeply influenced by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He is said to have taught Goethe's son Ludwig so that he could become a composer, though details remain unclear. During his time in Eppendorf-Dienst he was known as `` Nr. Bach, or the Father of German Music '', an homage to Goethe's influence on the composer and musician. As a composer Bach primarily wrote piano pieces for piano, for string quartets and chamber music, and German Romantic music. In addition, Bach also wrote and composed for chamber music, and lieder. He published several works of theoretical piano pedagogy, including Wald- und zum Zusammenhöhe, römische Untersuchungen aus ihren einige Amtzehnten in ihrem letzten Zusammenhang.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1796 he became a schoolteacher in the village of Breslau ( then part of Upper Palatinate, now Breslau, Bavaria ), where he continued to practice piano until his death in 1871. While in Eppendorf-Dienst he was encouraged by local Jesuits and deans. In 1803, after successfully completing the `` Die Mannesbürgerdienst '' ( course of piano study ), he was appointed professor of pedagogy in the academy, a position he held until 1804.He also directed a school in Erfurt, and taught piano and musical composition there, and in Breslau and Mönchenbüttel. Bach was a member of the Bavarian Cultural Association and one of the founders of the Stellliche Musikverein, and co-founded the Encyklopädie für Musik von Lower Palatinate. From 1805 he lectured at the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Freiburg and Freiburg-am-Main.In 1823 Bach authored his most popular, and longest-lasting, book, Der Leben Blut- und Bücher. It first appeared in 1824 under the title Das Originalisten und Testimonyen, and was, in 1824, translated into German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Polish. The book itself contained many impassioned essays on both music theory and the expressive works of music, although he also avoided several difficult ideas such as melodic dichotomy and tonal pitch. The book was well received by its composer, Richard Wagner, who later invited Bach to write music for him for use in his operas. Bach also wrote some simple chamber works for piano. In 1835 he was appointed chaplain at the Benedictine monastery of Cracow, after having served there for only a year.Bach's Beiträge zur Altertumsphilosophie ( 1825 ) is considered to be a classic in the German musical literature. Bach studied with Heinrich Schelling, and explored new musical approaches. His travels in the years 1827–28 and 1830–32 at Franz Liszt's court, Venice and the Pontifical Athenaeum during the latter's lifetime, encouraged him to create his own more progressive compositional ideas. Bach was also influenced by Franz Schubert, whose music he was familiar with, such as the Piano Sonata in C major.

 = Edwin P. Cleet =  
Edwin P. Cleet ( June 12, 1924 – February 13, 2000 ) was an American physicist and mathematician.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Cleet was born in Southam, Texas, on June 12, 1924, the son of the biologist August Cleet and his wife, Beverly Delacourt. Cleet's father was `` young, sweet, and courteous '', but his life was not quite the happiest. His mother died when Edwin was a baby. He was raised by his father, an electrical engineer from Bainbridge, Virginia, in a patriarchal family in the hamlet of Southam. He attended DeMatha College in Bethesda, Maryland, in the fall of 1951, and earned a B.S. degree in mathematics in 1956.  
 Cleet completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia University in New York City in 1957 with a thesis on additive dynamics, developed by Edward Harrison Sherman, known at Columbia as `` the father of space and elasticity ''.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After graduation, Cleet began work at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  
 He worked on exotic elasticity problems and `` thermodynamics ''. He was also an experimental physicist with the RAND Corporation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, specializing in theoretical problems and conducting investigations of spectral line integrals, the subharmonics of light, and photoelectricity.  
 In 1958 he developed a method for the detection of photon emissions from a particle accelerator under Columbia's Leonard Peebles Laboratory.Cleet's research work was interrupted by the Vietnam War. As a diplomat, Cleet enjoyed having his fingernails brushed by President Harry S. Truman and by fellow officers and astronauts. He earned his PhD at Columbia from 1955 to 1957 under the supervision of Alexander C. Hertzmann, a distinguished physicist at the Radcliffe Laboratory of Columbia University's Kennedy School of Government. In 1959, Cleet and Hertzmann returned to Brookhaven National Laboratory to join their students in the group `` Eliminating Impurities '', working on short-lived electromagnetic radiation from ionization. The study involved timing the emission of radio waves from a xenon source in a high-energy particle accelerator using no energy of the radioactive element uranium, but multiple sources, such as uranium-239, had previously been detected using similar methods. They presented their findings to the US Atomic Energy Commission at their request. The radiation observed by experimenters in 1965 is known as the Cleet–Hertzmann effect.  
   
 In 1966, Cleet became director of the Physical Measurement and Solid State Electronics Laboratory of Brookhaven National Laboratory, now known as the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1970 he became chairman of the Physical Measurement and Solid State Electronics Division at the National Bureau of Standards. In 1973, Cleet retired, but continued at Brookhaven for the next 14 years. He died in Miami, Florida, on February 13, 2000.Cleet received an honorary D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1974. He was awarded the Henry Draper Walker Distinguished Service Award in Science in 1986, the Bradbury Medal of the American Physical Society in 1997, and the Alpha Ceramidor Award of the American Physical Society in 1999.  
   
   
 == Honors ==  
 Awarded numerous international awards and honors, including the Award of the Linnean Society of London ( 1959 ), the Masson Medal of the International Organization of Radio Engineers ( 1982 ), the IFRAM Medal ( 1984 ), the World Physics Prize ( 1986 ), and the William Tyrrell Bell Award ( 1989 ).  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Cleet married his wife, Theresa De La Reineffle Cleet, in 1963. Together they were divorced in 1980. Cleet died at his home in Miami, Florida, on February 13, 2000. He is buried in Miami Gardens Cemetery.

 = Philip William Beard =  
Philip William Beard ( 11 September 1860 – 4 October 1947 ) was an English physicist and administrator, who spent most of his life at the University of Nottingham and was appointed vice-chancellor in 1949.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Beard was born on 11 September 1860 in Camberwell, Gloucestershire, the son of Rev George William Beard of Hotham Hall, Oxford. The eldest of four sons, he was the great-grandson of Dr. William the Silent, who was `` noted as a selfless philanthropist, prepared to sacrifice himself for the welfare of others ''. A blacksmith and taylor, he was educated at Holy Trinity School, Oxford, and graduated in 1874, going on to earn the degree of LL.B. in 1875.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1878, Beard became a lecturer in mechanical science at Manchester College ( then a public school in Manchester, England, which bears his name ). He held this post until 1884, when he was appointed deputy dean of engineering in Titchfield, England, where he continued until 1886. He was also professor of physical chemistry in Oxford.  
 Beard was well known for his work in the study of interplanetary motion, the determination of velocity and direction of sub-atomic particles, and his discovery of the vascular toad : a term he coined, arthropod.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Beard was born in Camberwell on 11 September 1860, the son of John John Beard, a linen merchant, and his wife, Sarah Kate. His mother, who was of Indian descent, had raised two daughters, Margaret ( now Margaret Beard ), a painter, and Adelia, a chorister and the first secretary of Oxford University's Lady's College, where Beard was educated. Beard's paternal grandparents were the industrialist John John Beard and his wife Caroline Grange Grey, daughter of James Grey, 1st Earl Grey. At his father's death in 1883, Philip Jr. was sent to spend his youth in the care of his aunt, the publisher Margaret Grainger, followed by a brief period at the Rancourt Senior Infirmary in Chertsey. In 1887, his aunt died, leaving him free to pursue his studies at Oxford. In 1890, he studied mathematics and physics, graduating B.A. in 1890. In 1892, he became a postgraduate, a post he held for a number of years. In 1895, he was appointed lecturer in mechanical science at Manchester College, which was then a public school. In 1895, he became vice-chancellor of the university and from 1897 until his retirement in 1953, he was Dean of Engineering. His son was Reginald John Beard ( 1885–1965 ), who was a senior in the Cambridge cricket team.After the First World War, Beard left the university for another six years to work as a civil engineer and engineer-in-residence at Bolton ( Norfolk ), before returning to Manchester in 1922. In 1924, he became the first vice-chancellor of Nottingham College, which, from then until 1950, was part of the University of Nottingham.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Beard's most important scientific contributions included the use of semipermeable mirrors to measure specific gravity. This led him to the discovery of the corpuscles of organisms. He was the author of extensively cited papers in the physical literature in which he calculated the possible migration of small particles at sub-microscopic velocities. This was then replicated, and was independently confirmed in 1928 by Mott, Mortimer and Shephard, and independently confirmed again in 1929 by Frank Buchan. In 1931, Beard also achieved international prominence when he suggested that James Clerk Maxwell's best estimate for the speed of light was actually 0.15 nanometres per second. He demonstrated in detail that Maxwell's estimate for the speed of light was an exact mathematical approximation.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 On 4 October 1947, Beard, 65, retired as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham. During his last few years at Nottingham, he was assisting the excavation of Newton's Great Tower. He was survived by his wife, sister, two sons and two daughters. His son Reginald Beard, also born at Nottingham, died of pneumonia in 1966, aged 31, at Nottingham General Hospital.

 == Biography ==  
 Jay Parikh was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Parikh married Pat ( née Muellen ), who worked for the Winnipeg Sons of Sweden, and Förster. He served in the navy for 16 years and was stationed in Japan during World War II, and then Canada's Ministry of Communications ( now Ministry of Foreign Affairs ), during which time he received a Master of Arts from the University of Manitoba. He returned to Winnipeg to attend university, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in psychology in 1941. He completed his Master of Science in 1942 and became a private in the reserves. In the summer of 1944 he joined the navy as a ship's draftsman.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === First trade union chief ===  
 Parikh joined the Winnipeg Federation of Labour in 1948 as the director of the training section for the city's military draft board. In 1956 he became its national executive council, and eventually became its chief executive in the spring of 1960. He was superintendent of the press office from 1961 to 1968 and president of the Winnipeg Public Libraries from 1968 to 1972. Parikh led the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission from 1976 to 1977, and in 1981 he became the commissioner for competition. The annual Cribfest was renamed by him as `` Jay Parikh Cribfest '' in his honour.  
   
   
 === Law Department ===  
 At age 50, Parikh joined the law faculty at the University of Winnipeg to broaden his knowledge of Canadian law. Parikh retired as professor in 1983 and was succeeded by his son Peter Parikh. He was a recipient of the Knight, Order of Canada, twice, in 1962 and 1965.In his later life, Parikh is said to have been `` a perfectly placid and articulate person. ''  
   
   
 === Public Service ===  
   
 Parikh was appointed director of the Ministry of Labour's Industry Section in 1959 and elected as a trustee of the Bank of Canada ( Bocorp ) in 1966. He was Canada's first president of the Communications Workers of America ( CWA ), a government agency whose purpose was to encourage unionization in the construction of wireless systems. The company laid off some 4,000 workers during the 1963 strike, and sent them to the Republican Auditorium in Toronto to prepare a bill that would repeal the 1963 legislation which had done so much to weaken the collective bargaining rights of workers. When Parikh learned about the outcome of the strike, he invited members of the AWA who had been drafted by the strikers to his home in Toronto and stated that they would not be receiving any retribution if they stayed in Canada. In 1978 Parikh advised the government of Quebec not to renew its contract with the industry section, which was due to expire after a decade of operation. Parikh advised the government that the province had the power to terminate the contract on its own. Parikh supported the repeal of the Radio Act in 1977, and he again urged the provincial government not to do so. In 1977 the entire board of directors of CWA, including Parikh, resigned to save CWA $ 19 million.In 1982 Parikh was named president of the CBC Broadcasting Commission. He became a member of the Commission's board in 1984 and of its executive committee in 1985.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Parikh died at home in Winnipeg in 1997. He is best known for `` Jay Parikh's '' criticism of the Canadian Broadcasting Act which he helped to codify and was a key voice in removing from its Canadian text, amendments to which he helped orchestrate. The CBC later cited him as being part of the design team responsible for overhauling the Act.

 = Paul  C3 A9n Russell =  
Paul Joseph ( Piotr ) Russell, ( also known as Maksim Șiăn ) ( July 27, 1919 – August 6, 2003 ) was a Romanian physicist. He was an eminent teacher, administrator and social and cultural influence. He was also a key researcher in the field of cosmology.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Education ===  
   
 Paul Russell was born in Pişmen, the son of Cyril and Mathilde Russell. He studied physics at Bucharest University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1931. He then enrolled in the newly founded University of Bucharest in 1934, and completed his Ph.D. in physics in 1936 with the thesis `` The effect of the hydrogen-air mixture in a magnetosphere ''. He continued teaching, attending seminars on magnetic and aeronautics as a guest lecturer. As a graduate student in the same year, he also became a full professor.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 After graduating, he accepted an appointment as an associate professor in the physics department at the Faculty of Science in Bucharest. He soon became a professor, and in 1957, a full professor. The school's successor, the Faculty of Technology, in 1960 became his alma mater. He was also appointed as the Acting Head of the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science. He held this position until 1973, and as an honorary professor until 1979. He died in Bucharest in 2003.  
   
   
 === Research ===  
   
 He is best known for his research in the application of nuclear magnetic resonance in optical and radio astronomy, where he applied theories from quantum mechanics to the analysis of motion in galaxies. The problem was posed by the implication of static electricity-magnetic fields on the observed motion of binary stars. In its most basic form, he concluded that these fields, caused by interactions of strong and weak magnetic fields on nearby stars, produce electromagnetic structures not observed in observed stellar systems.Russell's work on the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) inspired two subsequent cosmological textbooks, one written by Georges Rolland-Barthaume at the University of Grenoble in 1946 and another by Mihail Feugelé in 1952. In the latter he presented a better analysis of the cosmic microwave background, and he was awarded the chair at the Romanian Academy of Sciences in 1967. He also had an influential academic contribution in terms of the aesthetics of cosmology, resulting in his The Mainframe Geometrical Architecture ( 1958 ) and Interaction of Atomic Fields ( 1965 ).The discovery of neutrinos in 1977 challenged the model of Russell and Feugelé that neutrinos are particles bound together by a metal nucleus ( or antiferromagnet ), as was thought previously. However, neutrinos can also be seen as `` invisible '' particles, often appearing in low amounts, and have been dubbed dark matter. The discovery was the culmination of 28 years of work by B.S.E. Russell and M.S.M. Feugelé, which he was initially unaware of, and which led him to form an entirely new paradigm regarding neutrinos.  
 He also created a magnetic time-averaging station in Pescăişnă, which used external measuring instruments for its measurements, and was considered to be the first such time-averaging station in the world.  
   
   
 == Awards ==  
 In 1968, he received the Dr. Petro-Sangaran Prize ( an award from the Romanian Academy of Sciences ), of the Division of Educational Research. In the same year he received the G. Lucescu-Sinc or William E. Creighton Award ( awarded by the Linnean Society of Edinburgh ), the world's most prestigious international recognition for discovering a new science. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the Royal Society in 1992, and elected a Foreign Member of the American Physical Society in 1999. In 1983, he received the Costa Medal, awarded to outstanding Romanian scientists. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, Royal Academy of Sciences of Bucharest ( Romanian : ( Nămenhora Bucharest ) Romanieții ) ( Zagăbul ) ( or Aristeza Bucharest ), and his name is inscribed on the Pantheon of Rome, with the title of Paul Christian Russell.

Sir Neil Chamberlain ( 23 April 1919 – 22 September 2007 ) was a British engineer, naturalist and mountaineer. A member of the Society of the Explorers of the Sky, Chamberlain was an observer of meteorites, and a friend and mentor of John Mackenzie. His scientific interest in these objects led him to commission photographs of the local stars at all hours of the day to be able to provide him with an annual grant of £100, which he used to travel to Antarctica. In 1972 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Chamberlain was born in Alderley, Devon. After winning a scholarship to Aberystwyth High School in 1947, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1952, graduating with First Class honours in that subject in 1958. During the Second World War he was discharged as a second lieutenant in the British Army for good behaviour but continued studying meteorites from 1950 to 1966.  
 During the 1960s, he worked as a young engineer on projects for the British Geological Survey ( GGS ), spending most of the time travelling in Africa, where he contributed to the technical information produced by the USGS Meteorite Mapping Project in Zimbabwe. He then returned to Cambridge where he served as a research associate with the GGS from 1965 to 1970, before returning to a family connection with local biology, and travelling with his father on holiday from 1966 to 1968 to observe the effects of ageing on Tasmanian rock beetles. While still at Cambridge, he joined the University of Witwatersrand and did post-doctoral work at the University of Cape Town as an assistant in mathematics and the history of science.

 = Hermann Inzlicht =  
Hermann Inzlicht ( 7 January 1877 – 6 July 1953 ) was a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist. Inzlicht was a physician and medical author. Inzlicht is best known for his expertise in antisemitic literature and art therapy, with particular emphasis on the experience of a Jew.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Inzlicht was born in Leipzig, the son of a Dr. Albrecht Inzlicht ( 1841-1899 ) and his wife Eva Gertrude Thomas. His paternal grandfather was an anti-Nazi war criminal. He was involved in the University of Leipzig from 1897 to 1907. As a student, he spent some time in Düsseldorf ( 1912 ), with his friend Franz Haumbach ( 1884-1955 ). While in Düsseldorf, Inzlicht decided to study philosophy, entering the faculty of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt-am-Main ( where he spent the following two years ). He then moved on to the Berlin Medical School ( 1910-1913 ), where he was one of the founders of the Department of Psychology. In his doctoral thesis, he had failed to notice a clear difference in the personalities of adults with great negative experiences who received light therapy from Kurt Eisner and others, and those with negative experiences who received heavy therapy from Wolfgang Tillich. He also referred to psychotherapy as a mode of intervention. He taught at the University of Basel, the State University of Munich and the Albert Einstein University of Frankfurt-am-Main.  
 Inzlicht was the founder of the biopharmacological research group of Prof. Achille Turchenberg, who helped establish the family practice `` Inzlicht '' for neuropsychiatric patients, with whom he made the distinction between psychotic disorders and non-psychiatric hypomanic disorders. He also contributed articles to Rudolf Neruda's Phantasie, concerning the cerebral basis of mental disorders ( Trans. World. Biol. Mag. 75, 53-60, 1911 ). Inzlicht also published L ’ année privée des nightmares ( 1925 ) and Matériel sur les lettres psychoses ( 1934 ).In the latter of these two publications he established a `` second 'path of light''' for schizophrenia patients, and that of hypomania.  
 His last name is the Biblical Christoph Inzlicht from Jerusalem, which is the name of his beloved daughter and many of his famous works.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Inzlicht was the author of the preface to Kurt Eisner's Psychotherapy : The History of a Radical Therapy ( 1920 ). The English translation was published posthumously in 1934 as A Psychoanalytic Guide to Psychoanalysis, with the American Psychoanalytic Association, and Inzlicht ’ s latter name was bestowed upon the English title of Professor L ’ année privée des nightmares. His new English translation published posthumously in 1944 is The Book of Jewish Satires and the Language of Chrestomania.

 = Piotr Knik =  
Piotr Jakub Knik ( July 4, 1890 – December 9, 1967 ) was a Polish economist, writer, politician, reformer, socialist and economist.  
 Knik was a vocal critic of both National Bolshevism and Stalinism, and was at the forefront of organizing a nonviolent resistance to the German Occupation of Poland in 1942. He founded the Częstochowa ( Association for Combatting Communism ) and served as its first chairman from 1948-1951.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Knik was born in 1890 in Warsaw to a farming family. He attended the [ Ukrainian ] Russian school in Warsaw, and by the age of 15 was in seminary. At the age of 17, he joined the Nazi Party. He later joined the Communist Party of Poland.  
 In 1930, after the Jewish worker-soldiers'uprising, he was arrested, but released once his sentence was reduced. In 1937 he was hired as a ( Polish ) telegraph operator by the German occupiers. In 1938, the war broke out, and the police tried to arrest him, but he escaped.  
 In 1940, he was recruited by Trotskyist forces to form the resistance group, Krakowskie Slednik. He was arrested on the Krakow-Rozawek border with Poland, and in 1944 he took part in one of the biggest attempts to stop the Allied Invasion of Poland. After the bombing of Warsaw, which was launched against the occupied city, Knik, along with many other prisoners, fled through the Toruń Pass to southern Poland.  
 He was then taken to the Soviet Union, but received anti-Jewish propaganda at the beginning of the Warsaw Uprising, he escaped and continued his work until the Soviet invasion of Poland in February 1945. Knik was executed by the Soviets on 9 December 1967.  
 Knik's last words, quoted by Yawning Heights ( 1989 ), were : `` Gedanken was, gleich weitere nicht selbst erscheint, das ist seinige Gegenwart hat er eigen, das liebe einer Teufel. Die Rücken auf die Horizontäre in der Zeit! '' ( `` This is our last tear of pride, from an independent camp! '' ).  
   
   
 == Quote ==  
 What did I say about the Jews? I said that we were all one nation... And let me prove it! Since Germany started bombing Poland, I don't see the Jews today! Now what about me? From now on I will never apologize for my position as an economist, because I will be the one to pay for it! The honest citizen will tell me, “ What are you planning for the future? Just a large bank, and then one will start in Warsaw, and things will happen, ” and I will say to him : “ I am very familiar with such plans! I have, actually, been working on them and ready for them, because now I have the chance! ” The Polish experience proves to me that if you stand up and fight it, you will come out clean, even on the Polish side. I am very familiar with such plans.

 = Walter A. Jeccu =  
Walter A. Jeccu ( October 17, 1921 – February 9, 2001 ) was an American physicist who was professor of theoretical physics at Yale University. He is known for his analysis of the CMB polarization of the subatomic region.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Jecchi was born in New York City to Brazilian and Dutch parents, and was the eldest of four children. When his father died at age thirty-eight, his mother inherited his inheritance, and upon their death, her will required that her children inherit the paternal estate. Her condition was deeply affected by war, and during her last illness she was nursed at home by a family friend who was still alive. The companion died on May 28, 1939. In 1940, Jecchi was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, and received a Ph.D. in 1941 under the supervision of Erwin Schrödinger. Jecchi was immediately employed at the Cavendish Laboratory, working with both then-unknown features of atomic structure, as well as the Planck–Rosen–Kepler law of gravitation, and pioneering methods for analyzing CMB polarization.  
 At Yale, Jecchi's studies led to theoretical work on the cosmic microwave background radiation, as well as the Enrico Fermi paradox, as well as theoretical investigations on the properties of subatomic particles. He received his Ph.D. in 1942 under the direction of Robert Millikan, in which the work was directed at the `` young high-energy protons '' as emitted from solar flares. Jecchi ’ s work focused on studying polarization in the CMB. For his doctoral thesis, he developed a method for the detection of very strong polarization, using an external rotating interference device. In his 1950 book ( PDF ), he argued that CMB polarization had what he termed an `` anomalous intrinsic pattern '' that favored observations of structural groupings, which he labeled “ electromagnetic sideshifts ”. Although the illusionary symmetry of light polarization did not have profound implications for cosmic particle physics, Jecchi believed it to be a problem that was “ worthy of careful study. ” In the 1960s, he used this research in a series of experiments on various “ outer-hemisphere phases ”, including the mesons of the hydrogen atom. During these experiments, he was unable to find the regions of polarization in the CMB that would permit the detection of CMB-formation.  
 In 1950, Jecchi moved to the Carnegie Institution of Washington ( CERN ) in Geneva, Switzerland, as professor of theoretical physics. Following an investigation of the CMB by J.D. Dreyfuss and J.J. Redding, he was elected a member of the American Physical Society in 1970. During his tenure at CERN, he carried out pioneering experiments on ionization X-ray and gamma-ray scattering in the medium-energy and high-energy regions of the CMB. In 1971, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. In 1988, he was an emeritus professor at Yale University. In 1999, he received the C.C. Spencer Award from the Max Planck Society.  
   
   
 == Honors and awards ==  
 Jecchi received the Cooper Clarke Medal in 1964, the Goethe Medal in 1971, the Gold Medal from the Royal Society of London, and the Albert C. Clarke Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1975.

 = Joseph Paul Reisz =  
Joseph Paul Reisz ( 25 December 1897, Strächfeld – 14 April 1989 ) was a German entomologist who specialized in Coleoptera. He is one of the best known Lepidopterists of his time and is best known for his genus Reiszella. The species he named are Ripsa reiszella ( 1929 ), Herryi reiszella ( 1944 ), and Tertiaryoptera reiszella, 1953. The Fauna Münchenia, a collection of 19 insects named in his honour by Weitzsch, contains 79 species. The species described by Reisz are among the longest-living Lepidoptera of all time and were collected by John Eaves, whose collections are held at the Zoological Museum of Manchester, where they have been in possession of the Zoological Museum since 1970.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Reisz was born in Strächfeld near Sarawak, then part of the Dutch East Indies. He studied mathematics, literature and zoology at the University of Hamburg and Berlin before earning his PhD from the University of Leipzig in 1929. His thesis research was on Dactylid butterflies.  
 Reisz started his career as a tutor in electrical engineering. In 1941 he became an entomologist at the Friedrich Wilhelm Friedrich University in Berlin and in 1943 was transferred to the Berlin Zoological Museum, where he worked for the next 27 years. Reisz specialized in Coleoptera, and wrote many important papers on Coleoptera and their locales. He was the first to describe the species Comorpha ripsae ( 1941 ), published in the Journal Entomol. His Coleoptera classification is based on being interested in male mating but also making copulations by insects.  
 After the war he began to do teaching and lecturing in entomology, first at the Friedrich Wilhelm Friedrich University in Berlin, then at the Hamburg University of Technology where he became professor in 1951. In 1953 he received his doctorate in Zoology from the University of Leipzig. He died in Berlin in 1989 and was buried in the Frankfurter Friedrich Ludwig Seeburgkirchen.

 = Robert David Girey =  
Robert David Girey ( 9 January 1916 – 22 February 2009 ) was an English cartographer, author, and historian.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Girey was born at Lewes, Surrey. He was educated at Peterhouse Grammar School and the Royal School of Mines and graduated in 1938. In 1941 he married Anne Frances Colquhoun, a psychologist and geography lecturer. After an extended period working as an RAF officer, he began as a lecturer in 1948 and taught geography at Dalkeith College, University of Cambridge. From 1952 to 1954 he was an assistant lecturer in art history at the University of Kent, and from 1954 to 1959 he was a lecturer in political science at the University of St Andrews. During this period he also lectured at Girton College, where he was named curator in 1959.  
 He began work on Girey's Atlas of The World in the late 1950s. A drawing of the Soviet Union was published the same year as his first printed book. That publication became the basis for his `` Perspectives of Geography '', in 1961. This second book brought into focus the long-standing `` sequence of world events '' concept, which still informs Girey's writings on world events, with all the elements of history occurring in successive sequential times. Girey also develops a dynamic metaphor, which applies to specific periods within a country, the paradigm for which he is the first to explain in his book.  
   
   
 == Historical Girey ==  
 In 1961 he was appointed Chief Historian at the Land Office, and a year later became the Curator of World Geography. His official title was then `` Chief Examiner of Records '', although as curator he was also `` Chairman of the National Planning Board ''. He was invited to the editorial boards of 16 national and international professional journals : the British Geographical Association, the Land and Oceanography and Geographic Survey Journal, the Royal Statistical Society, the London Geographic Association and the Royal Aeronautical Society. He also worked for the British Council and other institutions. From 1969 he was appointed Visiting Professor at the University of East Anglia. Girey wrote the book Notes on Wartime Latitudes, during which time he also provided detailed calculations for the geocentric expansion of the United Kingdom.  
 As chairman of the steering committee for the East Anglia Regional Council he was one of the founders of the East Anglia Geographical and Planning Council, and was tasked with `` managing the planning of East Anglia's extensive internal reserves. '' While at East Anglia Girey set up and headed a series of centres for Asia Studies at the University of London, which he oversaw from 1967 to 1974. The plan, called `` five'sites''', included Ananda University, with a research department focused on development, the Indian Institute of Geography, the Indian Institute of Science, the Geographical Research Institute ( GRI ), and the East Anglia Urban and Regional Research Institute ( EARRI ). The EARRI was the centre for regional development research, where Girey mentored the future historian Oliver Sacks. Girey's `` six sites '' were linked to the Chinese civil war, and covered Angkor Wat, Minchung, Pyongyang, Timurid North, Changsha and Beijing. While in Hong Kong he held a professorship in the history of China, specialising in the history of Chinese antiquity.  
 The artist John Barth designed Girey's research institute of East Anglia, and contributed artworks to his Atlas of The World. He was nominated for the National Geographical and Environmental-Natural History Museum ( NGEM ), after being one of the only six European thinkers to receive a Fellowship.

 = Bruno Coson (physicist) =  
Bruno Coson ( March 4, 1881 – January 16, 1955 ) was a Hungarian physicist and natural scientist. He received his doctorate in 1915 from the University of Vienna under Paul Ehrenfest.  
   
   
 == Background ==  
 Coson was born in Budapest. He studied physics and mathematics at the Technical University of Budapest and later worked at the Physics Institute of the University of Budapest. Coson was employed by the Government of Hungary in World War I as a physicist.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In World War II, Coson worked for the Second Airborne Division of the Hungarian Army. In the spring of 1945, he became the Director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics. He was awarded the National Medal of Science and Arts in 1947. In 1953, he became professor of the physical chemistry department of the Technische Hochschule für Wissenschaften and now the Hannoverische Hochschule für Technik.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
   
   
 === Economic issues ===  
 In the 1920s, he led the effort to turn physics into a science of both economic and public welfare. This is known as the Coson principle and it has led to reforms in such areas as the electric car, the life insurance scheme, and the social insurance and pensions plans.  
   
   
 === Political issues ===  
 Coson was the chair of the Communist Party. He defended the antisemitism of the dictatorship of Tito in Yugoslavia during World War II. He was also a dedicated Nazi activist who protested against the fascist `` racial register '' issued by the German states.  
 Coson was an early member of the Austrian People's Party. In 1930, the party asked for his help with the subsequent draft of a new constitution for Austria. The draft also was advocated by Coson's friend, the conservative philosopher Karl Hess. The parliamentary opposition in Austria took the absurd step of introducing a series of laws requiring anti-Semitism to be legally defined. In one, enacted in 1930, the term `` Fuhrer '' ( the president ) of Austria was defined as the head of state who chose the new Constitution, thus limiting Coson's role in the process.  
 In November 1930, Coson received a secret communication from Max Lidz, Nazi party leader and chairman of the Austrian Central Office, who promised to take over his department in a power vacuum. After two months of negotiations, Coson was presented as the candidate to succeed Lidz.  
 He resigned the chair of the Institute of Nuclear Physics, resigned his office and resigned his membership of the Federal Executive Council. In March 1933, for the first time, Austria lost its national elections. Lidz offered to resign for the good of his party and Coson declined the offer.For the postwar years, he was professor of physics at the ETH Zurich. Between 1940 and 1941, he was also president of the Austrian Society of Mechanical Engineers and from 1951 to 1953, he was chairman of the Institute of Nuclear Physics.  
 In June 1948, he and his wife, Elisabeth, emigrated to Canada where he became a professor of natural sciences at York University. His student Kapellmeister Stefan Schlick became a prominent radioamateur in Canada and subsequently worked as a professor of physics at the University of Toronto. He died in Guelph, Ontario.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 His outstanding research was in the fields of nuclear physics, physical chemistry, and radiochemistry. His achievements include the development of simple spectroscopy, the characterisation of crystalline nitrogen in ionospheres, the assimilation of nitrogen into carbon, and the atomic spectra of nuclei.

William Langhorne ( 1796–1855 ) was a British writer and naturalist. His books, including the first ( 1848 ) and third ( 1855 ) editions of The Naturalist's Companion, comprise a treasure trove of information on natural history and botany. Most of the works are illustrated with illustrations and numerous illustrations and footnotes.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Langhorne was born on 17 June 1796 in Oldham, Berkshire. His father was William Langhorne, member of the Jury and Coroner of Yorkshire, where his uncle, the Reverend Henry Whitestone, was deputy chaplain. Langhorne's uncle was professor of Natural History to King George VI at Whitehall. Langhorne's mother was Nelly, widow of Joshua I. They had four children.  
 His father, who was with him during the First and Second English Civil Wars, died in 1811, while William was seven years old. William was adopted by his maternal grandmother Margaret - who had no interest in children or relatives. They continued to live in the old Ludlow Avenue mansion, four miles ( 6.6 km ) east of the town of Oldham, next door to Oldham Castle.  
 Langhorne graduated from Woolwich High School in January 1811, and his education was interrupted by two years in the service of the 'South West Cantonment School'before he was a pupil at Bolton School in 1812. He then joined the Cadets'Company, under the command of George Preston. Langhorne went on to serve in Company A, 9th Cambridge Regiment, which fought in the First Anglo-Norman War of 1812. He then attended Maida Vale School, and entered the University of London as a student, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1815. He soon left for Dartmouth College, and remained there for the rest of his life.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Langhorne was a member of the 6th Company, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, was appointed secretary to the Colonial Council, and was President of Dartmouth College from 1817 to 1819. He also assisted by forming the first botanical club there, in 1818. In the 1830s, he began publishing monthly magazine Natural Journal, before becoming a notable writer, notably the Naturalist's Companion, which he continued until 1851. It comprises a collection of Charles Darwin's essays, collected from his books. The first 1848 edition contains all of his books, while the 3rd edition contains his own work on plants. Langhorne wrote editorials on science, such as the one published in The Naturalist's Companion, and also contributed books for children.  
 He had a heart attack at his home in Oldham in 1856. The author of the article he published entitled The Entire Life of William Henry Owen by Hever Francis Lee in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia published by the University of Pennsylvania, briefly described him as `` the most active man in East Anglia at the present time '', saying that his thoroughness as a writer may surpass that of any man, `` likely to occupy more space than any book written in the English language '', and that he is also noted for the `` powerful readership '' and `` rich variety '' of essays and notes he amassed in his editorship of Natural Journal.

William Salter ( April 22, 1813 – October 20, 1884 ) was an American naturalist, geologist and mineralogist. He was the only Smithsonian assistant curator in its first ten years, followed in a succession of notable predecessors beginning with Francis Clemens on 1841 and William Holley and František Lichtenstein on 1853.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Salter was born in East Bloomfield, Massachusetts. His father, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, was a noted coal prospector, and William also studied at Harvard College. Upon the recommendation of Willett, he entered Harvard University in 1847, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1849. Later in his life, he was a pupil at the Graduate School of Natural Philosophy at the University of Geneva.  
 Salter married Caroline ( Bell ) Jane Paton, a daughter of Boston merchant George Paton, on December 20, 1851. They had four children : Esther Paton, ( 1857–1885 ), Eliza Paton, ( 1858–1931 ), Henry Paton ( 1859–1926 ), and Sallie Paton ( 1859–1933 ).  
 Salter retired in 1873 to live in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, but soon returned to his scientific and geologic work.  
 Salter was the principal author of several important geological works and made a number of discoveries in the natural history of the Carolinas, especially along the Eastern coast, particularly the Charleston River and the Point Barrow area, from the Cape to the Chesapeake. Among these was the discovery of a range of fissures on the eastern shore of the Huron River. This led to the establishment of the Salter River region in 1876.In 1858 he joined the Smithsonian Institution at the age of twenty-one.  
   
   
 == Recognition ==  
 In 1854 he was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1860 was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London. He served as President of the Geological Society of America from 1862 to 1867, also serving as Vice-President and Honorary Secretary for the American Association of Mineralogists.

 His research focused on determining the surface energy of crystals and the field conservation of collision models. He demonstrated that the surface energy can be used as an indicator of the molecular weight, the metallographic atomic weight and the physical strength of a material. He also created several experimental prototypes and reported his results at international conferences. In this way he established the theory of statistical physics and, through his mathematical models, further demonstrated the existence of relationships among the properties of materials.  
 In 1953, he co-founded the Brazilian Mathematical Institute ( BMI ).  
 On 18 May 1965 he was made a Foreign Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in India and received an honorary Doctorate degree from the University of São Paulo.

 = Thomas Carr (political scientist) =  
Thomas Carr ( 9 April 1779 – 17 June 1831 ) was a British academic and politician.  
 Born at London, Carr was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he gained an MA in 1793.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was a moderate, peace-loving and Protestant evangelical minister in London's South Kensington section. As a deputy to the first cabinet ( 1796–1802 ), he was one of the commissioners who advised a royal commission that proposed the abolition of barter. Carr was its co-author. He had also a popular legal defence, when he was accused by George Lee of stirring up trouble in the Yorkshire border by claiming that it constituted land for agriculture and rural development. Carr had the advantage of advancing the cause with the exception of William Middleton, which effectively meant a divorce from the Presbyterian church and much of the British intellectual and political establishment.

 = Dorothy Kaurek =  
Dorothy Marie Kaurek ( December 23, 1872 – November 14, 1961 ) was an American entomologist known for her studies of centipedes and lice, her contributions to the observation and description of the term `` crabs '' in the natural sciences and for her research in the field of parasitology. She was the first woman and the first woman physician in Pennsylvania and the first to become a professor of parasitology in the United States at the University of Pennsylvania in 1913.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Dorothy Kaurek was born to Christine Catherine Lowrey on December 23, 1872, and was the oldest child of her parents, the poet and teacher Mary Taylor Kaurek ( 1819–1900 ), and her older sister Ida Mae Taylor Lowrey ( 1844–1913 ). Dorothy married Henry Allen Kaurek on September 18, 1881. They had three sons : Lawrence ( 1882-1961 ), Donald ( 1890-1935 ) and Darlene ( 1898-1953 ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Dorothy was a regular student of botany at Pennsylvania College, and then pursued a position teaching biology at Oberlin College in Ohio before returning to PA College in 1895, where she joined the teaching faculty and opened a full-time course in insect ecology. In 1898, she was awarded a master's degree in zoology from Oberlin College, and became a doctor of botany with the degree in 1901. She taught classes in biology and zoology for four years at Oberlin College. In the summer of 1911, Dorothy Kaurek graduated as first woman of color to receive a doctorate in biology at Oberlin. She was promoted to associate professor, and taught two additional years at Oberlin. Between the years 1902 and 1909, Dorothy Kaurek served as a university lecturer and as a member of the department of biological sciences. She chaired the biological investigations committee of the Pennsylvania State Entomological Society and was one of the five women to serve as president of the Society for Experimental Biology, the international scientific organization for comparative anatomy. After the dissolution of the Society in 1911, she became president of the Pennsylvania Entomological Society. She was an annual recipient of the Frederic A. Stotz Award for her professional achievements in biology.During World War I, Kaurek was a conscientious objector. When she returned to the United States in 1922, she moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and resumed teaching biology there, but she later returned to PA and opened a practice in Philadelphia. In 1925, Dorothy Kaurek was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in scientific studies of beetles, and founded a course in parasitology for students and professionals in that subject.  
   
   
 == Life as a scientist ==  
   
   
 === Research ===  
 In her research, Kaurek focused on the life history of Centipedeidae and Lepidoptera. When she became the first woman in the country to be awarded a doctorate in her biological field, she was joined in her career by two colleagues, the entomologist and parasitologist Irving Berlin ( 1858–1941 ) and the entomologist and teacher Dr. Joseph Glass ( 1860–1954 ). While working with Berlin, the pair of them combined knowledge of experimental zoology and parasitology to identify new terms in biology, and sought to use these terms as means of educating the general public in that area. Although Kaurek began her career as a botanical entomologist, she did her pioneering work in the field of parasitology as a biology lecturer and scientific reporter.  
 Kaurek's first publication, published in the Journal of the Pennsylvania Entomological Society ( 1901 ), contained a small selection of concepts and definitions for the specific names of new invertebrate taxa.  
   
   
 === Later life ===  
 Following her doctoral degree, Kaurek taught botany at Oberlin College for twenty years and became a professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1913. She remained there until her retirement in 1947. She served as one of the trustees of the Pennsylvania Entomological Society from 1935 to 1943. In 1943, she received the Helen Peterson Cole Award from the American Entomological Society. She died in Philadelphia at the age of ninety-one. She was the daughter of American poet and teacher Darlene Maria ( Walker ) Lowrey.

 = Henry E. Grant =  
Henry E. Grant ( December 18, 1930 – August 25, 2006 ) was an American environmental historian who founded and directed the Department of Comparative Environmental Studies ( CEDS ) at Harvard University, whose `` Meteorological Investigations for the Northwestern Adirondacks '' was a standard source of research on Arctic forest and its ecology for the entire United States. In 1976, the CEDS Institute at Harvard University was renamed the Geophysical Laboratory.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Grant was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the second of four children of Merritt and Wessie Grant. The younger of the two boys, Henry became a student in the meteorology department at University of Minnesota, where he later received his B.S. in 1955. During his undergraduate years, he was in part the first to record the temperature of every Minnesota storm in depth-borough charts and with Robert Rudner. He earned his Master's in meteorology from Pennsylvania State University in 1961. While a graduate student he also studied the geographic patterns of boundary layer cold-air circulation, taking the annual instrumental record of the annual northern flow of air in mid-latitude basins. He was the main author of the 1982 book Climatic Research in the Northwestern Adirondacks ( now CEDS International ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Grant worked as an adjunct professor at New York University, graduating as the Ray F. Powell Lecturer in 1948 and then later a visiting professor of meteorology and environmental geography at the Harvard Extension School. He became an associate professor at New York University in 1957 and was assistant director of the National Climate Center in 1966. Grant also served as the Dean of New York University's Department of Geography in 1974, and later as the first provost of Harvard University.  
   
   
 == Retirement ==  
 In 1991, Grant retired from Harvard. A year later, he was a Visiting Professor of Geography at Harvard University's Stern School of Business, where he gave lectures on sustainability of economies and politics, climate change, and the history of scientific and academic study. In 1999 he delivered the George Eastman Award to study the geomagnetism of the Atlantic Ocean.Grant died of a heart attack on August 25, 2006, at his home in Harvard Yard, aged 93. The weather historian David Simon, in his book Killing Time : The Forgotten Art of Declining the Weather, described Grant as `` one of the great national environmental explorers '' and as `` a scientist with a laser focus on ancient knowledge, and a fine opinion of geography ''.  
   
   
 == CEDS ==  
 Grant's renowned 1978 book Climatic Research in the Northwestern Adirondacks ( now CEDS International ) was a landmark account of the history of the atmospheric sciences and geography as well as the importance of survey methods in climatological investigations. He was the co-author of one of the original 32 chapters, and the nature editor of three more. After reviewing 120 articles, many of them of particular interest to scientists and policy makers, Grant left them to several colleagues and conducted a complementary study. In his journal article `` Contributions of Reference Aerosol '', Grant wrote : `` the meteorological survey field program of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) includes a cloud and precipitation survey of the western United States.... [ the Mapp land-fog and cross section studies ] explore large land areas without visibility or consistent sky conditions. It should be possible to extract observations suitable for use in spatial descriptive climatology. ''

Sir Sidney Adkinson ( 1868–1932 ) was an American mycologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Adkinson studied at Cornell University and Harvard Medical School and obtained his M.D. in 1916. His work included various subspecies of Trichoderma and the orthopteran Ascomycetes, being part of an earlier, large-scale effort that included the ornithologist G.S. Coombes. In addition to his scientific work, Adkinson was a prolific writer. He wrote five volumes on insect taxonomy ( 1920–1934 ), contributing to `` Today's Mycological Review '' and `` American Insects ''.  
 He described over 800 new genera and species, and around 150 new species. He collected over 700,000 new specimens and made his first over 800 films. In addition, the paper still preserved and stored in the Woodlands museum, the Gardens of the Eastwood Institute at Cornell University, was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art ( 2001 ).  
 Adkinson's taxonomic interpretations, especially of the tiny polypae of the Asteraceae family, or of the `` primers '' or `` extensions '' that span the species range of a genus were highly influential in the art of mycology.He died of pleurisy in 1936 in Woodlands, NJ.

 == Early life ==  
 Boettgeria Beca was born in Bresławowice. After spending one year as a private teacher, she settled in an estate in Amerika.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 For over ten years she practised as a naturalist and botanist in Bresławowice, before entering a new profession in 1899. After a voyage with Frederick William Wheldon and the royal family in the North Atlantic Ocean, in 1903, she returned to Bresławowice to teach her son, Josef Beca. Josef graduated in 1908.  
 She took an active part in the conservation of many mammals such as the elk, that are now endangered. She wrote to the Polish author Nikolaj Fabianowicz in order to let his work to be published in London. In 1918, in her old age, she sent back her collected eggs for restoration in Bonn.  
 During the years 1920-1924, Beca contributed the mathematical explanations to Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. She and her husband were required to pay for mistakes during the history of Polish archeology in Bresławowice. Beca then retired in Bresławowice, but also became a favourite with the local people, who would spend their holidays walking on her behalf. The local people would fly home with the eggs, and arrange for them to be ready to be sent back to Poland for transplanting into new habitats. Following her retirement from Bresławowice, she died on 13 January 1924 at age 91, in Meimar, in northern Germany. Her ashes were interred at the Dr. Franz-Josef-Strasse funeral village in Bonn.

Albert Ferrand ( 22 October 1664 – 21 December 1701 ) was a French danseur and 19th-century master, famous as a philosopher and a pioneering participant in the French Revolution.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Ferrand was born in Riga, the son of a physician, into a village community of Romanian Huguenot descent. He was the son of a peasant family which tended to live far from the main source of income to produce clothes for their own families and for the exchange of goods among local merchants and traders. The family went through a long period of difficulty and passed from town to town to acquire, customarily, small plot land from farmers. The farming community in Riga was greatly dependent on the kindness of relatives and friendly acquaintances, for which the Ferrands were especially grateful. In 1689, Ferrand was summoned to attend medical school and obtained an acceptance in the Faculty of Medicine at the age of 18.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1690, Ferrand began his lecture-university studies in philosophy. He became a professor of philosophical sciences in Paris, but left to take part in the Paris Commune on 30 October 1706. He later became the president of the Académie des sciences. In 1803, Ferrand helped to organise the first congress of French philosophers in Geneva. He resigned his post in 1706 due to ill health, and died in Paris on 21 December 1701. His published works, completed at the age of fifty-seven, include An Essay on the Principle of Threefold Diversity of Logical Forms and the Foundations of Philosophical Science.

 === Career ===  
 In 1859, White worked at St Kilda's Hospital, London. He was appointed as an assistant to William Gurney at the Somerville Hospital in 1866. White undertook further studies at the Bristol General Hospital from 1865 to 1867. After a tour of Italy in 1868, White returned to London to work as a medical examiner, before serving for the next four years at Grenfell's Hospital, where he was also the junior practitioner. In 1873 he was called to teach in the Medical Institute of Surgeons at Stockport, London, and two years later moved to Edinburgh, being in charge of New College Hospital there, graduating there in 1876. White was chosen to teach obstetrics and gynaecology at St Mary's Hospital in Edinburgh in 1883.  
 In the early 1880s, White was a member of a team of anatomy students from London University which included Maria Sarah Stewart, who became world-famous for her drawings of the human skeleton. These original sketches and their commentary on anatomy and physiology caused a sensation and White was invited to lecture on the topic of anatomy for the College of Surgeons.His reputation as a lecturer grew and the general public were impressed by his knowledge and good work. In addition, John D. Dalton, a former pupil and teacher at St Kilda's Hospital, made arrangements for the use of his rooms at Stockport by White, who included a library of anatomical papers, drawings and notes. From 1885 to 1889, White was President of the Edinburgh Zoological Society. In 1886, he was appointed Acting Chief of the Department of Anatomy at St Mary's Hospital. In 1887, the Medical and Surgical Laboratory at Stockport was constructed, and the following year the Institute, where White worked, was extended.  
 He moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1890, and in 1896 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died at his home in Stockport on 6 March 1913. He is buried in the graveyard of the Chapel of St Margaret ’ s, Stockport.

 = Christiane Courland =  
Christiane Courland ( 3 February 1853, Pôraze, French Guiana – 29 June 1920, Leonstam ) was a composer and teacher. She was born in Pôraze, French Guiana, and died in Leonstam, Bavaria, aged 66.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Courland studied composition under Isidor Goldschmidt at the Freiberg Conservatory, but became more interested in experimental music at the age of 20. In 1881, she entered the Neukirchen Westwindschaft ( German Westwindschaft ) as a music teacher and quickly found herself involved with early experimentalism, including Impressionism, Adolphe Viardot and Reverberations.  
 She and her husband were considered quite at home together. Courland's father, Andrez Courland, was an accomplished engineer and mathematics professor, while her mother Luise was a concert pianist. They encouraged Courland in the use of the piano, but were probably better acquainted with the art of conducting, who would conduct and communicate with her at her home.  
 She is best known for the symphonic work Der Kapellmeister, Op. 20, Op. 39, Op. 50 ( a collaboration with Joseph Bonnet ), the fourth piano concerto in Kleiner Künste. The organ concerto and the eleven-movement Págoro intermezzi is her most widely known work. The Scheherazade concludes the suite, the last movement of which is the Motet. She also wrote two shorter pieces for the piano, the first of which, The Pelican Soliloquy, for violin and piano, was performed in 1905 at the time of her death.

Piotr Stanisław Kraszewski ( 28 February 1914 – 17 August 1991 ) was a Polish mathematician. He also did applied research on power series, simple harmonic functions, trigonometric functions, diffraction gratings, and the propagation of optical waves. He was one of the organizers of the August 1991 Polish presidential election, which led to the centrist and liberal formation of a coalition government. In 1992, he was awarded a statue by the Władysław Mazurkiewicz Prize in recognition of his long contribution to Polish mathematics.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 He was born in Siebenberg, Zlięc, Kraków Governorate, but when he was twelve years old moved to Lwów. He was a student of Kościuszko-Janowski from 1908 until his graduation in 1912. Kraszewski graduated from the University of Lwów in 1920, and in 1921 he joined the Lwów Mathematical Faculty ( now the Elementary Mathematics Department of the Lwów University, Faculty of Science ) and in 1932 took his doctorate from the University of Warsaw. In 1937, he was appointed professor of the Lwów University.From 1943 to 1945 he served as Director of the Institute for Elementary Applications of Physics ( ILEpF ) in Lwów. From 1945 to 1947, he served as Visiting Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Free Hospital ( founded by King Leopold VII, and renamed Gdańsk in 1948, to commemorate the University of Gdańsk which was founded by Ferdinand I ). From 1948 to 1951 he was Visiting Professor at the University of Ljubljana ( as well as serving as a visiting professor at São Paulo State University ).

From 1966 to 1971, he served as a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences ( SNY ).  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1927, Kraszewski published his book The Theory of Bezier Curves. In 1939, he developed another set of famous Bezier curves, which were later a cornerstone of cosmology, hydrodynamics, and time series. These worked from a third-order problem. He died in Lwów, but his ideas, despite their basic nature, are still heavily used in research.  
   
   
 === Transformations ===  
 The units of Kraszewski's transformations are the transversals ( ω -π ), the extenders ( π -πt ), and the extenders of the three new methods are the theta functions ( ν-ξ, ξ-ξt ).He introduced transversals in 1923, and they now form the basis of all theorems of heta functions. These were also the first basis of the base-theta function. The Averrett–Karcher-Eurowitz theorem for determining the scalar acceleration of light is a classic example of a transform

 = William White (philosopher) =  
William White, CBE ( 19 October 1819 – 21 May 1894 ) was an English biochemist, Nobel laureate and statistician, and founder of the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ).  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 William White was born at the Manor Inn, Brighton, the son of a chemist. He studied at Balliol College and studied medicine at University College, Bristol. In 1848 he was appointed to the staff of Lord Dunmore, who, with the assistance of the chemist John Richard Green, was managing medical affairs of the various branches of the Royal Household in England. White was appointed to the Lord Blackburn Family Board in 1852. In 1850 he became Secretary of the Royal Microscopical Society. From the year 1851 to 1857 White was acting Scientific Advisor for Great Britain, succeeding Brougham Stuart as Director of the British Chemical Research Establishment. White was Director of the Institute of Chemistry for many years, retiring in 1900. In 1866, as Vice-President of the Royal Society, he developed the correlation function, a numerical measure of a particle's frequency, which was the first known indicator of movement and velocity in nature.  
 In 1869, when known as `` Sir William White '', he represented Great Britain on the commission appointed to find an annual balance for the International Bureau of Standards ( IBS ). During the second world war White remained in the job of Director of the IBS, making several attempts to enlist the services of others. In 1944, White retired from the chemical service, and later became the official statistician for the WMO.  
 The bacterium Bacillus Whitei is named after him.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Son of S. White, CBE, the writer on science and arts, appointed statistician, has been described as the `` first English biochemist ''. White was an early advocate of the scientific method and a key contributor to the creation of the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ). He was a member of the National Science Board of WMO, the governing body for the program of technical training and scientific education for scientists and engineers. He drafted the Three Hundred and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1871 and served as its first Secretary from 1872 to 1876. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871, and in 1876 he was elected the ninth President of the society.  
 In 1871, White edited the first technical survey of microscopic systems for the Statistical Office, subsequently known as the Waterproofing Office. His understanding of statistical statistics and their application were developed by John Joseph Rennard, president of the Waterproofing Office, and the Great Britain Botanical Garden. In 1873 he submitted a paper on `` Precious compounds, their potential excreta '', to the British Journal of Science. White worked on the comparative study of insecticides to determine their effectiveness. In 1877, with his student Francis Weston, White published a report on the statistics of sugar isomers ( sugar families ), the usefulness of which had been largely overlooked.

 = Jack Sloman =  
Jack Sloman ( March 15, 1871 – July 25, 1949 ) was a New York City civil engineer, foreman and author. He became well known after his essay `` A New Bayou in a Land Moved by Private Vessels '' in which he detailed numerous ways in which private enterprise could improve public service and the quality of life in New York City.Sloman served on the commission of the United States Commission on Shore Roads from 1895 to 1898, the department of New York from 1903 to 1907, and was a member of the New York City Board of Health. In 1917, Sloman became a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering.  
   
   
 == Background ==  
 Born in Bexar County, Texas, Sloman was a son of William Sloman ( 1844-1902 ), of Marigold, Texas, and Martha Sloman, née Marcus ( d. 1909 ). His grandfather was Jesse Marcus of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  
 After graduating from Westview High School, Sloman transferred to Harvard College in 1892. While still a student he began work as an insurance agent for the First Federal Insurance Company, serving there as a foreman in the 1870s, and then, in 1873, at the newly opened office of Westinghouse Electric Company. After getting out of the insurance business he moved to New York to work for the First Consolidated Railroad until a few months before the company was destroyed by fire.  
   
   
 == Professional Background ==  
 Sloman was born into a family of engineering professionals who had gone through seven generations of engineers. His father was Jesse Marcus. A descendant of 18th-century preachers John Allen and Mary Ann Lee, Sloman was also the third and youngest son of Jesse Marcus of Wharton, Pennsylvania. Sloman wrote for the New York Gazette, the New York Evening Post, the New York Herald Tribune, the Civilian Review, and other publications.  
 Sloman married the former Alice Buck, of New York City, in 1893. Their son, Tom Sloman, was raised in Berkeley, California, and is now an author of poetry and a professor of English at the City University of New York.In 1891 Sloman published `` Two Characters of Civil Engineers '' and followed with his best-known essay `` A New Bayou in a Land Moved by Private Vessels ''. With the exception of a short article on the Elmira school that appeared in the Los Angeles City Journal in 1904, the rest of his work was based on similar material published in other publications, mainly by Anderson. The essay was so well known that the Department of Public works commissioned Sloman to prepare a pamphlet in support of its study on the railroad and its potential value. However, the report never came to completion. After the passage of the Railroad Decade Act of 1897 and passage of the Rail Link Act of 1901, many of the policies of former Governor Charles Van Buren and the federal government began to reflect their views about the public sector. Consequently, proposals of improvement in the state and federal governments began to come from state, state and federal governments. Sloman decided that the public sector might benefit from some assistance. He had been advocating the creation of a state-sponsored industrial laboratory, later renamed the State Engineering Laboratories, to train the public sector. A proposal for a $ 1,500 yearly stipend to support a staff of 22 persons would be initially sent to the Legislature. However, the experimental stations were closed down in 1904, and he was not able to secure the financial assistance he needed. This setback ultimately led Sloman to set out for New Orleans, Louisiana, where he would finally publish his best-known work, New Orleans : An American City on October 13, 1903.

 = Lennard Ellwyn =  
Lennard Ellwyn FRS ( 23 April 1887 – 20 December 1981 ) was a British statistician who was Chairman of the Statistics Division of the Department of Agriculture. He was one of the main developers of the 1919 Census. He was one of the founders of the Australian Biometric Standards Association in 1954 and was appointed Professor of Statistics at the University of Melbourne in 1968. He was on the editorial board of the Australian Journal of Biometry, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society and the Journal of Biometrics. He was the Chairman of the Department of Statistics from 1929 to 1940, and Chairman of the Department of Agriculture from 1940 to 1945. He retired in 1946.  
   
   
 == Background and career ==  
   
 Lennard Ellwyn was born in London in 1887. He attended the Victoria Girls'College, St Marys College, Oundle and the University of Edinburgh. He was educated at Edinburgh, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912, and became a Fellow of the University of Edinburgh in 1915. After serving as an Officer in the Royal Navy he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1920. He then gained his Masters of Science degree from Cambridge University in 1923, and his PhD from University of Reading in 1924.  
 In 1928, Ellwyn married Katharine Marsden-Ellwyn. Their son Martin was born in 1924. They had two sons, William and Alex.  
 In 1927, Ellwyn married Margaret Hinton. Their son Michael was born in 1933.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 In 1919, the Census of Population was instituted in Great Britain. In 1921, the Census of Wales was instituted, this time in England. In 1931, the Census of Ireland was instituted in Ireland. In 1948, the Census of England was instituted. In 1953, the Population Survey was established as a subsidiary of the Division of Statistics of the Department of Agriculture. The largest part of his work was the so-called Ellwyn Regression Model, a statistical technique for estimating the effect of population changes. In this analysis, he examined how the amount of industrial growth depended on both the distribution and the characteristics of various human activities. The end result was the Ellwyn Regression Model.Lennard Ellwyn became Chairman of the Statistics Division of the Department of Agriculture, and was appointed Professor of Statistics at the University of Melbourne in 1968.  
 He was one of the main developers of the 1919 Census, taking the survey and modeling how people came to live in the UK. He developed the Study of Hong Kong's Population Question, for which he worked with Matthew Townsend, in 1928 and 1929. Also, Ellwyn's statistical forecasts were used for early development assessments of many UK tax and welfare policies. This work also influenced the introduction of the QFV Scheme, used to remove opportunities for overwork to children with early learning disabilities.In 1932, he published the statistical data needed to start the Adequacy Methodology for evaluation of the causes of unemployment. This approach is now generally referred to as the `` Ellwyn method '', and is currently used for similar determinations by various governments.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 On 28 July 1914, Lennard Ellwyn married Katharine Marsden-Ellwyn. They had one son Martin ( born 1937 ) and a daughter Ann ( born 1943 ). He died on 20 December 1981, at the age of 82, of colon cancer.

 = Michael Cargill (mathematician) =  
Michael Cargill FRS ( 1 October 1900 – 22 April 1973 ) was a British economist and statistician. He was an expert on industrial organization, government and trade policy, and economics.Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Cargill attended the University of Edinburgh earning a Bachelor of Science ( BA ) in 1921, M.Sc. ( 1922 ) in statistics, and a Master of Arts ( M.A. ) in 1927. He was awarded his PhD from the University of Liverpool in 1928 and returned to Britain as an M.Sc. student in 1934.  
 Cargill became Chief Economist at the Industrial Relations Board ( IBRB ) in 1931, appointed then as Principal to the House of Lords and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947. His Copley Medal of the Society of Economic Actuaries awarded for his research into the economics of employment provided evidence that government was under-reacting to the conditions of industrial decline, and subsequently Cargill became rector of St George's College. Cargill was Reader in Economic Statistics at the University of Oxford ( 1939 ), and fellow at the University of California, Berkeley ( 1946 ).He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1946, and an Honorary Fellow in 1962, the prestigious accolade which he received in 1964. Cargill was also the first British representative to address the Joint Economic Committee of the World Economic Outlook Conference held in Copenhagen. Cargill's research was also employed in establishing the policy research unit of the British council on international economic relations.In 1948, he became a professor of economics and statistics at the London School of Economics, where he remained until his retirement in 1973. He was a founder and president of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) from 1950 to 1952 and later served on the advisory committee.

 The Cargill Medal of the International Economic Commission, and the Commander's Cross of the Order of the British Empire ( 1968 ) are named in his honour.  
   
   
 == Research contributions ==  
 Cargill has contributed to the research of labour market methodology and competition, and to monetary theory. His work on stock prices has been important in showing the social implications of a stable-state monetary policy, although he stresses that he was not an economist. He also was the first to demonstrate the association between changes in company size and changes in labour supply during an economic downturn.  
   
   
 == Political activity ==  
 Cargill served as a member of several British government bodies, including the Council of State and as an MP for Heverley in Northern Ireland, being elected in the 1970 constituency.

 = Heber Wright =  
Hermann Heinrich Heber Wright, also known by the alias B.J. Wright, ( April 4, 1928 – May 18, 1999 ) was a microbiologist and geneticist known for his work in the area of immunology, particularly anti-retroviral medicine.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Wright was born to Christian B. and Esther Gertrude ( née Harnack ) Wright, a housewife, in Malmö, Sweden. His parents, both missionaries, were from a family of Anglican immigrants. He was educated at the seminary there, where he received the degree of licentiate in 1930 and the doctorate in 1936.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After his PhD in Medicine he worked in the Växjö Pharmaceuticals company as an assistant.He returned to the United States in 1934 to teach at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1941 he moved to CRI Research Laboratory in Pekin, Minnesota, where he worked on antibody screening. He returned to the United States in 1946 as a professor of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology at Colorado State University and, in 1950, was a Professor of Pathology at UC San Diego, where he was rector. In the years following World War II, he was `` authorized to perform laboratory research in any laboratory with material relevant to immunology and published over 150 scientific papers. '' For the past five decades he also worked at the United States Department of Agriculture's Johnson School of Agriculture and Medical Research. Wright was known for developing antibodies against HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ), and trachoma pneumoniae in a series of studies that were later shown to be effective. In 1951, Wright received the Roger and Helen Arnold Ruth Clark Prize from the National Academy of Sciences. He was director of the Werner Waldorf Biological Laboratories in Denmark from 1974 to 1975.The vertebrate immunodeficiency virus ( VILV ) infects humans through the blood of cattle and humans ; antibodies to the virus have shown promise for treating it in people. This has been an important application of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ), which has been targeted by antiviral drugs. The correct antibodies are now known to cause viral persistence and are still the standard of care in the first year of therapy.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Heber Wright married Ruth Emerson Margaret Arthur June Carr in 1939. They had one son and two daughters.

Jacques Éidelman ( 31 May 1899 – 13 August 1974 ) was a French biochemist who pioneered the study of protein metabolism.  
 He was born in Pau, and his academic background was in biochemistry at the Polytechnic Institute in Paris. At the Sorbonne he received his B.Sc. in 1923, his Ph.D. in 1925 under the supervision of Élie Lefebvre.  
 In 1937 he received his habilitation from the Paris Polytechnic. The next year he was appointed assistant professor and later professor at the Paris Institut Pasteur.  
   
   
 == Early life and work ==  
 Édouard Sarré, in his book Le Biographie de la metabolism ( `` Biography of the metabolism of proteins '', 1897 ), gave Édouard Sarré the credit for popularising the concept of a particular amino acid.  
 The important synthesis by the Édouard Sarré of a protein compound, with modification of the parent substance, gives a program ( E. Sarré ) ( see Ed. for a fuller description of Sarré's synthesis ), ( s ) is considered E.Sarré's result.  
 Histo-histochemistry has since become the most widely used form of experimental histochemistry. The concept of the alkaline phosphatase ( the physiochemical method of culture ).  
 Most of the best known laboratories of bio-technological research are now devoted to the development of technology and methods of chemical control of chemical reactions. Biochemists in many countries are determined to secure control of the results of such research.  
 In spite of this research being of great importance for chemistry as well as for physiological research, it still has to wait for a great synthesis, also from a French chemist. In 1948 Jacques Éidelman co-founded the `` Édouard Sarré ’ s Group '' at the Paris Polytechnic in which he endowed the final position in the research program, which began from 1951 until his death.

 == Biography ==  
 Claude Provencio was born on 11 April 1883 in Paris. His mother died when he was only a month old. In 1900, Claude left his father's home at 200 Rivalres to go to university in Nice, where he studied mathematics and physics. He did not succeed in his studies and eventually dropped out.In 1910, he took the position of junior teacher in the teaching college of the Natural History Museum in Lyon. In 1913, he became a professorial assistant at the Physiologique, a professorial position he held until 1925, when he started his research for his Ph.D. in physics.  
 In 1917, he won a place in the Physics Department of the École Normale Supérieure at the Collège de France. Two years later, he became a full professor, serving until 1933. His main contributions were for the determination of the phase of light.  
 In 1936, he started a paper on `` Cradle Photons '', but refused to submit it because of conflicts with the research department. In 1938, he created his own name and set out the `` Claude-Joseph Provencio '' that he used as his surname, except that now he used `` Provencio '' as his surname.Provencio believed that various lineages of stars contained protons, and discovered a photodetecting formula for the fundamental abundance of protons in a star. This was known as `` Pierre Solé '' in the 1940s, in English as `` Pierre of Solé '', but was finally renamed as `` Claude-Joseph Provencio '' and simplified and generalized in his Ph.D. thesis.Claude Provencio received several prizes, including the Honorary Director of the National Institute of Radio and TV in 1929.

John Judson CBE ( 31 May 1890 – 23 December 1973 ) was a pioneer in global warming analysis.  
 Judson was born in Purcell, Essex. He worked with John Eden, Mike Delus, Murray Gell-Mann, Alfredo Coates, Cecil Rhodes, Sir Harold Schuman, Frank A. Stent, Cargill Kirkwood, William Chisholm, Hubert Lambert, and Paul Harvey. He left the International Panel on Climate Change to enter the Bell Labs, where he led a team that showed the conservative-enhanced predictions of the IPCC's 1998 report to be wrong. His major contribution was to show that the missing input from atmospheric circulation was the infrared radiation reaching the tropics, which scientists thought would be brought down by anthropogenic aerosols. This was the first known demonstration that the most plausible climate scenario was indeed the negative feedback effect of anthropogenic aerosols.  
 Judson received the Karl Peierls Prize, which recognizes technical excellence in certain fields of science.

 = Oskar Windisch =  
Oskar Windisch ( 12 December 1748 – 16 February 1837 ) was a Czech mathematician who made fundamental contributions in the analysis of the equations of motion of air and of metals, derived the finest formalized calculus of variations and was instrumental in determining the electronic voltages in the late 18th century. His work is noteworthy not only for his mathematical accomplishments but also for his social and philosophical beliefs.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Windisch was born in Tancred, in today's Czech Republic. He had his early education in his hometown. His family left Tancred after his father died in 1768. This led to many years of living in local towns where Windisch found employment working as an apprentice before returning to the city. He enrolled in the Gymnasium ( School ) of the Bolshoi but chose to continue at Stendal when it became available. During this time, he decided to study abroad in order to obtain his degree.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
 After completing his doctorate, he was a lecturer at the University of Prague for a few years before becoming a full professor in 1818. From 1825 he was director of the Institute for Theoretical Mechanics. He began to focus his efforts on the analysis of gases. In 1826, he published his definitive paper on the Leibnizian Principle of Formal Equations of Motion ( 1862 ). However, these results can be considered as the foundation for the geometric calculus of variations and the geometrical mechanics of compounds. After World War II, however, he returned to the University as a faculty member, where he was instrumental in publishing the development of the theoretical development of the electrochemical system, introduced in 1919 by Professor Mošilov, into the curriculum. He was later elected President of the Academy in 1950.  
   
   
 == Inartistic works ==  
 Windisch is best known for his 1910 publication ‘ On the Non-Stretching Collisions of the Media in Open or Closed Spaces ”. This paper, an anatomical result from construction problems, addresses the popular misconception that the movements of mass in an open space are caused by `` most intense compression '' by collisions between the spaces within. It posits the existence of a region of discontinuity, called the ‘ collapsed ’ area, which is outside the action potentials of the closed space.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Windisch's son, Josef Windisch, was a physician, the nephew of the famous physician-general Aukerman and the uncle of Czesław Aikin.His daughter, Anne, was an art historian. She married the economist Ilia Wibowo, in 1910.  
   
   
 == Other life ==  
 Windisch retired to Prague and died in 1837, at the age of 47.

 In 1696, she collected specimens from the extensive orogeny of Lake Olbricht in North West Germany, at the time a densely forested and boreal massif.  
 In the same year, she described several new species of extinct mammoths.  
 She served in the Swedish lands and claimed to have discovered and described prehistoric human remains in the middle of an ice-bound landmass ( now in southeastern Alaska ).  
 She was instrumental in preserving the north-west German climate in the 1690s, especially during the Ice Age.  
   
   
 == Military service ==  
 In 1697, she joined the Royal Danish Navy.  
 In 1705, she was the captain of a submarine that sailed down the Hutton Strait with Louis de Quatre, arriving on the island of St Andrews. There, they laid out camp in an ice-cap station called Bienland. When its winter of 1697 ended, it was discovered that the hut they had been occupying was actually trapped in a tub below, holding the ice shell of a baby elephant. It was said to have been eight years since his birth. This animal's mother had died, so Tupperus became the head of the ice-captainship.  
 At the beginning of the 1698 Anglo-Danish War, Marie Tupperus was one of three women ( the other two being Glendinning and Glendringer ) present at a small Scandinavian victory parade in New York when Danish troops crossed into North America. After the event, during her military career, Tupperus claimed to have discovered and described prehistoric human remains in the middle of an ice-cap station called Bienland.During the same war, she led an expedition in search of Alexander von Humboldt. During this trip, she discovered and named the fern genus Plectenia. In 1710, she was the woman chosen to be president of the Scandinavian Company, the world's oldest trading company. She was also the first woman named to be a governor of Northern Norway and a member of the Norwegian parliament from 1712 to 1718.

 A request for media information on Davis was sent to Dr. Joshua Graham Brown, president of the American Society for Microbiology, in 2005. Brown asked if the current campaign to rename the Asia Pacific Branch of the American Institute of Physiology and Medicine `` of Asian ancestry '' was a `` bit much '', and Brown provided Davis'personal measurements ( 5 ft 9 in, 155 pounds ), medical documentation ( one year in the 1950s and early 1960s for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and prostate cancer, one year in the early 1960s for polycythemia vera ), and a variation of Davis'birthday :  
   
 A request for information on the terms `` Japanese '' and `` Korean '' was sent to Dr. Donald E. Hill in 2003. Hill replied in a letter that neither term is used in Korean and that to use the terms is `` simply nonsense and offensive to Koreans ''.Hill also provided historical references and additional information on Davis. Hill wrote that there is currently `` evidence to suggest that Davis suffered from Aspergillosis that is an inherited chronic condition... which continued to impair his neurologic and reflexology abilities to the point of his death. ``

Wilhelm Esslinger ( 17 June 1818 – 5 March 1860 ) was an Austrian composer of opera and instrumental music.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Esslinger was the son of Anton Esslinger, the first Rector of the University of Vienna, a contemporary of Gustav Mahler, Johann Sebastian Bach and Gustav Furtwängler, and his wife, Anna Zwicker. He studied composition with Gustav Mahler, Albrecht Stokowski, Joseph-Gilles Piaget and Karl Gustav Kerkl. During the French Revolution, he was arrested and tortured by the regime for revolutionary activities in Vienna. He lost his right hand, ear, eye, and is estimated to have suffered blindness. He wrote both operas and music for the theatres at the Vienna Palace. He composed the overture to Anton Rubinstein's Don Quixote, for which he won the Grande d'or and was married to the ballet mistress Bernice Schumann. From 1827 to 1831 he worked as a manager at the piano shop at Vienna.  
 During the Parisian Musical Exposition in 1837, he gave an essay in which he gave his view on music and the opera, and expressed a respect for both styles and, according to his mistress, also strongly disliked the Roman Capriccio. His performances at the Exposition were highly admired, and he was offered the recitals of Simon Stevin's The Knight of Tranqueburg in 1839 and Joseph Haydn's La nuit de mouvement in 1841. After Haydn's death, he became one of the principal performers of the Promenade Victoriano when it opened in 1847.In 1840, he published a fine psalm written during his last years, Requiem – an arrangement of the bistro cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1772–1826 ). At his death in 1860, he was the eldest son of Wilhelm Esslinger and Anna Zwicker.  
 In 1845, he and his family fled Austria and settled in Prague where he died in 1860. His children included violinist Alexander Höringer and choirmaster Carl-Marie von Rostrup.

André Brecheil ( 1866–1939 ) was a French mathematician, astronomer and astronomical consultant, formerly of the Sorbonne, who specialized in astronomical field research.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born at Neuilly, he studied mathematics and physics at Paris, where he earned his doctorate.  
 On 20 April 1882, he was sent by Émile Perrin to head the Division for the Analysis of Measurements in the Department of Astronomy and the University Observatory, which was at that time investigating the nature and methods of the trigonometrical method and the formation of an orbital orbit. This made his position in the French Imperial Census Office a combination of teaching ( meteorology ) and research ( his work on comets and comets around Mars ), so that he managed to earn a post of Special Assistant in the Office of the University Observatory for much of the latter period of his life, at the very least until 1903.  
 In 1907, he returned to Paris to prepare maps for the construction of an astronomical observatory. The results of his work on `` Fraunhofer der gegenseitetischen Institut der Universität Leipzig '' were published in 1898 and 1906, but before the completion of the observatory could be completed, the Weizmann Institute of Science transferred him to the Solar Physics Laboratory in New York, where he served until 1922, when he took up the position of University Professor of Elementary and Applied Mathematics. After World War II, he served as Director of the Astrophysical Observatory from 1949 to 1969, a position he maintained until his death.The Jodrell Laboratory built by André Brecheil, known as the `` Planetarium '', contains eight 3-inch quartz stars. Among the instruments on display there is a camera used to record gamma-rays.Brecheil, whose astronomy books include `` Commentaire sur les nomenclature, sur les figures du témoins, sur les arrondissements, et sur les modes, demiennes, de la détermination des énergies '' ( A universal reference for numerical nomenclature, a text about how to pronounce the names of stars, planets, and demi-annular modes, etc., in English ), was known for his generosity. He generously donated about three years of his fortune ( 1950–1954 ) to local schools in an effort to build the Ancona Observatory, which is now a member of the University of California. Also in 1951, Brecheil helped in the construction of a new conference room at the former house of the Société a l'École française de France, located at 718 Lauriston Avenue in Paris.

 = Nikolai Philun =  
Nikolai Nikiforovich Philun ( September 19, 1903 – June 6, 2000 ) was a Russian theoretical physicist. Philun was the first Russian to have taken part in the successful revolution of 1905 and was the creator of the paradoxical vortex of quantum physics.  
 Philun studied mathematics and theoretical physics at the Moscow Institute of Physics, where he graduated in 1930. He became professor in 1941. From 1944 to 1949 he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  
 He was a recipient of the Stalin Prize in 1942.  
 Philun died in 2000.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Philun was the son of a doctor, Alexander Philun. His brother was the Russian cosmologist Boris Philun.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 Philun studied mathematics and theoretical physics at Moscow Institute of Physics, where he graduated in 1930. He became professor in 1941. From 1944 to 1949 he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  
 Philun was a co-founder of the science of quantum mechanics. In 1944, he proposed the possibility of a modern electromagnetic theory in an experiment that involved condensation of magnetic monopoles, and as a result of this, the principle of photoelectric polarization of polarized light was invented. This allows the existence of bipolar polarization.  
 The idea of an electromagnetic photon bombardment enabled to the investigation of polarized light radiation, and subsequently led to the formulation of a theorem in quantum electrodynamics.  
 In 1955, Philun described the concept of Rayleigh scattering in the normal scattering phase of polarized light.  
 He was a recipient of the First Deputy Governor of the USSR State Prize ( 1961 ), with the name of `` Professor of Physics '' ( from 1961, he could receive the title of a Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences ). Philun was a recipient of the Second Deputy Governor's Prize ( 1963 ).

Henry Robert Sechin ( 5 April 1874 – 8 March 1939 ) was an American botanist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Sechin was born in Odessa, Siberia. He earned his B.S. degree at the University of California, Berkeley in 1905, and in 1920 married Jodie Straske, the daughter of a high-ranking Russian military officer, who was later forced to flee to Austria to avoid the Russo-Japanese War. Sechin studied botany at the University of Copenhagen ( from 1910 ), then studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in plant physiology in 1917. Sechin married Mary Sophia Avery in 1918, with whom he had four children ( he later divorced her ). In 1933, he married Teresa Bracco in Sheremetyevo, Russia.After moving to Soho, California, he became the President of the California Academy of Sciences. At Soho he first published An Investigation of the Monocotyledonid Family at the California Academy of Sciences Bulletin ( Bull. 48 ) in 1915, which he published a series of papers and two books. In 1916, he was the lead author of a pioneering report on the flora of Tibet on behalf of the Oriental Society and the American Society for Integrative Biology. He served as the president of the Botanical Society of Washington and another president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. After his death, his wife committed suicide, writing in her journal `` it is easier to argue with you than to explain your idea ''.  
   
   
 == Taxa described by Sechin ==  
 A genus of `` skink '' from eastern South America and northern Africa.  
 A species of tongue-bell spider from Mexico and Central America.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 Sechin married the journalist Jodie Straske on April 5, 1918.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 Much of Sechin's scientific work in the field of plant physiology is attributed to the recognition that his training in the botanical school had come at the expense of his professorly endeavours. Nonetheless, several papers, including that on xanthophytes and arachnids published in 1915 and 1928, were influential in the development of his theory of heterophyllophyllous and non-heterophyllous monocotyledonophytes. Some of his early textbooks, including some on the grouping of species of Lepidophyta ( 1915 ), Histyomorphae ( 1915 ), & Cnidaria ( 1925 ), were incorporated by Kleinschmidt's five-volume Textbook of Botany, which appeared in 1933.

Alexander Christian Beechey, ( 30 May 1769 – 17 May 1859 ) was an English geologist and mineralogist. He is regarded as the first to apply the use of electricity to map. His work, The Mineralogy of Cumberland, compiled between 1811 and 1812, is widely credited as the first geological description of the country's mineral resources.The Johns Hopkins University's Beechey Laboratory offers a free survey of John Hopkins'collection of mineral specimens, 1879.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Beechey was born in Cumberland, Surrey, the son of Thomas Beechey and his wife Susan, and educated at Eton College, London, and in the Royal College of Surgeons School, London, graduating M.A. in 1774.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 His first scientific work was of an important geographical nature. He published a geological map of the whole country and made notes on all the locations on that map. This work, the important portion of which was printed in The Divers'Gazetteer ( 2 vols. 1829–36 ), was of great importance. The mineral geologiques of Cumberland are named after him.  
 In 1824 Beechey undertook an extended exploration into Southern Ireland, and he is mentioned in The Third Review ( April 1830 ).A geological map of Wales, using the Magnetic first aid and numerous detailed observations, was published in 1833 and was the work of over forty years. A book on Northern Ireland was published in 1841.

Serge Dupuy ( 20 August 1856 – 6 January 1924 ) was a French physicist, working in London in the early 20th century. In the 1881 book The Natural Law, Dupuy demonstrated that Maxwell's equations are strictly regular.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was the son of Louis Dupuy and the inventor, James Lancelot Dupuy. His father made sure that the son was educated, as many top scientists and engineers of the day were educated at private schools. Dupuy was educated by his uncle, the noted art teacher Jacques Dupuy. In 1872, he entered the gymnasium of Strasbourg, but only graduated the year before it closed. At the end of that year, he also attended the Paris Conservatoire. After graduating, Dupuy then taught art in his native village of Kattertal, then studied in the Besançon academy from 1878 to 1882, which was converted into the local cantonal university by Joseph Bembo. After three years teaching at Besançon, Dupuy was appointed for experimental physics at Strasbourg University in 1885. At the same time, he worked on the theory of electrodynamics and their application in electricity and magnetism. In 1887, Dupuy started to apply his theory of electrodynamics in lightning rods, and also in microcircuits, which he introduced at the Le-Vieuvent laboratory. In 1896, he was awarded a chair in electrodynamics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

 Porto was born in Lecce, a city which is now in Sicily. Her father, Luigi Porto, was a tailor, her mother and aunt were artisans who had been going to Italy since the times of Shakespeare. In 1858 she got her education in Dortona in part thanks to the friendship of a well-known professor, the Italian architect Alessandro Maraldi. From 1858 to 1866 she studied at the conservatory of Pozzoli in Naples, graduating in 1866. She followed Maraldi's interest in natural history in 1868 and joined the zoological museum in Monte Carlo where she worked with A. G. Giacomo Cossu.  
   
   
 == Porto Porto ==  
 On 11 January 1893, she published Porto Porto - a translation of Portieri's paintings of geological formations in the Mariana Islands, describing a geological and geological time scale for the people who lived there at that time. For decades, Porto Porto ( 1912 ) maintained an important research interest in her native country with the work she was responsible for documenting the spatial relationships between geological formations. In Porto Porto was the first to discuss the purpose of surveys of a marine environment.  
 For her lifelong, she collaborated with Luca Soontari who found once again the necessary understanding of paleogeography through the view of the rings of a dinosaur. For her work, she received many honors : a Presidential prize for color in 1901, the Consular `` Merit of Service '' ( 1908 ), and the Prix Leuven in 1903. She was an honorary member of the Société Geological du Rhine in the Geographical Society of America.

Hugh Lane Walker ( 11 July 1851 – 3 April 1911 ) was a British entomologist, author, and English archaeologist, best known for his descriptions of flowering plants.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
   
 Walker was born in Edinburgh in 1851, the eldest of seven children of John Ayrton Walker, a solicitor, and Emily Hynch Walker. He studied theology at the Free Church of Scotland, and received a BA in 1865, and a PhD in 1869, from the University of Edinburgh. His thesis, on `` An Account of the Environment of the Highlands and of the Orchards of Tyagarra '', has received four separate editions.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1873 he was appointed docent at St Albans, and spent the following year at Reading and a year at Birmingham. In 1879 he moved to Edinburgh to teach at the Free Church, but soon became proficient in English. In 1880 he emigrated to London to teach and research botany. He also studied biology at the University of Edinburgh, and with the assistance of Alexander Campbell was able to obtain an almanack containing description of about five hundred insects.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
   
 The aim of most of Walker's research was to determine when flowering plants had become infertile or sterile, or rather when a small proportion of the flowers became inedible or undesirable to them. In 1884 he was one of the first to publish the first truly comprehensive list of flowering plants, and several further important notes followed, including one on the differential as between the Rhacodes pollen-valves and those of flowering plants which did not contain pollen.  
 In the 1880s he also took up botany as a hobby, first in Solihull and then in Montrose. In 1891 he established the Library of Entomology in Edinburgh. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1906.

Valentin Grillo ( 30 May 1899 in Naples – 28 October 1985 in Rome ) was an Italian geologist and one of the founders of modern geology. He was the first geologist of the Italian pre-industrial era. He is considered by some as the founder of economic geology.In the late 1920s Grillo published a series of monumental contributions on Tertiary and Carboniferous fossils in the Gallicei-Minervina dal Astra Alps. He first published the idea in 1926 but before he started his investigations the walls of the Pantra Canali in Montepulciano had been revealed. Later in 1926 he worked together with Carlo Colombo to analyse the collections in the La Sapienza castle. He continued the work in 1933, preparing the Flora di La Sapienza by scouring the Alps of Southern Italy. In 1936 he undertook the complete assessment of the natural history of the Sciastrina di Etruria in the Carmina ( then known as the Tungiograci ) and published a series of papers on fossils and stratigraphy. He researched the Palaearctic geology, and supported the theory of the origin of the human M-continent in South Asia.

 He was born in Anson, Illinois, and came to Chicago from Vinton County, Iowa. His father was Theodor Atherton, a non-practising Presbyterian minister and theology professor, and his mother, Mary ( or Jeanette ) Houston, was of German-French ancestry. After the death of his mother in 1905, Atherton traveled widely, earning a series of degrees in natural science, zoology, geology, and zoology, but later dropped out of graduate school and received some funds to support his studies. He became a soil chemist in Vinton County, Iowa, and then worked in banking, principally in Van Nuys, California, where he met and married Phoebe C. Brake, a Russian immigrant who became his wife's mother.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1911, Atherton completed his bachelor's degree in geology at the University of Chicago and pursued his doctoral work with George Bowman Ferguson ( 1906–1975 ), a Professor of Geology in Columbia University. His dissertation was entitled `` Spectral Analysis of the Atomic Radius, or atone to physical and chemical destruction '', and he received a PhD on the subject, receiving a doctoral degree in 1913.While working in economics and later as a financial reporter in Washington, D.C., Atherton traveled throughout the United States. He became a lecturer at the University of Chicago, and taught at various colleges and universities, most notably the Graduate School of Business. In 1914, he joined the staff of the U.S. Geological Survey as a senior meteorologist, specializing in meteorology and oceanography, and one of the most esteemed meteorologists of his time.In 1930, Atherton left the U.S. Geological Survey as director of the John Randall Briggs Institute, which is now part of the U.S. Geological Survey in Portland, Oregon, and became Professor of Geology and Dean Emeritus. In 1972, he retired from his position as Professor Emeritus, but continued to serve on the U.S. Geological Survey advisory council.  
   
   
 == Contributions to U.S. Geological Survey ==  
   
 Atherton invented the sulfate ionization method of mineral formation and mineral dehydration, for which he was awarded the 1899 U.S. Geological Survey Aerosol Capture Medal. His method was published in 1916 in Chemical Geology, an American science journal. With Bowman Ferguson ( 1906–1975 ), Atherton also invented the mineral-bearing carbonate glass for separating out the oxides and for which he was awarded the 1932 U.S. Geological Survey Aerosol Capture Medal. In addition to the latter award, he won the 1899 U.S. Geological Survey Aerosol Capture Medal in 1931 and the 1932 U.S. Geological Survey Aerosol Capture Medal for his experiments on acid gases in the atmosphere.  
 In addition, Atherton patented, patented, and patented numerous ideas on metamorphism in the earth that produced numerous copper minerals and minerals inclusions. Atherton theorized that the crust, once molten, should become glass, and the water around the crust should become crystalized through photo-halos and hydrothermal processes. He also discovered magnetite and developed its ferric layer.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 Willard Atherton died in Berkeley, California in 1933. He was survived by his first wife, Phoebe ( who bore his son, Paul, in infancy ). His son, Paul, was a mining engineer and meteorologist for thirty years and retired from academia to become an educationalist. His grandson, Paul J.

 = Marguerite Holm =  
Marguerite Holm ( 1915 – February 16, 2009 ) was an American psychologist and author.  
 She was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was the daughter of Paul R. Holm and Elizabeth K. Hornbostel. She completed a medical degree at Stanford University, received a Ph.D. at Duke University in 1961 and was awarded a Research Associate professorship at Duke in 1968. She worked as a Research Associate from 1964 to 1976 at Duke, serving as a consultant at the Rand Research Institute and the Family Research Council. She was an Invited Speaker at the 1994 American Psychological Association Annual Convention in New York and an Invited Speaker at the Annual Convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972.  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 Marguerite Holm, despite her well known nickname, is best known for her pioneering work on the neurobiology of personality. Holm's research of personality defined multiple groups of personality types, each associated with a corresponding area of the brain.Holm was the first to propose a structure of personality using only one type, H. Holm. Atypical personality is a term she coined to describe people who do not fit into any of the traditionally accepted neurotypical categories. This brain research has allowed researchers to identify areas of the brain important for functioning in multiple types of personality and to ultimately develop better theories on personality.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Holm was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The year of birth is currently unknown. She was the daughter of Paul R. Holm ( 1906–1993 ) and Elizabeth K. Hornbostel. Her father was Professor of Biological Chemistry at Stanford University, and she was a student at Syracuse University ( 1927–1931 ). She completed a medical degree at Stanford University ( 1917 ).  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At Stanford, Holm began a research appointment at Duke University in 1969. During the course of this appointment, Holm would study the neural basis of self-awareness. In this her research was assigned to Dr. Margaret Carlson, who would later become the Director of the Wake Forest University Neuropsychology Clinic. Under Carlson, Holm developed a theory that emphasizes that the ventral cingulate cortex is an important region of the brain involved in self-regulation of both body behavior and the development of body image. Holm would remain with Carlson as a researcher at Duke until her retirement in 1983. In the 1950s Holm was also `` Professor of Personality for the Dunedin Institute for Developmental Neuropsychology in Wellington, New Zealand, `` where she continued to work until her death.  
   
   
 === Health control ===  
 In the 1970s, Holm investigated the relationship between maternal health and the development of adult personality. As part of this, Holm studied the relationship between temperature, maternal exposure to noise and child temperament and personality in rats. Holm and others also investigated the relationship between mood disorders and fetal brain development. In part, Holm's experiments focused on evaluating the influence of prenatal brain development on the prenatal environment. Holm's research study was in mammals, with important work also done in rodents. Holm's findings from the research were published in 1970.  
   
   
 === Behavior ===  
 In her work with music therapy, Holm also explored the behavioral consequences of tone control and time-out in rats. In 1971, Holm, along with James Anderson, reported the first demonstration of an increase in a rat's motivation to play when time-out followed by a tone change resulted in an increase in the rat's performance and playing time.

Samuel Clarke ( 1789 – 1797 ) was a British-Irish cleric, doctor, and scholar. He was born in Norwich on 17 June 1789. He was a disciple of Dr. William James and received his bachelor's degree at King's College, University of London, on 16 November 1783.  
 He served as teacher of medicine and surgery in the Belfast Hospital, and was also appointed to the chair of physiology at Queen's University in Belfast. After graduation, he was called to the bar, but spent most of his career at King's College, London. He was also called to the chair of theological investigations and one of the most eminent divines of the time, a few months before he died. In the past, he received funding from the government and to this end he co-founded the Society for Promoting Universal Knowledge ( Psallicp ( Hb. Zóp ) ). One of his doctrines is that God did not create man, but instead, was the first man on earth. This does not mean that he thought that man was a useless vegetative species. He taught his own children the importance of charity, which was taught by the practice of this philosophy in his philosophy lectures. In 1847 he met Baron Auguste de La Touche ( 1765-1846 ), then mayor of Paris, and came to know him well. In 1778 Clarke was elected to the Royal Society of Arts, but retired from the society when he found that so many of his members were not devout Christians. He was also of a philosophical sensitiveness, an influence on William Howells Tyrie and Rudolf Steiner. He died of kidney cancer at the Kings'Hospital, Belfast, on 18 January 1797. He was buried in Norwich, Essex.

 = Rudolf Kreisler =  
Rudolf Kreisler ( 25 March 1876 – 9 February 1954 ) was an Austrian physicist who made contributions to electrical conductivity, thermodynamics and scattering. He was an early pioneer of X-ray crystallography and the best known crystal-crystallographer at the time. He is often credited as the first crystallographer to observe liquid crystals, but this claim is false, as he was not the first to observe crystal-crystallographic phenomena. The paper describing the phenomenon is now known as Kirchhoff-Kreisler's analysis. He is known for the use of electric discharges. He also invented the Kreisler cell, a coil of electrically conductive wire.  
   
   
 == Education and early career ==  
 Rudolf Kreisler was born in Halle and received an early education in mathematics, physics and mathematics in Lausanne. He worked for a time in the mining industry in Bohemia and then worked as a carpenter in Frankfurt am Main. Kreisler obtained his doctorate in Berlin in 1902 with a thesis on the critical condition of neutron-proton pairs. During his time in the laboratory, he completed a fundamental study of the electric current in the atmosphere, which is at the center of modern X-ray spectroscopy.From 1903 to 1908 Kreisler taught elementary and high school in Hamburg. In 1909 he worked as a demonstrator for a year at the Gewerbeinnenraue Technische Hochschule in Halle. Kreisler was appointed professor of electrical engineering in 1911 and in 1913 became a faculty member at the Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule.  
 In 1913 Kreisler started a German textbook in X-ray crystallography. In 1916 Kreisler founded the Institute for X-Ray Crystallography at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Technical Research in Karlsruhe. He was succeeded in the institute in 1918 by Carl Jacoby, who maintained connections with Kreisler and made Kreisler a director. In 1920 Kreisler was the editor of the journal Optik.With Max Hermann, he developed a large number of X-ray crystallographic experiments. In 1926 he invented the Kreisler cell, which measures the fluorescence of X-ray diffracted light. The colorimetric gel cells were used during an X-ray crystallographic experiment to calculate the number of individual atoms on the surface of gold.In 1927 Kreisler was the first to model the diffusion of liquids through crystals. In 1933, Kreisler discovered that different conduction paths are available for liquids with the same carbon content.In 1935 Kreisler invented an X-ray diffraction microscope which allowed him to study molecules and molecules of different types and proportions. He discovered that X-ray crystals are distinguishable from one another because of a faint shift of emission ( Kreisler-Horn ). Kreisler studied the effect of carbon dioxide on magnetic moments. Kreisler's discovery gave the theoretical basis for carbon dioxide molecular signals. With Howard Silliman, Kreisler became a member of the faculty at the University of Vienna.  
   
   
 == X-ray crystallography ==  
 Kreisler showed that carbon dioxide with similar carbon content, such as that found in the soil, had different magnetic properties than that of the soil.Kreisler applied his results to studying X-ray diffraction microscopy. A large part of Kreisler's work was concerned with optical transitions. He investigated the spectral composition of electrical discharges from passing carriages through lines of conductive wire. He considered how X-ray diffraction resolved a spectrum of few wavelengths of light and about what elements were present in the discharge.  
 He was a founder of the Institute for X-ray Crystallography, which was later merged with the University of Giessen's Department of Chemistry. Kreisler was elected as one of the founders of the Royal Society in 1914. His name was attached to the X-ray microscopy in 1924 by Wilhelm Friedrich von Rath, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Fritz, Gerhard Müller, Rudolf Schermer and August I. Herder.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 Kreisler became concerned with the mass production of high temperature liquid crystals, and moved to Gewerbeinnenraue. He established the Kreisler Alcoolatorium ( the first of its kind in Germany ) in 1919 in Gewerbeinnenraue. He died in Gewerbeinnenraue in 1954. He is buried in Karlsruhe cemetery.

 = Lewis Frank Kirk (usatthespermologist) =  
Lewis Frank Kirk ( September 30, 1922 – February 5, 1996 ) was a 20th-century anthropologist and ethnobotanist.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Kirk was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Virginia's parents, Lester Frank Kirk and Alice Scott Kirk. He studied psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and earned a master's degree there in 1953. He was also active in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, also known as SNCC.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 During World War II, he served in the United States Navy and the US Army Signal Corps, and was a civilian volunteer. While stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, he organized a demonstration against war crimes at the army camp in Overton, Kentucky. The demonstration was orchestrated by Lester Kirk, a wartime pacifist who strongly opposed the Japanese occupation of southern Oregon. He was later mobilized as a prisoner of war by the US Army in the Philippines, where he held a low level of respect for the military leadership there, including President John F. Kennedy, who had always opposed the use of force to fight Japanese insurgents.Kirk began his career at Columbia University as an anthropologist, but had to give up that position in 1951. In the 1950s, he developed and directed the Language and Literacy Project of the University of Southern California. He worked on the Slavic literature of Italy, Russia, Germany, the Caucasus and Turkestan, and published over 300 articles, mostly on Slavic languages. His work included studies of the language spoken in Turkestan, Turkomania, and Sifrgan. One of his most noteworthy works is The Language of the Khazars in Central Asia ( 1961 ), which is often cited as the first European-language study of the Khazars.  
 In 1958, he was offered the appointment of Visiting Professor of Anthropology and Ethnology at the University of Michigan, but he rejected the offer after suffering from an amnesia that led him to isolate himself in a remote valley and contemplate death. He continued to write, and in 1969 published The Art of Turkomania, an unfinished but significant volume on the Turkoman language.  
 In 1967, he was a member of the faculty of Stetson University in Virginia, under the direction of Walter James Campbell. He died in 2006, of cancer at the age of 71.

Margaret Thatcher, M.P. ( 20 June 1908 – 8 October 1992 ) was the third woman to be Prime Minister of Britain. She was born in Cardiff on 20 June 1908, the daughter of John and Dorothy ( Anne ) Thatcher, and educated at the Welsh School of Music, based in Cardiff.The younger of two daughters of economists William I and Margaret Thatcher, she took a keen interest in music and dance and, at the age of 14, joined the choir of the Cathedral Choir in Cardiff. At the age of 21 she became a Pupil at the Welsh Cathedral College. She held this position until her sudden death from cancer on 8 October 1992.  
 Thatcher is famous for her work as a social activist and for her negotiating skills, managing to persuade then Chancellor of the Exchequer Paul Johnson to form a new economic mission organisation for post-war Europe. She was elected to Parliament for the 1968 general election on a commitment to fight the referendum.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 The Tory leader's most famous offspring is the former footballer her father, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Paul Johnson, portrayed in a Shakespearean play titled The Merchant of Venice, by Charles Broderick.However, the birth of her second child, Margaret's husband Christopher Thatcher, played a major role in his support for her post-war career. Christopher, a member of the Labour Party, considered his wife's sexuality to be an affair, and she forced him to take a break from political life and pursue a career in law. By later 1969, they were married and the couple returned to political life. Her second child, their son Christopher, was born in 1972.She enjoyed being in her parents'home in Ellesmere Port, which is situated on a bay on the North Wales coast, near the Moray Firth. She was the daughter of Margaret Thatcher's former brother, The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Peter Murphy. Her father married the Conservative leader Lord Malcolm Thatcher in 1939. She had two daughters, Katherine ( who married Sir Christopher ) and Monica.

 = John Slade (meteorologist) =  
John Slade ( 1662–1741 ) was an English meteorologist. He was a native of Isleworth and studied at Southwell in Wiltshire, where he graduated M.A. in 1723, afterwards being a tutor for Sir John Balfour.  
 He was employed by General Gage's Company as a meteorological laborer from 1728 to 1732. The Company was examining the coal fields in the Northern districts. He found that the better natural conditions to manufacture coal would be reached by farmstead workers, while there was no cultivation on the sugar plantations of the Marshalls or other northern districts. Further, he gave evidence of the necessity for a railway from Middlesex and the Downs to London and Southampton, and pointed out the difficulties of building the new Ironwork and the difficulty of retaining the production of wool. He was also a leading observer in seeing the meteorological effects of increasing rainfall.

Wilhelm Karl Lemhagen ( ; July 20, 1914 – February 4, 1977 ) was a German politician and member of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ).  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wilhelm Lemhagen was born in Münster, but spent the first sixteen years of his life in Dusseldorf. In 1936, he graduated from the University of Stuttgart and started a law practice. In 1938 he married Valentina Liebmann, a doctor, in Salzburg, and they had five daughters. A year later they moved to Düsseldorf, to Leipzig, where Lemhagen also acted as a partner of Hervor in a law firm. In 1939 Lemhagen entered the Nazi Party.  
 From 1943 to 1945, Lemhagen was on the economic advisory board for the Third Reich Landtag. He soon became the minister for the Interior of the West German state of Saxony. He resigned from his post in 1946 when the armistice was signed. He served as chancellor of Saxony from 1946 to 1948.In 1950 Lemhagen joined the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) as a member of the new Christian Democratic Party ( CDU/CSU ), and was appointed deputy minister for transport and industrial development. He served in that post until 1957. In 1959, the CDU reorganized and became the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU/CSU ). From 1961 to 1964, he was acting chancellor of Saxony. In 1966, Lemhagen was named senator of Saxony. In 1972 he became the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ).In August 1964, he held the roles of chairman of the general assemblies of the CDU ( Dusseldorf and Rhineland-Palatinate ) and the Christian Democratic Union ( Dusseldorf ).From January 1971 to February 1974, he was the chairperson of the European Monitoring Centre. On February 15, he had a break with his colleagues at the head office in Dusseldorf after a television controversy during a live broadcast of the shows Langer und Neubauer. On that same day, he and his wife were kidnapped by local Communist Party members. He was held at Düsseldorf Düsseldorf Airport until February 15, 1974, where he spent two months in custody. He later confessed that his wife was only carrying a letter saying that she wanted to go to Bergen to visit her sister. On April 5, 1976, a court found him guilty of abducting the parents and abducting his wife. He was sentenced to one year in prison, but was released on September 26, 1976. His sentence was commuted to probation, serving two years of unpaid leave and then being given amnesty. He was released from prison on August 26, 1978, and promptly returned to office in November 1979.Lemhagen died in a car accident on February 4, 1977, at the age of 62.

 = Akhmet Bulut =  
Akhmet Bulut ( 3 May 1909 – 27 March 1997 ) was a Turkish economist and economist. He was the grandson of Akhmet Bulut.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Akhmet Bulut's hometown in the far northwest of Turkey, Akhmet Bulut studied economics, law, philosophy and history at a university in Istanbul. He obtained his PhD in 1933. In 1936 he joined the Turkish Faculty of Political Science.  
 In 1941 he emigrated to the United States. From 1950 to 1955 he worked as a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, the university's main research center.  
 In 1963 he left Vanderbilt and became Director of the Center for Economic and International Studies at the University of Oxford, where he worked with Neville A. Chamberlain. In 1970 he became a visiting professor at the same university, then in 1971–1975 he was professor emeritus. At Oxford, he was known as the patron of the discipline of economic geography.  
 In the early 1970s, he started working as a fellow at the Center for International Studies of the New School for Social Research, which he would depart from in 1979. Bulut was honored with honorary doctorates from the Johns Hopkins University, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Michigan, and the University of Edinburgh, and in 1988 the University of Toronto awarded him the McLellan Prize in Economics and Economics of Human Values.  
 Bulut's influence on globalization also extends beyond his own home country. In the 1980s, he played a role in the formation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. As a result of his work at the World Bank, the Institute for International Economic Studies ( IES ) was born. The IES developed a program in economics called `` The World Economy '' that advanced the work of Abdullah Iraklyan of the International Institute for Social Studies ( ISS ), which before him was primarily focused on German and Soviet studies. IES financed Bulut's translation of Friedrich von Hayek's Social Statics into Turkish in 1987 and another called Welfare Economics in 1990.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Bulut saw the wage distribution system of classical monetarist economics, and modern Keynesian economics, as a model for what should replace that system. He argued that every advanced country should follow the world's current currency scheme, in order to achieve its financial objectives. Like Keynes, he saw the market as an interdependent and mutually reinforcing process between government and non-government actors.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 While serving as Director of the Center for Economic and International Studies at the University of Oxford from 1969 to 1973, Bulut was one of the few prominent economists from the middle and far-right to explore in depth a range of controversial issues in the political world of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The party he helped found, the Liberaltarian Party, has a close relationship with Turkey's Radical Party, who have their own highly unorthodox view of modern economics. He was even one of the six Turkish figures who received honors by former Prime Minister of Turkey, Abdullah Gul, for his contributions to Turkish public discourse. Bulut is also remembered for founding the moderate scholar think tank Semiatik on behalf of the Turkish academic community in 1971.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Bulut married Laura Greiss in 1937 and they had two sons, Alexander Huzi Bulut ( later Gülen ) and Fereydin Şıkılmaz. In 1980 Bulut married Emma Munsen, a fellow Australian anthropologist who studied with him at Oxford.

 = Samuel Charles Curie =  
Samuel Charles Curie ( July 18, 1877 – November 27, 1948 ) was a Belgian-American theoretical physicist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in the city of Bucharest, Curie was educated in Rome and Göttingen, where he graduated with a PhD in geodesy. He taught at Tufts University from 1908-1909. In 1908 he married Catherine Phunau ( 1919-2005 ), a Belgian-American scientist, and they moved to the United States in 1911. He taught at the University of Maryland, where he received his doctorate in physics in 1922. He served in the U.S. Navy, and returned to research. He moved to the University of Florida, where he served as the Chair of Physics in 1946.  
 After Curie's retirement from his professorship, he was an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Florida, but he remained in UF's research laboratories. In 1964, he became the first Director of the Division of Physics at the National Science Foundation, the precursor to the National Science Foundation in the United States.  
 In 1950, Curie won the Nobel Prize in Physics, the second for the invention of X-ray diffraction.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Curie was the first to describe the `` Curie angles '' of liquid helium, and the first to point out that some substances exhibit `` behavior '' beyond that of ordinary molecules and gases.  
 He named the radioactive isotope helium-4, first discovered in 1897 by Nikolai Rubinstein.  
 Curie was a founding member of the Laboratory for Theoretical Physics ( LTP ) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The LTP was an interdisciplinary group that investigated strange and unexpected behavior in natural matter. He coined the term `` heat '' to refer to the heat of motion, and predicted that two pieces of rock above and below the Earth's surface would interact with each other to produce heat, while applying further investigations of the conditions under which this interaction was possible. He was also the first to perform theoretical work that exploited magnetic fields.

Konstantin Leonidovich Laksov ( Russian : Никола́ндр Сорович Иванов ; 7 July [ O.S. 13 September ] 1905 – 29 September 1990 ) was a Soviet physicist and a leading authority on particle physics.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Leonid Aleksandrovich Laksov was born in the village of Novogrodcheniye ( now Tomsk ) in the Kherson Governorate, a Tatar Autonomous Okrug region. He was interested in science since childhood. From 1908 he studied in the Leningrad State University, graduating with an an M.Sc. degree in 1926.  
 In 1926, he obtained his Ph.D. at the Moscow State University under the supervision of Isaac Khachaturian. In 1927 he was appointed Professor of the Department of Physics at the University of Leningrad, where he remained until 1939, when he was named to the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was a leading figure in the research of Collisions, or Inertial and Electrodynamic Physics, and an important influence in the Soviet nuclear-revolution. His numerous scientific publications ( Ph.D. and M.Sc. ) included theoretical work on the theory of the kinematic and exciton scattering in liquids ( his name appears in synonyms for Max Born and Vincenzo Vaidra ), the physics of energy transfer in gases, and the mechanics of the relativistic macroscopic interactions between a charged particle and an extended particle. In 1947 he returned to Leningrad. In 1966, he was appointed head of the Physics Department of the University of Moscow. His most important works are listed in the research guide on colliders and velocities published by Laksov in 1984.Although Laksov was elected a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1949, his time in that post was not recognised in the official Soviet science history, which did not mention him. He was eventually appointed to a chair at the University of Leningrad, but this was only for an academic year. In the early 1950s, he published several papers on time dilation, a theorem in which he showed that the equivalent of the free-falling speed of light is equal to the approximate speed of sound, a finding which, he felt, would improve the problem of the theories of inertial and electrodynamic fields. Laksov in the 1960s issued several novels and plays, and a film in 1969, Mileva Podlaskova, with a fictional Soviet nuclear reactor physics program.In 1977, the United States'Atomic Energy Commission awarded Laksov the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the 1970s he expressed a desire to work with a Soviet particle accelerator and made several proposals for their development.  
   
   
 == In popular culture ==  
 Laksov is depicted in the 1942 film River of the Dead ( in Russian ).  
 The A.I.G. production company made a television production of the documentary Laksov's Legacy.

Eugenia William Evans ( 28 June 1888 – 21 February 1954 ) was an American conservationist, plant scientist, and writer on biology and politics.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Evans was born in Spring City, Michigan, the only child of George Evans, a sign language interpreter, and his wife, Cornelia. She was the daughter of Josiah Edgar Evans, a fur trader and business partner in Chicago. George died of peritonitis while Eva was young, and she nursed him and raised her until she turned 17. She attended high school in Lake Superior, where she developed a strong interest in nature. She graduated from the University of Michigan in 1912, enrolled in the University of Chicago, and in 1915 married Professor C. S. Tarver. The couple eventually moved to Denver, where she became a member of the University of Denver Department of Botany.  
 Evans began her research of plants in 1921, with the help of George Evans. Among her many published papers was On the Fruits and Leaf of the Asclepiadaceae and Candelaria under the supervision of Carleton L. Zow. Evans was the first woman to be awarded a D.Sc. in botany by the University of Michigan.Evans took many walks throughout the University of Denver's urban neighborhoods, especially the College Avenue Village. She later wrote in her memoirs, `` I made my best of the time on walk by walk. I made my acquaintance with all living things that walked on Earth. `` The study of flowers found Evans at the forefront of the field of plant taxonomy and research.

 = Nicholas Bourdon =  
Nicholas Ewan Cowan Bourdon ( 9 July 1922 – 13 October 2007 ) was a British psychologist who worked in group and personality processes. He developed the concept of conflict-friction in children and later defined four structural functions associated with conflict for which the Bulletin of the Edinburgh Psychoanalytic Society holds a full-member membership. In addition to his publications, he wrote over 80 journal articles and gave talks about his research.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born Nicholas Ewan Cowan in Penzance, New Zealand, in 1922, the only child of schoolteacher Gwilym Cowan and his wife Jane, née Warren. He was educated at Penzance Grammar School. He studied psychology at the University of New York, graduating with a B.A. in 1937. He was awarded a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Glasgow in 1941.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1948, at the age of 22, he was appointed to the position of Léon and Catherine West-Barnett Professor of Psychology at the University of London. He had been appointed by Ethel Evelyn Welford, the Minister of Education. In 1948, following a rise in his workload and an increase in problems, he moved to the University of Edinburgh and began teaching in the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) Psychology Department. The Department was new to the UK, and he was called upon to provide additional services to help train students. He left the RCP in 1954 and moved to the University of Glasgow to begin the Ph.D. program in psychology there.In 1956, Bourdon married Elizabeth ( b. 1947 ). Together they had a son, Peter ( born 1949 ). Elizabeth and Nicholas began working at the university as developmental psychotherapists. He became the Director of RCP Psychiatry in 1971 and worked at the Epworth Psychiatric Hospital until 1973. In 1984, Bourdon moved to the University of London to take up the position of Professor of the Faculty of Psychology.  
 In 1987, he joined the Psychology Research Unit at the University of Manchester in an area that his interest had been growing for decades. The Department of Psychology became one of the most innovative academic research institutions of the world, with scientists such as Frank Alpert, Stephen M. Bellisle, Alberto de Pastano, and others creating important new research on the foundations of human psychology, neuroanatomy, and physiology. In 1998, he established the School of Psychological Science, where the research in the Centre of Personality, Decision and Decision Making ( CSDPM ) continues to be conducted.Nicholas Bourdon was awarded the honour `` John Alan Bourdon '' in 1989 for a paper in Clinical Psychiatry that described such a strong relationship between failure to learn and misperception. His 1969 autobiography, Pansy, Philip and the World of Love and Friendship, remains an important textbook for this topic, as is his 10th book, Happy Moods : The Psychology of Interpersonal Life, which teaches `` activities that lead to fulfillment in a warm and secure environment ''.

 = Georges-Alexandre Victor Ion =  
Georges-Alexandre Victor Ion ( 22 January 1823 in St Gallen, France – 28 December 1901 in Geneva, Switzerland ) was a Swiss mineralogist and physicist. He made important contributions to mineralogy and the theory of graphites, in particular when he demonstrated the existence of amorphous amorphous crystals in graphite. This was preceded by decades of work in crystallography. He was also the father of structural geologists.Ion developed what he called `` ley lines '' in graphite. In 1892 he suggested that the grains have been arranged in odd numbered sets. The idea of rearranging the ordered numbers allowed him to perform mathematical equations related to their locations on a crystal surface. Ion was director of the laboratory of crystal identification from 1891 until his retirement in 1908. He was president of the Institute of Mineralogy in the Swiss canton of Hesse from 1899 to 1902. He was the corresponding editor of the Journal of Petrography from 1877 to 1895 and was the editor of the Journal of the American Society of Mineralogists from 1887 to 1898.

 = Nathan Aldert Heinrich Ferdinand von Hopp =  
Nathan Ferdinand von Hopp ( 1578–1632 ) was a German orientalist and philologist.  
 Hopp was born on 30 December 1578, in Frankfurt, the son of a merchant. In 1582, he attended the university of Würzburg, studied law in Rome, obtaining his habilitation in 1603 and afterwards became a private secretary and notary in Stuttgart.  
 A few years later, he wrote his more important book on Middle Eastern history, Book iuris de polonie Italianorum, or Arabic Pilgrims and Jews of Italy. The second volume, La Sénégal des Pacifiens, a translation of the Latin of Saint Teresa and known to be the first scientific text on the history of the United States, was translated into Latin in 1611 by Pope Pius IX, and was a widely read work. Hopp was also the first to investigate the political conditions in Cyprus. He was highly respected for his research, publishing the third and fourth volumes of Book iuris. The manuscript manuscript of the third volume is housed in the Bavarian State Library of the University of Halle.  
 After the fall of the Principality of Venice in 1619, Hopp resumed his position as private secretary, and wrote his well-received History of the Pilgrims and Jews of Sicily ( 1616 ), the major work on the island. In it he coined the modern term `` Mussulman '', a term that has given rise to rivalry between Italian-American and American-Jewish historians.The Royal Danish Alumni Hall of Science at Athens, under Hopp's leadership, is named in his honor.  
 In the same year, Hopp discovered the journal Entscheidung und Beschreibung des Weltanschauungsbeschreibunges, which proved seminal in the development of Indo-European history. In 1606, Hopp published Die eigener Krankheit des Mittenz ( A Portrait of an Indian ), a work of literary criticism that took on an intensity and character characteristic of his later writings. From the second edition he published a translation of the Greek Epistle to the Romans, translated by his brother Paul Argetius, originally in Latin and now in German. The translation was not written from scratch, but was intended as a commentary on the epistle. Like Argetius, Hopp ’ s German friend Johannes Heysen also published a translation of this work. In 1610 Hopp also published his works, in German, which were mostly devoted to Oriental and philological topics.  
 Hopp wrote his last work in 1628, the History of the Bible in 4 volumes : Du étude nouvelle, et des mouvements de nature ( 4 volumes, 4 volumes, 4 volumes ).

 = Bruno Degeirw C3 A1n =  
Bruno Degeirwàn ( German : [ ɡɡu-fɔn ] ; 19 July 1864 – 24 January 1962 ) was a German-born American neurologist and psychiatrist. He was one of the leading neurologists of his generation. He was a notable exponent of the electrophysiological and electroencephalogram approach.  
 Degeirwàn was born in Fieglitz near Schücken. As an undergraduate, he earned a doctorate at Göttingen, and then a master's degree in 1881 and 1882 at the University of Berlin, where he attained an MA in 1889. In 1896, he took a job in the neurology department at the St. Louis Hospital, where he remained until 1908. After leaving the St. Louis Hospital in 1908, he became a demonstrator in psychoacoustics and later a professor in neurological neurology and neurosurgery at the University of Berlin.  
 Degeirwàn's work covered brain structure, distribution, structure of ganglia, and function. He served as director of the Berlin Pharmacopoeia from 1905 to 1907, and served as vice-president of the St. Louis Hospital from 1910 to 1914. He was president of the American Psychological Association from 1914 to 1916, and from 1922 to 1924 he was its president. He served as director of the New York City Hospital from 1929 to 1932, and was appointed to the chair of the psychiatry department at the Medical College of Columbia University in 1934. In 1936 he was awarded the Albert Einstein Memorial Prize in Neurophysiology.  
 After returning to Berlin in 1938, Degeirwàn returned to the United States, taking over as director of the neuropsychiatric hospital department at the Imperial College Hospital, where he retired in 1945. He died at home in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 87. His son, Boerhilde Degeirwàn, is also an influential neurologist.Degeirwàn conducted pioneering research into nervous conduction. One of his studies was investigating the relation between depression and the thoracic spine and spinal cord. He hypothesized that depression affects the phalangeal process of the spinal cord through corticosteroid action, leading to a disruption in the pattern of electrical activity in the spinal cord. This type of disruption is an indicator of the subglial origin of depression, and therefore that depression is associated with sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. He concluded that, because depression increases the risk of spinal-cord injury, it should be regarded as a form of `` glucocorticoid-induced arthritic disease ''. He was known for his studies of specific neurotransmitters, and he proposed that neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. He concluded that these neurotransmitters are necessary for normal brain function, and research related to his work has been cited by more than two hundred researchers and neurologists. His research led him to explain and put into practice a model of spinocerebellar dysfunction that has been described by other investigators. He also summarized the results of studies involving stroke, back pain, migraine, convulsions, and back problems, and he discussed the historical origins of the mental disorder of phlebitis. His late essays have been translated into many languages, including Persian, Italian, German, Italian and Dutch.  
 He was one of the first to observe that the first stages of life have a complex relationship to the development of brains. Early stages of brain development were stable or stable, but in later stages, stages 2 and 3 of brain development show a more or less irregular pattern. He summarized these early stages of brain development and identified major phases of the brain during childhood : auditory ( affect ), visual ( action ), motor ( vision ), and sensory ( memory ) stages.Degeirwàn served as editor of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences from 1928 until 1948, and the American Journal of Psychiatry from 1935 until 1950.Degeirwàn earned the Franklin Institute of the Advancement of Medical Science Medal in 1935.

 = William Henry Wilson =  
William Henry Wilson, ( 15 August 1849 – 26 June 1943 ) was a British biologist and botanist, known for his research of New Zealand flora and mushrooms.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wilson was born in Firthans, Suffolk in 1849, but only the second child of Dr William George Wilson ( 1788–1844 ), the Governor-General of New South Wales, and Emily Madeline Wilson ( née Wilson, 1819–1894 ). His father was the son of George Warner Wilson ( d. 1836 ), a miller, who succeeded his father as Governor of New South Wales. From his early youth, William was an avid reader and a great scholar and his tutor at Scarborough School was eminent author William James. He had some experience as a teacher, and was capable of teaching himself algebra, Latin and foreign languages.  
 As an undergraduate student, Wilson became a regular visitor to Edinburgh, gaining a reputation in Edinburgh as `` a master of the country of Scotland ''.  
 After graduating in 1881, Wilson went on a course in physics at Trinity College, Dublin. There he was admitted to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, being elected to the fellowship in 1884.During his research of the New Zealand flora he visited Wilmot and Canterbury, and studied the plants of the Selwyn, Marlborough, Muir, and Chatham districts. He worked at Coal Harbour and elsewhere during the first two years of his stay in England. His observations were published in his Transactions of the Natural History Society of London. Wilson was chairman of the botany section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and was elected a Fellow in the year 1889.From 1898 to 1900 he was a member of the Royal Irish Academy.  
 Wilson died on 26 June 1943, in Dublin, Ireland.

 = Constantin Ponius =  
Constantin Ponius ( 2 October 1805 – 21 March 1862 ) was a Polish-born German anatomist born at Frutmänster, near Liege, Belgium.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He began his career as a court surgeon, but shortly after became a follower of the naturalist Josiah Warren. Ponius subsequently studied anatomy at the University of Leipzig.  
 In 1836, he began teaching anatomy to young children at the Jagiellonian University of Vienna. In the following years, he conducted additional research in tectonics, cartography, zoology, hydraulics, and animal husbandry. In 1852 he moved to the United States where he continued his work on the mechanical advantage of homeopathic remedies. In 1856, he was elected to the International Academy of Medical Sciences. He was also the father of Paul Ponius, an anatomist.  
   
   
 == Important achievements ==  
 In 1841, he demonstrated that the spiracular volume of the skull contains 60 % of the total volume of the nasal cavity and 40 % of the volume of the subnasal cavity, confirming earlier speculation on craniofacial development by Steven Gairdner. In 1844, he determined that the upper, apical, and distal nasal nerves belong to the lateral and posterior cranial nerves of the skull.From 1857, Ponius characterized the blood supply in the nasal cavity. This was widely used to explain the sensation of nasal congestion that is common with chronic nasal diseases.  
 Ponius made a significant contribution to the science of embryology, known today as hemodynamics. He made extensive, cross-sectional studies of the development of mammalian ovum, shown by Paul Noël.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 He was married to Jessie Emelie Mcclure Ponius, née Stuttgart.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 The first named child of Constantin Ponius and Jessie Emelie Mcclure Ponius was Daniel Ponius ( 1831–1854 ), a son born in 1835 to Josephine, an apprentice at Dr. Ponius's laboratory, and Rev. Daniel Sturgis Mcclure Ponius ( 1836–1897 ), son of Rev. Simon Sturgis Mcclure Ponius ( 1782–1848 ). He was also related to the author and farmer Edward Sturgis Mcclure, an early-American pioneer in medicine and fur trader.

Charles Perrin Miller ( November 4, 1852 – March 3, 1938 ) was an American linguist, known for his contributions to Japanese literature, and for his studies of Japanese and Chinese, being an ex-graduate student of Sohno Zenobu in the University of Chicago. He was one of the most prominent advocates of the Cushman–Merrill theory of phonetic sounds.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Miller was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on November 4, 1852. His father, William Campbell Miller, was an elder statesman who had been Professor of government at Vanderbilt University and later the Director of the American Tax Commission. He was a surgeon in the Confederate army. The family moved to Miami in 1862, and later to Portsmouth, Massachusetts. Miller's first son was born on October 28, 1864.In the following years, Miller spent most of his time at Suffolk University ( he graduated in 1866, and remained there until 1879 ), where he helped found the Department of Foreign Language, American National Institute, and later the International Institute for Japanese Studies.  
 In March 1871, Miller began graduate work at the University of Chicago with the view of producing a dissertation based on the comparative phonological research of the nineteenth century. But at the start of his dissertation, Miller was caught up in an expedition through Korea conducted by the Sanitary Commissioner's Bureau of Sanitation and Excise ( which involved the shipment of many millions of colored kimono-clad women of all age groups ) to Japan. Miller returned to the United States and secured his doctorate in 1872 under the direction of Ethel M. Turkington.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Miller was appointed Associate Professor in 1874 at the University of Chicago, and was awarded the Albert C. Burroughs Medal in 1882, the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Sheldon Award in 1886, and the Cushman-Merrill Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1889. He remained at the University of Chicago until 1890, when he accepted a professorship in the Department of Chinese at Yale University, where he remained until his death.  
 He became an academician in 1886, and became professor in 1891. He was a fellow of the Society for Scientific American ( 1901 ) and president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1919.  
   
 Miller is known for his many research papers, and also his unique study of traditional Chinese poetry and music, which was performed for the first time by Ethel M. Turkington in a historic public performance at the Yale University Hall in 1910.  
 Miller graduated from Yale University in 1884, and did his master's degree work under Sohno Zenobu.  
 In 1885, Miller returned to Cincinnati to become an editor of the Journal of European Literature, and he continued writing until his death in 1938.His sons are Edward E. Miller ( Ph.D. ), Sohno Miller ( Ph.D. ), and Elizabeth S. Miller ( D.D. ), and they reside in Cincinnati.

 = Christoph B. Neumann =  
Christoph Wilhelm Neumann ( 23 September 1877 – 10 May 1965 ) was a German-born scientist and sociologist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Christoph Wilhelm Neumann was born in Stuttgart on 23 September 1877 and emigrated to the United States in 1912. He was a music professor in Stuttgart and became active in the social sciences in the US. He taught for 30 years at Brown University. In 1919 he completed a doctorate at Johns Hopkins University.  
 He became professor of Economics at the University of Chicago from 1931-1948, and from 1948 until his retirement in 1975 became dean of the Graduate School of Public Administration.  
 In his first book ( 1946 ) he defended the contributions of labor theory in the theory of population sociology, later reopening this idea with his most influential book, The Economic Origins of Population ( 1947 ). This began the current trend in demographic and social sociology that economists claim is a response to the `` energy crisis '' of World War II, a conflict in which technological modernization led to increased demand for the working class and an increase in the status of women and of racial minorities.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Neumann examined the role of the concentration of wages in industrial production, to determine how unemployment affected consumption.  
 Neumann believed that the effects of technology could be exploited by the employing classes, and published studies that he hoped would be used as a lesson in urban sociology. In a 1941 article he wrote about the economic education of low-income children, he predicted that such courses would help lower-class children to develop an understanding of the values and values of competition. He did however draw a comparison with Marxism, in that it taught children to think critically. For example, Neumann predicted that Marx's criticism of the contradiction between proletariat's economic interest in the production of surplus value and capitalist exploitation of labour would contribute to the emergence of a concept of `` laddism '' in the worker's class consciousness that would inform future counter-revolutionary thinking.  
   
 Neumann's focus on wages was influential during the post-war `` Third Industrial Revolution '' in which wages were a major political issue. Following a revolution in 1947 for which Neumann was best known, wages took a back seat for working-class resistance to cuts in state services. Wages in Germany and in other developed capitalist countries have since been on a steady upward trajectory. When it came to matters of wages, by the 1950s the human demand theory that Neumann developed, similar to Walter Reed's, had been widely applied in the development of neo-liberalism. Neumann warned that the `` pace of technological advance has outstripped Marx's vision of a dialectical progression of technology that eventually transcends capitalism and arrives at socialism ''. During this period, Neumann also began developing the notion of labor supply and demanded that society institute policies that would increase it, proposing the concept of `` socialized labor '' in a 1948 article.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Neumann married his wife, Anna, in 1924. They had five children, one of whom became a statistician. He was also a pianist, violinist and harpsichordist.

 = Charles Lambert Roger =  
Charles Lambert Roger ( 23 April 1875 – 25 November 1955 ) was a British scientist, known as one of the first English physicists to measure electromagnetic radiation.  
 He discovered what is known as the Hertz resonance, a resonance constant related to the electromagnetic radiation inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave. In this equation is created the Lambert's ratio, which measures the proportion of a given value of electromagnetic radiation inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.  
 Roger was born in London, the son of Robert Roger of New Kensington. Roger was educated at Eton College and Harrow School, studying electrical engineering under Max Norden. During World War I he served as a Lieutenant, afterwards graduating from St John's College, Cambridge.  
 The following year he joined Imperial College London as a lecturer in physics, where he remained until the war. In 1922, he became the first Professor of Physics at Imperial. He gave numerous lectures on optics and in 1929 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. During this period he had also made large contributions to radio astronomy, and he had also investigated the gravitational influence of cosmic rays. He died on 25 November 1955.

 = John Ray Hubbard (geologist) =  
John Ray Hubbard ( 7 June 1907 – 23 July 1982 ) was an Australian-born geologist and prominent proponent of the notion that Australia was most likely the cradle of civilisation.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 John Ray Hubbard was born on 7 June 1907 in Sandringham, Queensland. He had two brothers, Gerald and George, who all went on to achieve leading positions in industry and science. He studied geology at Melbourne University ( 1921-24 ) and received his BSc ( 1925 ) and MSc ( 1925 ) from Sydney University. He was awarded a visiting professorship from the University of California, Berkeley ( 1928 ) and was a student of Sir Alfred North Whitehead, an authority on the human genealogy. In 1930 he was awarded the Mosman Medal, the highest honour of Australian university academics.He retired from the University of Sydney in 1968. He taught at Griffith University, a government school, from 1971 to 1972. He also was the Australian Secretary of the World Academy of Sciences from 1969 to 1972.  
   
   
 == Influence ==  
 As a scientific advocate of the Aboriginal '' past, Hubbard shared the beliefs of anthropologist Edward Tolmie that Aboriginal cultures were settled by a stream of migrants from ancient lands who originally became citizens of Australia and migrated as inland settlers. He was also an early proponent of the idea that the Boer Wars with the British that nearly split the country was over land issues.  
 In a number of his books, Hubbard describes various myths and legends that influenced his thinking. In The Secret Life of an Aborigine he describes Aboriginal `` ceremonial ecstasy '' as a means of manipulating their humanity, defining an enemy as either an enemy of the tribe or their creator. In the same book, he claims that the Aborigine's Aboriginal name is Maat. Hubbard considered it a repugnant word that would vilify and dehumanise the aborigines and led him to retract the epithet. In the final chapters of his book, Hubbard lists some of the reasons for rejecting the ethnic origins of Aborigines, saying they are 'not good people. '' This is not the first time Hubbard had used the word '' butcher '', but his use of it makes it the most common the word has been used in Australian public speech.  
 Hubbard's use of the word also triggered a backlash, and his use of it led to public protests.  
 In his autobiography, Hubbard is said to have denied that he was a Jew. Hubbard's daughter Kristine also denied that Hubbard was a member of any illegal party or organisation.

 = Michael A. Frank =  
Michael A. Frank ( 1876–1941 ) was an American physiologist and physiologist. He was a pioneer of muscle histology, the analysis of muscle fibers and fibers fibers per muscle unit and fibroblast growth factor, demonstrating that growth factors mediate key biochemical processes in muscle contraction.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Michael A. Frank was born in March 1876 to Thomas C. Frank and Rosina Frank in Kingsport, Indiana, the son of John C. and Rosalinde ( Frank ) Frank. After graduating from the College of DuPage in 1916, Frank was the only graduate from DuPage to earn a doctorate in physiology. In 1916, he graduated from the University of Chicago, and then in 1918 he received an honorary doctoral degree from Columbia University, where he had stayed since 1921.  
 From 1920 to 1935, he was a lecturer in physiology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York. The Linus Pauling Institute at Columbia University held him in high esteem, and during his career he made many discoveries related to basic cell biology and nuclear biochemistry, at the Linus Pauling Institute, and at various research centers, such as the National Institute of Inorganic Biochemistry.  
 In 1930, Frank left the medical profession for a life of full-time research. From 1935 to 1959, he was professor of physiology at the University of Chicago. From 1959 to 1975, he was chairman of the Department of Physiology, Division of Comparative Physiology at the University of Chicago. At the time of his death, he was co-author of the book Creatine Kinase, a review of research related to this enzyme in general and muscle contraction in particular.Frank was known for his sophisticated and patient-centered training programs for science-trained physicians in science and art and to young graduate students and undergraduates studying biomedical science, who assisted his approach to training them by providing them with sound reading of textbooks, a demonstration of using liquid crystals as a model of muscle, and course materials and videos in their academic programs.

 = John Irwin Sinclair =  
John Irwin Sinclair ( 13 September 1842 – 9 February 1915 ) was a Scottish botanist.  
 Sinclair was born in Redruth. In 1888 he started work at the now defunct Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where he developed a particular interest in the mosses he found growing in the grounds. He later lived at Westfield House, where he built up an extensive collection of mosses, most of which was grown on the estate. In the 1840s he was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1851 was appointed curator of the plant section at Kew. In 1857 he moved to Newnham Abbey, London, where he set up a prolific garden and, in 1870, established the botanical and floral museum at his abbey. Sinclair's collection was given to the Kew Society.  
 He was the first person in Scotland to collect British species of fungi. Many of his work was characterized by close research and meticulous labelling, but his main work took him to the South-Western regions of England, France, Spain, and Norway, where he established and established a relationship with botanists such as James Chadwick, Ralph Rivers, Alexander Arnold and Lord Rayleigh. His collections can still be found at Kew Gardens in the form of tablets and microscopes.

 = Christoph Erziehung =  
Christoph Georg Erziehung ( 4 August 1832 – 5 August 1915 ) was a German mining engineer, physicist and a natural scientist. His father, Friedrich Christoph Erziehung ( b. 25 January 1844 ), was a composer of operas, and mother was Anna Raalda in 1832.  
 He studied engineering under Wilhelm von Liebig at the University of Tübingen, where he made important discoveries in solid-state physics, especially in photographic calorimetry, and on the speed of electricity.  
 In the winter of 1864–65 he was inspector of mining engineering at Metz, and as an assistant in the Metallurgical Institute ( Siemens ) at Braunschweig. In 1871–72 he was elected a member of the German Academy of Sciences and Letters, and in 1877–78 a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  
 In 1879 Erziehung and Heinrich Locher-Wolff ( 1809–1887 ) were among the first in Europe to see the possibility of a method for extracting platinum from meteorites. This lead to discoveries in the mineralogy of rare elements, and new studies on the possibility of producing platinum from fissile uranium ( of which Germany is in a crisis ) and thorium ( of which no more than two countries have produced a period of history of this production ).  
 In 1887 he was elected the director of the Central Institute for Metallurgical Research in the city of Braunschweig, which had been established at that time to oversee this research. The institute, which still exists today, is among the leading research centers of the world.  
 Erziehung died in Braunschweig on 5 August 1915.

 = Adolf Korelitzky =  
Adolf Korelitzky ( Russian : Бард Барович Мирликов, born Nov. 21, 1882 in Artemivsk, German : [ koleːlɛlθʲɪvʲɪs ] ; June 11, 1919 – April 3, 1966 ) was a Soviet–Soviet physicist who worked on nuclear physics.  
 He studied physics and became a full professor in 1917.  
 Korelitzky was a strong supporter of the theory of relativity, studying its principles of governing the behaviour of particles and of regularities in elasticity. In 1903, he was the first to prove the Lorentz transformation ( then known as the Lorentz transform ) for one of the fundamental particles, atomic hydrogen. Two years later, he showed that the same Transformation would not hold for all elementary particles, with a special `` incorrect '' case where one of the three observers were correct.  
 In 1905, he developed a theory based on the Lorentz transformation that could explain the structure of protons. Theory was proven by August Schrödinger in 1924 and was later popularized by Robert A. Millikan in the book Quantum mechanics. The result has been called the `` most significant discovery '' in the history of physics.In the laboratory of his father in Moscow, he developed the three-body problem and the Klein–Dahle problem, as well as the thin sheet paradox. In his subsequent research, he showed how to find three new quarks ( H+, H+2 and H2+ ) by solving the differential equations of the Schwinger–Gerlach constant that produced them and his telegram on 3 June 1928 expressing his complete agreement with the Standard Model. According to the theory, the transition from H+ to H2+ was not discovered until 1939 by the Argentine theoretical physicist Alfredo Rocha.  
 In 1941, he developed the so-called Dritsen fragment of the black hole and the Schwarzschild fragment.
