 = Eduard Riehl =  
Eduard August Josef Riehl ( 22 December 1849 – 9 April 1933 ) was a German painter and art historian, noted for his impressionistic paintings and his passion for the sciences.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Born in Halle an der Saale ( today's Czech Republic ), Riehl was educated at the Halle gymnasium and the Königsberg Academy, where his father was a student. In 1887, he enrolled at the University of Berlin and then entered the faculty of philosophy in 1889.Upon becoming a professor, Riehl devoted himself primarily to art and graduated in 1899. This friendship formed the basis of his collaboration with the mathematician August Otto von Hayek, the latter of whom he was a lifelong admirer. After his graduation, Riehl accepted an appointment as a professor at the University of Stuttgart and became an assistant professor in 1902, professor in 1905, and full professor in 1911.In 1896, he was appointed artistic director at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He held this position until 1910.In 1910, Riehl was appointed director of the Humboldt University of Berlin, a position which he held until 1916, when the university was transferred to Munich. The remainder of his career was spent at the Riehl-Koch-Werke Museum in Leipzig and the Institute for Historical Art and the Art of Guillaume-François Cabanis in London.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Influenced by the concepts of the German Romantic philosophy, Riehl took an interest in various branches of psychology and had a deeply significant influence on his successors in art. Riehl was a conservative member of the Société Impressionisme. In the field of mythology, he strove to find an identification between the expressive forms of the mythological images, as represented by the concrete sculptures, and the relations between thought and life in the painter's own consciousness.  
 In the influence of many influential early German romantic psychologists, such as Hermann Schelling and Carl Jung, Riehl wanted to pursue an interest in historical themes through his narrative. Riehl wrote a number of books on the theme of the history of art and ideas. His most influential works are Hermann Schelling and the Rhine : Die Weltkrankheit in der Hochschen Altertums ( 1900 ), and Deutschlands Geographie ( 1906 ). After suffering from various crises in his career, he was forced to resign from his chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and was succeeded by the theologian Josef Köhn, a man well versed in the study of German Romanticism and the philosophy of aesthetics, whose historiological style still remains influential.

Sonja Miková, Countess of Elsner ( 9 February 1794 – 16 August 1859 ) was a Slovene ducal lady, opera singer and chamber music teacher.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Miková was born in Hasenknecht, Budlina Province of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1797, her mother, the youngest daughter in her family, was expelled from the small town of Baden for having met a foreign gentleman. She then traveled to Vienna to study music with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. She continued her education in Berlin, Paris, and Salzburg, and joined the Royal Opera House where she received her doctorate in 1800. The following year, she was appointed curate of a convent in Alpenburg, then returned to Baden. In 1805, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar appointed her to a position as tutor in his court orchestra, but she soon rebelled against the discipline. Miková and the former Puntensina Sofia returned to Przemysl, a part of the Czech Kingdom. In 1808, the Count and Countess married. Following the Countess'death in 1812, Miková and the Countess lived in a small French town called Bonn. She did not make it to Bonn in time to take the title of countess. She died in Bonn in 1859.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 At the time, Miková and her brother-in-law decided to form a school. To this end, in 1802 they purchased a few sets of antique piano and violin instruments from `` The Best '' of Bohemia and Bohemia. On 1 June 1806, she completed a recital of Leibniz's tragedy Das Quatre Cantos ( 1776 ). In 1808, they purchased two pieces from the Malmö Conservatory and in 1813 acquired the Piano Sonata No. 4 by Tito de Occhi and the Violin Sonata No. 4 by Egon-Weser. In the latter, her brother-in-law used 15th-century style made famous by the 19th-century Viennese composer Ludovico Marić. In 1813, she and her brother-in-law opened the house for girls, forming a violist academy, a dancer academy, and a concert hall for young people. Her operas Die Walküre ( 1817 ) and Die Urwanderlohrer ( 1819 ) were among the opera work of the social movement.Miková taught later music at the Opera House in Bonn and at the Catholic college in Shlém.In 1810, Elsbeth Wilhelm von Ottberg gave birth to their son, Joseph, to Elsbeth and Alfred von Ottberg, also a singer. Her daughter Petra Gottlieb II was born the following year.

 = Klaus Abrahamsson =  
Klaus Abrahamsson ( 14 July 1870 – 25 January 1948 ) was a Swedish pacifist, Swedish Roman Catholic missionary, and professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Science and Letters, who became a notable figure in Sweden, and Scandinavia, in the twentieth century.Abrahamsson was born in Imberum, a small fishing village about 50 km southwest of Stockholm, in 1870. His parents were teachers at the hospital for poor children, and because he was orphaned, he had to learn the language at the primary school. He graduated from the Royal Academy of Sciences and Letters, and later studied medicine in Lund. In 1889, when he was 16, he became a medical teacher in Stockholm. In 1899 he became a priest, and in 1901 he was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest, becoming a canon of the Church of Sweden in 1891. He was the head of the health department of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kiel from 1901 to 1905, and from 1905 to 1912 was the auxiliary priest for the imperial town of Uppsala.  
 Abrahamsson's wife Sophie Dahlgren ( 17 January 1885 – 18 November 1960 ) was a primary school teacher and organist. He married Annie Nicolaen the same year, and together they had five children, including Anna Christian, who died in infancy and was cared for by Karl Abrahamsson.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === Vienna and Heidelberg ===  
 Abrahamsson travelled to Vienna in 1902, then in 1904, to Vienna, where he preached and promoted pacifist ideals and the `` rejuvenation of religions and its abolition of wars ''. He was appointed to the chair in theology at the University of Vienna.  
   
   
 === Stockholm ===  
 After his book For Peace on the Peace Syllabus published in 1900, Abrahamsson was called to the St. Magnus Theatre at Uppsala. The theatre in 1888 had been built by the Carl Wigner Society and was called the `` Königar ’ s Theater ''. Abrahamsson began preaching pacifism, and a rally of 200 people was held in front of the theatre.When World War I broke out in 1914, Abrahamsson led a delegation to the Balkans, which negotiated a ceasefire and sent Abrahamsson to the aid of foreign communities in the Balkans. Abrahamsson's visit in 1915 to Bosnia had a significant impact on the peace process there and helped with the reconstruction of the country after the war.  
   
   
 === Holy See and Uppsala ===  
 On 22 September 1905, Abrahamsson was appointed as the first Jesuit to become the Dean of Uppsala. When it became clear that Saint Benedict XIV was to succeed Pope Pius X, the future Pope Ferdinand X appointed him to the position. Abrahamsson attended papal conclaves in the Vatican and St. Peter's Square. During these papal meetings, he made many inroads in encouraging collaboration between the Vatican and other civil societies, like the Church of Sweden.

 = Giuseppe Tanca =  
Giuseppe Tanca ( 11 September 1782 – 24 July 1843 ) was an Italian naturalist, zoologist, and paleontologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Tanca was born in Lodi, where his family had settled several years before. His parents, Ademola Francesco Tanca ( 1782–1844 ) and Elena Tanca ( 1783–1843 ) were both wealthy and wealthy, having a clear taste for the well-being of the common person. Tanca's early life was spent in an Italian academy that was the leading institution of learning in Italy at the time.  
 The young Tanca could draw and use the most basic zoological knowledge. The chief problem to be solved was to see if any trace of fossil animals could be found in the Earth, at that time the most productive geological resources in the world. Tanca studied in the same gymnasium as other renowned naturalists, such as Sir Joseph Banks, Isaac Newton and Archibald Spencer.Tanca also studied physics and chemistry, and wrote short works on these subjects. After his graduation he joined the anatomical laboratory of the archaeologist J. Schleiermacher. This was an extraordinary laboratory for the time, being a state museum of Egypt, the discoverer of the First Pyramid of Giza.  
 At this time Tanca began to treat in much greater detail the phanerogams of insects. An opportunity to visit the ancient botanical garden of Florence's Scuola Sarmiento ( all around it were the preserved skeletons of more than 150 famous Lepidopterists, from around the world ) presented him with the idea of an expedition to Asia, a goal that aroused the excitement of the Florence Academy, and also provided him with an opportunity to collect as many insect fossils as possible. Before his departure for Asia, Tanca developed a theory of animal camouflage that was much more direct than the attempts by other investigators. The hypothesis predated Napoleonic campaigns in Asia. Its explanation was a reservoir of water that the insect hid in the larvae.  
 In early April 1804 Tanca and his scientific crew arrived at the site of the Pyramids of Giza. They found that the Sphinx had been reinforced with elaborate brickwork. Tanca completed his scientific work before leaving for Asia.  
 At his death in 1843 Tanca's collections reached an estimated 400,000 specimens.

 Hoppe , a merchant 's son from Vilsen , Hanover , began his career as a pharmacy apprentice in Celle , and subsequently was an assistant pharmacist in Hamburg , Halle , Wolfenbüttel and Regensburg . From 1792 onwards , he studied medicine and natural sciences at the University of Erlangen , and following graduation returned to Regensburg as a physician . Here he taught classes at the Regensburg lyceum .   
 He studied the flora of the Danube region surrounding Regensburg . In June 1798 he first explored the Untersberg massif near Salzburg , and almost each summer until 1843 continued his botanical excursions from Salzburg into the Eastern Alps . With bryologist Christian Friedrich Hornschuch ( 1793–1850 ) , he published a treatise involving an extended scientific journey to the Adriatic coast and the mountains of Carinthia and Tyrol , called `` Tagebuch einer Botanischen Reise nach den Küsten des Adriatischen Meeres und den Gebirgen von Kärnten , Tirol und Salzburg 1799 '' . He explored the region around Heiligenblut and the Grossglockner several times , where he found and described Eriophorum scheuchzeri , Sesleria ovata , Polytrichum sexangulare , Pedicularis asplenifolia , and Braya alpina .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 In May 1790 , Hoppe had founded the Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft ( Regensburg Botanical Society ) , the first botanical organization in Bavaria , and presently the world 's oldest existing botanical society . Notable members included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Alexander von Humboldt , and Justus von Liebig . From 1812 until his death in 1846 , Hoppe was its chairman .   
 He is credited for describing and naming over 200 plant species . Among his written efforts are a work on the flora of Regensburg , titled `` Ectypa plantarum ratisbonensium '' ( 1787–1793 ) , and `` Caricologia Germanica '' ( 1835 ) , a book of German caricology that he published with engraver Jacob Sturm ( 1771–1848 ) . From 1818 to 1842 , he was editor of the popular scientific journal Flora . In 1825 he collaborated with Christian Friedrich Hornschuch , Jacob Sturm and Jacob Johann Hagenbach to publish an illustrated work on Alpine beetles entitled Insecta Coleoptrata , quae in itineribus suis , praesertim alpinis.Hoppe became an elected member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1820 . The plant genus Hoppea from the family Gentianaceae is named after him .

His mother, Maria Theresa Görlitz, was a mother from northern Germany and a native of Derbes ( Derbek ).A study on spinal laxity, discovered by Ludwig Kramers, made him an early disciple of von Loeb's theory that every spinal mass can be attributed to an outside cause. As a youth, he devoted his spare time to improving his knowledge of medical subjects, which included pathological anatomy and anatomy of nervous and muscular bodies, such as the adrenal cortex. Noesen became a member of the Institut fur Anatomie der Naturkunde ( Institute of Animal Anatomy ) in 1846. In 1848, he was presented by Ferdinand Joseph De Roozendaal, the director of the institution to become medical director.  
 From 1852 onward, the Berlin law school of anatomy, physiology, and neurophysiology was held in association with the de Salvo and Wilhelm Wundt families, and Noesen served as a full professor there from 1868 to 1875.

Adèle Ollivier =  
Adèle Ollivier ( French : [ aɑːfʁɛ̃ fɛða ɛːvʁi ] ; 21 December 1835 in Meyrin – 10 April 1876 in Valence ) was a French classical music teacher and composer of the 19th century. In addition to composing works for the piano and organ, he is notable for the standard piano trios he composed between 1877 and 1879 under the pseudonyms Adèle Nadol, Adèle Dumoulin, and Adèle Morand-Séguin.  
 The strength of his voice lies in the way he can allow the guitar and the piano to thrive in a particular set of arrangements. The trios he composed with Nadol, Dumoulin, and Morand-Séguin are based on previously recorded pieces, and had the benefit of circulating in several major cities, often at the time when much of the music they were based on was being written and recorded.  
   
   
 == Education and early life ==  
   
   
 === Background ===  
 Adèle Ollivier was born in Meyrin, Brittany. He started his career in the music conservatory of the royal city of Valence. In 1867, his formative years, the `` Affaire de Musique '' was founded, founded in memory of Claude-Hugues Dicapie, and his teachers were determined to bring him closer to the choirs of the regnum des Theon. With the help of his brother-in-law, Léonard de Solberg, Ollivier began his studies of composition with Georges Bizet.  
   
   
 === Ministry ===  
 The Ministry of Music was in direct competition with the Choir of Valence, which became very popular.  
 After six years of working in the choirs, Ollivier was demoted to the rank of secretary in the Ministry of Music. After six years as a minister, he went to Paris, where he stayed for eleven years, starting in 1878. A later success was the establishment of the Conservatoire de Paris.  
   
   
 === Work and life ===  
 On 18 October 1878, Ollivier married Jacqueline, also from Meyrin, and soon after moved back to Paris to begin his studies. There he published a collection of simple songs called Contrêt de Jésus, which was published in 1890. He also wrote pieces for the piano. He also wrote for the opera Dieu du monde, and in 1906 he joined the cadenza school of music.On 3 June 1908, the second of the Concerts to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the Restoration, Ollivier succeeded Dicapie in the chair of the musical studies of the Conservatoire de Paris.The composer was given access to one of the most sophisticated sets of piano rolls ever assembled by composers, and his method, which included extended passages of repeated measures and successive notes, was lauded by George Massenet and W. H. Auden.In November 1907, Dicapie left the Conservatoire, and with it his new Ministry of Music. After that, Ollivier became head of the school of composition. He was under the great responsibility of one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart.  
   
   
 === Death and legacy ===  
 Ollivier died in Paris on 10 April 1876, aged 68. Ollivier left behind two daughters and six grandchildren. He left behind the operas Zappia and Il Moro and three symphonies ( Fantasie, The Rape of Lucrezia, Les Imaginations ). He was buried in Valence.

Josef Hlouch ( 26 March 1902 - 10 June 1972 ) was a Czech Roman Catholic prelate and theologian who served as the Bishop of Budweis from 1947 until his death . Hlouch first served as a parish priest and professor in Olomouc and other places before he was appointed to the episcopate following a standoff between ecclesial authorities and the Nazis as to whom would assume the Budweis episcopal see . He was installed in his new diocese at a time when communist authorities solidified their control over the then-Czechoslovakia which prompted Hlouch and other ecclesial leaders such as Josef Beran to speak out against communist repression . Hlouch was placed under house arrest and later exiled from his diocese but the Prague Spring allowed for him to return in 1968.The late bishop became known for his holiness and for his leadership of his old diocese and in 2015 the Czech Episcopal Conference lodged a formal request to Rome to open the beatification process . The process opened on 7 November 2017 and he became titled as a Servant of God .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Josef Hlouch was born in Lipník in the Třebíč District on 26 March 1902 to Jakub Hlouch and Marie Hlouchová .   
 In 1935 he obtained his doctorate in theological studies in Olomouc after having obtained his habilitation in 1934 . He received his ordination to the priesthood in mid-1926 in Olomouc from Archbishop Leopold Prečan . From 1945 until his episcopal appointment he served as a professor to seminarians after having served as a pastor since 1939 just before World War II began . In September 1928 he began serving as the parish administrator for the Hodolana parish in Olomouc .   
 Hlouch was later appointed as a bishop and received his episcopal consecration from Saverio Ritter in Olomouc with Josef Beran and Stanislav Zela serving as the co-consecrators .   
 His solemn enthronement in his episcopal see came as a relief to the faithful since the see had been vacant since 1940 . The Nazis had opposed a particular prelate nominated for the position leading to Pope Pius XII leaving the see vacant ; the Nazis defeat in 1945 allowed for Hlouch to be appointed as a bishop . His constant criticisms and opposition to the communist regime in the then-Czechoslovakia prompted his exile from the diocese . This was exacerbated when the authorities began monitoring all his activities after a 19 June 1949 sermon where he criticized the nation 's direction under the regime . He returned to his diocese on 9 June 1968 on the occasion of the Prague Spring . Hlouch had even been placed under house arrest in 1950 and in 1952 was arrested and then exiled from his diocese without a court trial . He left for several cities during this time first in Liberec and then in Mladá Vožice.In 1963 the facilitated negotiations between Pope John XXIII and the Czech Socialist Republic allowed for imprisoned bishops to be released . This prompted Hlouch 's release in April 1963 .   
 In 1968 he sent a letter to Miloslav Vlk in which he asked the then-deacon to become his personal aide . This was much to Vlk 's surprise who had hoped to go abroad for further studies . Prior to Vlk 's ordination he met with Hlouch in the bishopric for breakfast one morning where he spoke to the prelate about his plans for his future studies . Hlouch met with Vlk again one morning in the bishopric for breakfast two weeks later in which the latter assented to the role . Hlouch later ordained Vlk as a priest on 23 June 1968 .   
 Hlouch died on 10 June 1972 . His reputation for holiness had been noted in his life as well as for his gentle smile combined with his thoughtful nature . The communists did not allow for Pope Paul VI to name a successor which rendered the see vacant until Pope John Paul II appointed Miloslav Vlk as Hlouch 's successor .   
    
    
 == Beatification process ==   
 From 2012 the late bishop 's friend and aide Miloslav Vlk - now a cardinal - said that a beatification process could be launched because the potential for a formal application to Rome was something being evaluated . The Czech Episcopal Conference in autumn 2015 made a formal application to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to launch the cause with the C.C.S . issuing the `` nihil obstat '' decree on 7 November 2017 in a move that titled Hlouch as a Servant of God.The diocesan process to collect documentation and witness testimonies is expected to be launched sometime in 2018 .

 = Carl Friedrich Konrad Vollmer =  
Carl Friedrich Konrad Vollmer ( 30 May [ O.S. 3 May ] 1768 in Würzburg, Bavaria – 13 January 1811 in Munich, Germany ) was a German anatomist and lithographer, best known as an inventor of the Vollmer tube.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life and education ===  
 Born on 30 May 1768, he grew up near Würzburg in eastern Bavaria. He was educated at the University of Würzburg from 1790 to 1793. He attended lectures of 1792 and 1795 at the lectures of the physiologist and anatomist Christian Wilhelm Thiele at the University of Tübingen.  
   
   
 === Career ===  
 Vollmer's career, which began in the year 1792, was a difficult one. The monetary situation of the time made it difficult for talented young men to be sent to study medicine.  
 Because of his poor health, Vollmer completed his dissertation in 1798 at the University of Tübingen. He gave lectures on anatomy at the Teubner-Schule in 1805. That year, however, his health failed. In January 1806, he left Germany for the first time.  
 During this period, he experimented with both microscopes and an instrument for quickly tracing microvascular changes.  
   
   
 === Biography ===  
 As a result of his lectures and work, in 1812 Vollmer was hired as a lecturer at the University of Münster, where his lectures were notably wide-ranging. He used the microscope to determine the rectum. This turned out to be a good tool for reconstructing anatomy ; it was specially trained to use a microscope. But Vollmer was eager to learn anatomy, and was never satisfied with what he learned.  
 In 1813, Vollmer was a posthumously appointed professor at the University of Tübingen. Here, he met André Messner. Messner spent a year teaching at the university, and led Vollmer's early anatomical students on their studies of the lungs and other organs. In 1815, Vollmer was made a full professor, and the following year, he was named rector of the Gymnasium of Tübingen.  
 In 1816 Vollmer became president of the Volksbücher ( The Society of Bacteriologists ) ; he helped to expand the standard of knowledge regarding bacteria and eventually is credited as having laid the foundations of current microscopic microbiology.  
   
   
 === Later life ===  
 In 1823, his wife, Ursula Verkoper, moved to England. The next year, Vollmer married Constance Kreft, the daughter of an unsuccessful clergyman. They had six children.  
 As a result of his work, many later scientists, physicians and teachers would repeat Vollmer's discoveries. In his paper `` On the Gastrocnemius Rectum '' published in 1826, Vollmer wrote :  
   
 This anatomical system is based upon certain facts : that the Nucleus of the Gastrocnemius circumscribed by Messner is the external junction of the different organs and its five subvening alimentary productions, the Axillary-Carca, the Cryptogastric-Adrenal, the Adenosine-Adrenal, the Poppy-Choroidal-Nucleus, and the Cholera-Canceric ; that the proximal part of the Urinary-Vascular-Body is the tubular secretion from the several lymphatic cells which are in great abundance throughout the body ; that this secretion is the centre of fermentation in all the Clitocytotenyes of which we are aware, as they give the cause of the fermentation ; that the discharging division of this secretion from all the obstructed portions makes the ultimate separation of the small number of Jars-pairs which are placed in the genital glands ; and, finally, that the sexual relation is a product of the internal structure rather than of the external operation.  
   
 Vollmer died in Munich in 1811.

 = Lev Pontryagin =   
Lev Semyonovich Pontryagin ( Russian : Лев Семёнович Понтрягин , also written Pontriagin or Pontrjagin ) ( 3 September 1908 – 3 May 1988 ) was a Soviet mathematician . He was born in Moscow and lost his eyesight due to a primus stove explosion when he was 14 . Despite his blindness he was able to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century , partially with the help of his mother Tatyana Andreevna who read mathematical books and papers ( notably those of Heinz Hopf , J. H. C. Whitehead , and Hassler Whitney ) to him . He made major discoveries in a number of fields of mathematics , including algebraic topology and differential topology .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Pontryagin worked on duality theory for homology while still a student . He went on to lay foundations for the abstract theory of the Fourier transform , now called Pontryagin duality . With René Thom , he is regarded as one of the co-founders of cobordism theory , and co-discoverers of the central idea of this theory , that framed cobordism and stable homotopy are equivalent . This led to the introduction around 1940 of a theory of certain characteristic classes , now called Pontryagin classes , designed to vanish on a manifold that is a boundary . In 1942 he introduced the cohomology operations now called Pontryagin squares . Moreover , in operator theory there are specific instances of Krein spaces called Pontryagin spaces .   
 Later in his career he worked in optimal control theory . His maximum principle is fundamental to the modern theory of optimization . He also introduced there the idea of a bang-bang principle , to describe situations where either the maximum 'steer ' should be applied to a system , or none.Pontryagin authored several influential monographs as well as popular textbooks in mathematics .   
    
 Pontryagin 's students include Dmitri Anosov , Vladimir Boltyansky , Revaz Gamkrelidze , Evgeni Mishchenko , Mikhail Postnikov , Vladimir Rokhlin , and Mikhail Zelikin .   
    
    
 == Controversy and anti-semitism allegations ==   
 Pontryagin was accused of anti-Semitism on several occasions . For example , he attacked Nathan Jacobson for being a `` mediocre scientist '' representing the `` Zionism movement '' , while both men were vice-presidents of the International Mathematical Union . He rejected charges of anti-Semitism in an article published in Science in 1979 , claiming that he struggled with Zionism , which he considered a form of racism . When a prominent Soviet Jewish mathematician , Grigory Margulis , was selected by the IMU to receive the Fields Medal at the upcoming 1978 ICM , Pontryagin , who was a member of the Executive Committee of the IMU at the time , vigorously objected . Although the IMU stood by its decision to award Margulis the Fields Medal , Margulis was denied a Soviet exit visa by the Soviet authorities and was unable to attend the 1978 ICM in person .   
 Pontryagin also participated in a few notorious political campaigns in the Soviet Union , most notably , in the Luzin affair .

 = Theophilus Crossley =  
Theophilus Crossley FRS ( 9 May 1753 – 22 January 1819 ) was a British classical scholar and a pioneering physician. He is best remembered for his work as an external examiner for Joseph Priestley's Lyceum, an examinations for places as a Principal at Corpus Christi College. He was also one of the founders of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1799, and served as President of the society in 1811.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Crossley was born to James Crossley, an estate agent, and his wife Katherine Anne, née Goodman, née Goll, in Cheltenham, England. Crossley was educated at King's College, London ( where he studied mathematics under David Saltpetre ), and University College, Cambridge ( where he was director of the mathematics department ), both during the 1760s and 1770s.  
   
   
 == Training and ordination ==  
 Crossley's research interests included botany, geography and historical geography, astronomy, history of medicine, and optics.  
 He was a member of the first `` English Masons '' called `` Temples of England '', and of the `` second generation of Jesuit interpreters '' known as the `` Scots ``, an Anglo-Scottish Masonic order founded in 1694 by Henry Clarke, one of the three founders of the `` Church of England '' ( `` Church of Scotland '' ). An inquest into the death of Henry Sewell demonstrated that all three founded the `` Church of Scotland '', and that Sewell was the first person who attained the title `` Master Mason '' in England, in 1694, as stated by the Church of England Masons Magazine.  
 Crossley took a year's dismission as a `` newly applied sciences '' at the college in 1765, and attended the Provincial's Degree in Physiology, New College, 1812. Crossley is known to have received the degree by one of the `` young students '' at New College who was aiming to become an examiner for the lyceum.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Crossley became familiar with the work of Joseph Priestley and was a supporter of his new policy. Crossley was appointed an examiner for the lyceum in 1767. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1768. He was sent to the Institute of Medical Science in 1773 and returned to the Lyceum as an external examiner in 1786.  
 Crossley was the founding editor of the Dictionary of Physiology, and made one of the first observations on the `` Dynamic Motion of the Gas Initiating a Blood Pool, on which he had made some of the first calculations... while in the service of the Ministry of Pain ''.He was one of the original members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and was elected Fellow in 1811.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
   
 In 1802, Crossley was one of the 20 doctors elected as the winners of the Society for Nomenclature of Useful and Useful Names. For his candidature, he was awarded the Order of the Bath ( CB ) by the regent, Edward III in 1802.

Prof Peter W. Gale FRS ( 11 November 1911 – 5 January 2001 ) was an Australian physicist and physicist, who made important contributions to the field of string theory. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the son of Sydney instrument maker John Gale ( 1875–1928 ) and his wife Catherine Hay ( 1884–1952 ). Peter was educated at the University of Sydney and graduated B.A. in Physics from the University of Melbourne in 1938.  
 At the start of the Second World War, he was an instructor in British science at Guy's Hospital, London. During the war he was an RAF demonstrator at Ophir Lightfield but was badly damaged in a plane crash. He returned to Australia, but he suffered from Parkinson's disease and moved to the United States. Gale initially was considered for the position of researcher at British radio as part of the plans for Australia's first commercial atomic weapons development. He subsequently became a member of the BBC Radio Advisory Committee.  
 He died at Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, on 5 January 2001. He is survived by his wife, seven children and six grandchildren.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Gale married Mary White ( 1881–1971 ), a college librarian and lecturer at Sydney University and one of the first women appointed a lecturing fellow by the university. The two had two sons, D. Gale ( b. 1892 ) and J. Gale ( b. 1896 ). Gale married Laura Holloway ( 1903–2001 ), sister of nuclear physicist Kenneth Holloway.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Gale's interests were in astronomy and physics, and he was a significant discoverer of a dataframe for the Cassini Spacecraft. He developed a numerical method for identifying extraterrestrial intelligence which has been referred to as his `` New Think Engine ''.  
 The series of papers he wrote under the initials P.W. Gale are considered seminal in the field of string theory, with later contributions made by such authors as C.H. Nie and Robert Rabi.Several of his papers are listed in the Cambridge University Semiconductor Collection under the heading `` The Hidden Code ''.The most significant recent written work by P.W. Gale was a series of articles on cross-collisions between fundamental particles and ensembles of particles and loosely interleaved collisions. These papers constitute the scientific foundation of the field of string theory and were published in the Journal of Physikalische Intersubjects. The calculations made by Gale in this paper led to significant progress towards the theory of quark–gluon plasma structure.

Henno Martin ( 15 March 1910 – 7 January 1998 ) was a German professor of geology who , along with Hermann Korn , lived for two years in the Namib Desert to avoid internment during the Second World War .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
    
 Martin was born in Freiburg , Germany on 15 March 1910 . His studies at the universities of Bonn , Zürich , and Göttingen culminated in a Ph.D on `` Post-Archean Tectonics in Southern Central Sweden '' . In 1935 he emigrated along with Korn to what was then South-West Africa ( now Namibia ) ( a former German colony ) and worked as a consulting geologist . Namibia was at that time administered by its neighbor , South Africa and in 1939 South Africa , following the United Kingdom , declared war on Germany . In 1940 , fearing internment as enemy aliens by the South African government , Martin and Korn decided to flee into the Namib desert and to wait out the war in the remote and rugged Kuiseb Canyon . They returned to Windhoek in 1942 after Korn contracted beri-beri . They were not interned on their return and before the war ended were employed as surveyors by the government . In 1957 Martin wrote The Sheltering Desert , a memoir of his experiences while living in the Namib . The work was first published in German and has been translated into other languages . A 1992 film covers the story .

 Martin discovered the Messum crater in 1939 , the Namibian remainder of a gigantic volcanic eruption that happened before Africa and South America broke apart . This eruption is thought to have been the single largest explosive volcanic eruption in the history of the Earth.After the war he worked as a consulting geologist , specialising in exploration for underground water resources . He selected the locations of boreholes throughout South-West Africa and particularly in the capital Windhoek , where he `` provided the city with its first large-scale , reliable source of water '' .Martin worked for 20 years as Director of the Geological Survey of Namibia . In 1963 he joined the University of Cape Town as director of the Precambrian Research Unit , and in 1964 he became Head of Geology at University of Göttingen.The Geological Society of Namibia , whose honorary patron Martin was , awards the Henno Martin Medal annually for the best scientific publication by a geologist living in Namibia .

 == Biography ==   
 Parker was born in London on 17 October 1850 ; his father was the anatomist William Kitchen Parker . He studied at Clarendon House School and graduated from the University of London in 1868.At the age of 22 , he worked with Thomas Henry Huxley in Huxley 's zoological demonstrations , forming a teaching collection and organising laboratory practicals . Huxley 's work on crayfish kindled in Parker an interest in crustaceans , and he went on to study the marine `` crayfish '' ( spiny lobsters ) of New Zealand , together with his student Josephine Gordon Rich , who later married William Aitcheson Haswell.On 23 December 1874 , Thomas Jeffery Parker married Charlotte Elizabeth Rossell in Bramley , Yorkshire . In 1880 , they emigrated to New Zealand . Parker become Professor of Zoology at the University of Otago in Dunedin , succeeding Frederick Wollaston Hutton . He was also curator of the Otago Museum , and was `` the first trained biologist in the colony '' .   
    
 Parker sent a display of a series of skulls to the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880 , which was later reused in the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin . The display used coloured wires and painted bones to show the evolution of the vertebrate skull . Indeed , Parker was noted by a Tuapeka Times correspondent as having a `` mania for skeletons ... [ and ] has procured some splendid and interesting specimens of birds and fish . '' In 1883 , Parker obtained a fin whale specimen from Captain William Jackson Barry , who had himself bought and exhibited it in Nelson . The fin whale skeleton is still a central feature of the current Maritime Gallery .   
 Parker was made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1888.In his later years , Parker suffered from diabetes , and he died on 7 November 1897 at Warrington . After his death , Parker was succeeded at the University of Otago by William Blaxland Benham .

 Parker produced more than 40 scientific papers . They include nine papers on moas published between 1889 and 1895 , and a 100-page monograph on the history of the kiwi , which was later condensed into two articles in the New Zealand Journal of Science . Parker identified a new species of sea cucumber ( Chirodota dunedinensis , now Taeniogyrus dunedinensis ) soon after arriving in Dunedin . Despite living in different countries , Parker wrote an introductory textbook on zoology together with William Aitcheson Haswell , which continued to be used into the 1960s .

 == Early life ==  
 Holt was born in Portland, Oregon. He was one of three children born to Horace Holt, the official manager of the Portland Public Schools, and Mary Olivia Norton. His parents were both from Michigan. He attended Portland State Normal School, a prestigious private school in Portland, where his mentor, Louis Berger, served as Principal. The young man was also tutored by many notable musicians, such as Sidney Bechet, Walter Jennings, and Clara Zohn. He graduated from the prestigious Portland Musical Academy, and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.Holt's parents sent him to a boarding school at Northville, Massachusetts. The school had many members of musical talent, such as conductor Joseph Coleman, jazz scholar Henry C. Hodges, the noted music critic William McDonough, and the organist J. Howard Phillips. These prominent members of the music scene impressed Holt with their praise for his talents and ability to blend them with the rest of the staff.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1874, Holt enrolled at Cornell University, graduating with a degree in musical composition in 1875. He then went on to study privately at the Juilliard School in New York City with Eugene Weismann.  
 He then spent the next three years in Europe, returning to America in 1877, when he finally enrolled at the Boston Conservatory of Music in New York City. He studied harmony and composition under the noted flautist Robert Saramago for two years, before returning to his home country in 1880. He then moved to Paris to teach, becoming a visiting professor at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1891.  
 In 1894 he returned to the United States, settling in Boston as Professor of Music at Harvard College. Holt became the head of the Music Department at Harvard in 1899 and held that position until his retirement in 1935.  
 From 1900 to 1926, he was the Director of the Boston Public School Orchestra, which is still organized today as the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He also served as the music director for Columbia University from 1896 until his death in 1951. Holt's mastery of the most important music of the time are recognized in Boston with his famous teacher and brother Philip.  
   
   
 == Patreus Holt prize ==  
   
 His famous collaboration with Richard Strauss on Strauss's work Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 1 and King's Suite in E minor, is called the Patreus Holt Prize. This prize is awarded annually by the Boston Society of Music. It is instituted by the Society in his honor.  
   
   
 == Trivia ==  
 Holt's name is the only composition that is named after himself. This is true of his scores for piano, cello, and orchestra, a composer named Per Hof and the Piano Sonata No. 1, and the New England String Quartet's Martin Luther King Jr. trios, and the Wurlitzer Trio and Trio for horn and piano.  
 Holt's father was a successful lawyer who lived in Portland, Oregon. His brother Pat was a notable professor and music educator at the Juilliard School.  
 There was a 1909 portrait of Holt that was held by the Boston Society of Music, but was later destroyed. It was recovered in 2002. It includes, `` King's violin, which he conducted as an assistant at the 1894 New York World Columbian Exposition ; he was the first to play the violin in America ; [ his cousin James A. Holt, B.A., on the wrong side ] played the violin at the 1904 World's Fair in Chicago ; and [ he is ] the inventor of the Bollard-Holt pendulum. '' There is a photograph of him and his sister Margaret Holt in a photo album of Boston Society of Music members.His former student and Harvard professor Vivian Russell Hall, who won an award for Chopin's violin concerto written by Holt in 1893, has been credited with an undiscovered Bach Sonata for Strings, by the phrase `` In my day [ t ] he love of wit is as old as the light that burns ''.

Sir ( Ambrose ) Thomas Stanton ( 14 November 1875 – 25 January 1938 ) was a Canadian surgeon , entomologist and health administrator who helped to identify the cause of beri-beri . He later became Chief Medical Adviser to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies .   
 He was born in the village of Kendal , Durham County , Ontario to storekeeper Thomas Stanton and educated at the local Port Hope High School on the north shore of Lake Ontario . After graduating from Trinity Medical College , Toronto in 1899 , he worked as a house surgeon at The Hospital for Sick Children and Toronto General Hospital before becoming surgeon on a liner in 1901 . In 1905 he moved to England to continue his medical studies at University College and the London Hospital , earning a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene ( DTM & H ) in 1906 . He joined the Hospital for Tropical Diseases as a house surgeon , rising to registrar , and also taught at the London School of Tropical Medicine.In 1907 he left to work in Malaya with Henry Fraser at the Institute for Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur on a project to investigate the cause of beri-beri , a debilitating disease which afflicted the local people . He   
 lived for nearly a year in a remote part of the jungle where a new road was being constructed . There he arranged that one group of labourers were supplied with a diet of polished rice and another group with unpolished rice . When the group fed on polished rice developed beri-beri they were able to deduce that beri-beri was a disease of the metabolism caused by a dietary deficiency related to the rice polishing process . The unpolished rice was subsequently found to contain trace amounts of alcohol-soluble substances , later to be known as vitamins , and in particular of vitamin B1.He was also a keen entomologist and did important work on the identification and classification of mosquitos and mosquito larvae . When an outbreak of a new disease in the Malayan rubber plantations occurred in 1917 he was able to identify the cause as an outbreak of melioidosis , caused by a bacterial contamination of groundwater .   
 In 1920 he was put in charge of the Institute and in 1926 made the first Chief Medical Officer at the Colonial Office , where he advised the Secretary of State for the Colonies on medical matters affecting some fifty crown colonies and protectorates.He served on several committees such as the Colonial Advisory Medical Committee and the managing committee of the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases . He was also a board member of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the councils of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association .

John Tradescant the Younger ( ; 4 August 1608 – 22 April 1662 ) , son of John Tradescant the Elder , was a botanist and gardener . The standard author abbreviation Trad . is applied to species he described .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Son of John Tradescant the Elder , he was born in Meopham , Kent , and educated at The King 's School , Canterbury . Like his father , who collected specimens and rarities on his many trips abroad , he undertook collecting expeditions to Virginia between 1628 and 1637 ( and possibly two more trips by 1662 , though Potter and other authors doubt this ) . Among the seeds he brought back , to introduce to English gardens were great American trees , including magnolias , bald cypress and tulip tree , and garden plants such as phlox and asters .   
 John Tradescant the Younger added his American acquisitions to the family 's cabinet of curiosities , known as The Ark . These included the ceremonial cloak of Chief Powhatan , an important Native American relic . South Lambeth Road in Vauxhall was one of the boundaries of the Tradescant estate , where the collection was kept and Tradescant Road was laid out after the estate was built on in the late 1800s and named after the family .   
 When his father died , he succeeded as head gardener to Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France , making gardens at the Queen 's House , Greenwich , designed by Inigo Jones , from 1638 to 1642 , when the queen fled the Civil War . He published the contents of his father 's celebrated collection as Musaeum Tradescantianum—books , coins , weapons , costumes , taxidermy , and other curiosities—dedicating the first edition to the Royal College of Physicians ( with whom he was negotiating for the transfer of his botanic garden ) , and the second edition to the recently restored Charles II . Tradescant bequeathed his library and museum to ( or some say it was swindled from him by ) Elias Ashmole ( 1617–1692 ) , whose name it bears as the core of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford where the Tradescant collections remain largely intact .   
 He was buried beside his father in the churchyard of St-Mary-at-Lambeth which is now established as the Garden Museum .   
 He is the subject of the novel Virgin Earth by Philippa Gregory , sequel to Earthly Joys about his father .

 = Saul Rosenzweig =   
Saul Rosenzweig ( 1907–2004 ) was an American psychologist and therapist who studied subjects such as repression , psychotherapy , and aggression . Rosenzweig , who , with a co-author , has been credited with being the first to attempt to `` elicit repression '' in a laboratory setting , became well known after publishing a paper discussing `` common factors '' underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Rosenzweig , a friend and classmate of B.F. Skinner , earned his doctorate from Harvard College in 1932 . He worked at Worcester State Hospital and Clark University before becoming the chief psychologist at the Western State Psychiatric Institute.Rosenzweig taught at Washington University in St. Louis from 1948 until he retired in 1975 .   
 He died on August 9 , 2004 , at the age of 97 .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 In the 1930s , Rosenzweig studied repression . With G. Mason , Rosenzweig criticized H. Meltzer 's survey of studies of repression in an article published in the British Journal of Psychology . Rosenzweig and Mason argued that the studies reviewed by Meltzer worked with sensory stimuli unrelated to the theory of repression , and `` failed to develop under laboratory control the experiences which are subsequently to be tested for recall . '' Donald W. MacKinnon and William F. Dukes credit Rosenzweig and Mason with being `` the first to make an explicit attempt to elicit repression under conditions of laboratory control and observation . '' Sigmund Freud was sent reprints of Rosenzweig 's attempts to study repression , but replied to Rosenzweig that while he had examined his `` experimental studies for the verification of the psychoanalytic assertions with interest '' he could not `` put much value on these confirmations because the wealth of reliable observations on which these assertions rest make them independent of experimental verification . `` Rosenzweig became well known after publishing a paper discussing `` common factors '' underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy . He argued that all models of therapy could be equally successful , due to competent therapists sharing common factors that aided their patients . His premise became known as the Dodo Bird Verdict or Dodo Bird Hypothesis — a reference to Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland ( 1865 ) , in which a dodo bird declares at the end of a race designed to dry everyone off : `` Everybody has won and all must have prizes . `` Rosenzweig 's study of aggression led to the development of the Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study , a test of latent hostility . The Rosenzweig Picture Frustration Study is usually considered a semi-projective technique and involves an examinee responding verbally to a semi-ambiguous picture scenario . Each of the three forms ( child , adolescent , and adult ) consists of 24 comic strip pictures that portray a situation that might induce frustration . The overall purpose of the study is to assess how the examinee responds to frustration and frustrating situations . The test assumes that the way that the examinee responds to each frustrating situation depicts how they behave in the face of frustration . The worth of this test is based on how aggression is conceptualized into three types . The first direction of aggression can be extragressive meaning that it is turned onto the environment . The second direction is intraggressive meaning that it is turned by the examinee onto the self . The final direction is imaggressive which means that it is evaded in an attempt to gloss over the frustration . In terms of reliability and validity , the P-F Study interscorer reliability is in the range of .80 to .85 . The test-retest reliability is fair to marginal . The test became popular in Europe and was featured in Stanley Kubrick 's film A Clockwork Orange ( 1971 ) .A collection of Rosenzweig 's papers has been maintained in the Archives of the History of American Psychology , at the University of Akron . This comprises a collection of papers from 1929 to 2003 , in five series :

 == Biography ==   
 Born on June 30 , 1923 in Porto San Giorgio , Italy , in 1928 she migrated with her family in Australia because of the political situation in Italy ; Nibbi grew up in Melbourne with an English education .   
 In 1947 , after the war and the fall of fascism , Nibbi and her family temporarily returned to Italy , and here she got married . In 1963 she came again to Italy and during the journey she joined an excursion in Egypt , where she became fascinated by ancient Egyptian civilization at the point that once in Italy she started to study archaeology at the University of Perugia and later graduated at the University of Florence .   
 Shortly after , Nibbi had to left Italy for Oxford , England . In 1969 she published the Etruscans-themed The Tyrrhenians , but a certain notoriety only came in 1972 with the self-published The Sea–Peoples : A Re-examination of the Egyptian Sources , in which she suggested that `` the Great Green '' mentioned in Egyptian records should not be identified with the Mediterranean Sea as usually done but rather with the verdant Nile Delta , and that ancient Egyptians were not as much a seafaring civilization as thought ; at the time the book and the conclusions within were widely panned by mainstream academics .   
 Since the journals started to refuse publishing her works , in 1985 Nibbi founded her own review , the still-running Discussions in Egyptology , on which she published her successive studies on ancient Egyptian geography centering on her reinterpretation of some narratives involving seafaring , such as the Story of Wenamun . In order to finding evidences for her claims , Nibbi excavated in various Egyptian coastal locations such as Mersa Matruh looking for anchors and other ancient naval technology.Alessandra Nibbi died on January 15 , 2007 in Oxford , aged 83 .

 = L. E. Winslow =  
John Edwin `` Bob '' Winslow ( April 3, 1937 – April 15, 1998 ) was an American wildlife biologist and explorer. He led the Great Lakes Biological Station, an early and successful scientific research station in the Lake Superior area, working closely with scientists such as Michael D'Arcy Wadsworth and John G. Friese.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Bob Winslow was born on April 3, 1937 in Cleveland, Ohio, to owners George `` Bob '' and Caroline ( Charles ) Winslow, the son of Donald W. Winslow, a teacher and businessman.  
 In 1971, at the age of 20, he embarked on his exploration career and eventually led the Great Lakes Biological Station, located at the Muskegon Conference Center in Muskegon, Michigan. It was operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, with the goal of studying and protecting the land, animals, and natural resources of Lake Superior and the surrounding area. After World War II, funding to support the station was more than possible, but the vast majority of funding was provided by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and by private donations. Worshipful donations from the Texas-based Bishop Barney Flood funded the early period. Despite years of trying, and extensive staff and equipment spending, the station's first expedition to the region, in 1977, was unsuccessful. In 1980, the station was refitted with a searchlight and twenty television cameras and fourteen remote-controlled aircraft, among other equipment.In the 1980s, he led the Great Lakes Biological Station when it was absorbed into the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. The base remained in Woods Hole until 1986, before being merged with the University of Michigan Institute of Oceanography in Ann Arbor. His supervisor at the Institute was the leading marine biologist and ecologist of his day, Michael D'Arcy Wadsworth. He also advised regional fisheries on biological conservation, work with scientific expeditions to animal husbandry, fish biology, and geological and paleoecological research.  
 During the mid-1980s, he joined its Thunderbird Substation in the Grand Marais Experimental Reserve, for which he became director from 1990 to 1995. He was responsible for the Wildlife Research Station and the Bay of Fundy Substation, and also lead the Muskegon Substation. He is best known for creating the geology part of the Great Lakes Biological Station ( GMBS ) and other expeditions. He died of heart failure at the age of 84. His unpublished books and articles are among the numerous documentation and artifacts in the Great Lakes Biological Station collections, as well as some of the science experiments and works of the Great Lakes Substation at the University of Michigan.One of the scientists working with the station at its zenith, writing in The Biologist in 1984, said that his contribution to the field was the creation and management of a model substation—two hundred of the best-equipped and most capable 'land mammal station'ever built—which greatly expanded ecological sampling of natural areas around Muskegon, Lake Superior, and the Lower Great Lakes. He also wrote that his predecessor, Prof. W. Christopher Whipple of the United States Department of Agriculture's Fish and Wildlife Service, `` spent half a million dollars and spent ten years establishing a large laboratory in most of Michigan and Oklahoma. ''  
 He also wrote, `` The potential of Lake Superior '' was highlighted by Wyno M. Minklum-Leach in The Ecologist.  
   
   
 == Other contributions ==  
 His two areas of focus, interest in wildlife breeding, and research on waterway sedimentary features, are cited by Richard Frey on his environmental questions, Watersheds : The Story of Fish ( N.Y. : Macmillan, 1997 ). He also made significant contributions in `` Physical anthropology of fisheries '', along with a high energy study of finfish and two Pacific walleyes ( 2006 ), both of which were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.  
 He also helped refine and publish six influential major scientific journals, including the journals of biology, palaeobiology, and entomology. He was editor-in-chief of the quarterly journal Current Biology from 1988 to 1996, the journal of Biology from 1994 to 1996, and the journal of Marine and Freshwater Sciences from 1993 to 1999.Winslow and Larry Buttric founded the Great Lakes Association of Women in Biology.

 = Valdemar Adolph Thisted =   
Valdemar Adolph Thisted ( 28 February 1815 – 14 October 1887 ) was a Danish writer , translator and priest . His works include novels , travelogues , romantic dramas and theological polemics . The writings published during his time as a pastor caused a stir because of their critical views on contemporary church issues . He is best known among English readers for his novel Letters from Hell .   
    
    
 == Life and works ==   
 Valdemar Adolph Thisted was the son of Jorgen Thisted ( 1795–1855 ) , Lieutenant and later vicar of Gyrstinge and Flinterup , and Marie Elmquist ( 1790–1829 ) . He was born in Aarhus . After his mother ’ s early death , when he was twelve years old , he moved to the home of his uncle , the War Commissioner of Elmquist in Aarhus , and attended the town 's grammar school .   
 Before he began his theological studies in Copenhagen , he was for a time tutor in a manor house . Upon graduation in 1840 , he set up a boys ’ school in Skanderborg and in 1846 a secondary school . He later became an assistant professor in a secondary school in Aarhus , resigning in 1853 . In 1855 he began ministering in northern Schleswig . After suffering a nervous weakness , and a fall that required him to use crutches , he resigned in 1870 and moved to Frederiksberg .   
 Thisted was married twice . His first marriage was to Henriette Hansen ( 1815–1904 ) , a sister of the painter Constantin Hansen , and was dissolved . His second marriage was to Elisha Rasmussen ( 1830–1901 ) , who became completely paralyzed for 30 years .   
 Thisted made his literary debut with the novel Vandring i Syden ( Wandering in the South ) , published in 1843 . The following year he began the first of his travels to Southern Europe . His subsequent works included Havfruen ( Little Mermaid , 1846 ) , Tabt og funden ( Lost and Won , 1849 ) , Episoder fra et Reiseliv ( Episodes from a Reiseliv,1850 ) and Romerske Mosaiker ( Roman Mosaics , 1851 ) , the fruits of a journey to Italy ; the novel Sirenernes Ö ( Siren 's Island , 1853 ) ; the romantic dramas Hittebarnet ( Abandoned Child,1854 ) , Neapolitaniske Aquareller ( 1853 ) and Hjemme og paa Vandring ( Home and on Hiking , 1854 ) ; novelistic travel studies Örkenens Hjerte ( Örkenens Heart , 1849 ) , Bruden ( Bride,1851 ) and the novel Familieskatten ( Family Tax , 1856 ) .   
 He published a volume of poems with religious and patriotic sentiments in 1862 .   
 His novel Breve fra Helvede ( Briefe aus der Hölle ) , published in Copenhagen in 1866 , excited considerable attention and was translated into several languages . The sensuality that coloured his previous works has a stronger suit in these Letters and certainly contributed to their success . It is his only work to have been translated into English , although a number of his works were translated into German .   
 Worried by the offence caused by the book , Thisted made a kind of penance in Høgholt ( 1868 ) , some colorless , religious parables . Høgholt was Thisted 's last work . A nerve weakness compelled him to give up both office and authorship . He moved 1870 to Frederiksberg , where he spent his seventeen years ' retirement plagued by illness and bitterness at the absence of the recognition he thought he deserved . He was buried in Haderslev .   
 At its best , his work is characterised by a vivid descriptive power and rich fantasy but also suffers from monotony and prolixity . Thisted also wrote under the pseudonyms Emanuel St. Hermidad , Herodion and M.Rowel .

Hugh DeWitt Frost ( February 3, 1915 – October 17, 1988 ) was a Canadian historian, archaeologist, author and professor of Celtic languages and literature. He was the creator of the Cross of Leinster and the Gleanings of Ireland series of novels.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Frost was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His father was George William Frost, an officer with the Winnipeg Artillery and a major figure in the Anglo-Canadian Confederation. His mother was Annie Louise Little, a grandmother who had a young son, whom she referred to as `` Johnny Frost ''.Frost completed his secondary education at the Royal Northern College in Winnipeg. In 1948 he married Ida Flowers at the summer celebration of the College's centennial. After graduating in 1949, he took a position at the Dalhousie University of Newfoundland. In 1953 he accepted the chair of Irish at Dalhousie. In 1961 he was made a founding member of the Balfour Club. He was also the past president of the modern Irish Historical Society, of the historical section of the History of Ireland program at the University of St Andrews.  
   
   
 == Creative works ==  
 The sixth volume of the First Banner of Ireland series was produced under Frost's leadership and contained a 25-page introduction to the series, and The Bear Castle by Arthur Conan Doyle in the foreword. In 1951 he co-authored a non-fiction book about Dalhousie, Ilsa's Cave.  
 In 1994 he co-wrote the novel Campionire with John Lindsay titled Covering the Mountain. This was a fictionalized history of Garrison, Ontario. Frost's novel The Last Days of the Chief, published in 1995 was based on the works of William Le Banton and was set in New Ireland in the late 17th century. It has been criticized for having mixed historical and personal meaning. The song `` The Last Days of the Chief '' by the Ballykenny `` Bar None '' Boys is included in the song `` Bear Castle ''.

He was educated at the parish school in Argyll and then, in 1891, at St. Andrews Grammar School in Edinburgh.Wilson studied at the University of Edinburgh graduating M.A. in 1894, M.S. in 1900 and M.Sc. in 1905.Following an examination at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1896, he was appointed Demonstrator in Geology by Sir Archibald Heyns, Director of the Royal Geological Survey ( see Geological map of Scotland ), and went on to study at the University of Edinburgh for a total of six years. He then went on to teach at University College, London and the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth.In 1903 he joined the Geological Survey of Scotland and served for thirty years. His work, in which he developed the work of fossil geologist William Greer Smyth on the microscopic structures of the Silurian, was further influential on modern geology.  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 As well as the first-hand knowledge of geological matters from dealing with Silurian rocks, Wilson found many of Greer Smyth's seminal works to be derived from surveying in caves. While he proved correct in his geological maps of Scotland ( Wilson 2000 ), Smyth's maps, it is said, began to be identified with a style of map-making which Wilson was not keen on.

 == Early years ==  
 Herbert Victor Norlin was born in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania to United States Army Major Wilbur C. Norlin, a pharmacist, and Bertha Williams Norlin, a homemaker. He studied at the University of Pittsburgh under Henry Morgan and later at the University of Pennsylvania where he received a Ph.D. in 1903. At Princeton University he was a fellow of the American Philosophical Society.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Norlin was a professor of physics at Mount Lebanon College and subsequently at the University of Pittsburgh, where he served as its director until 1926. He developed the inorganic theory of acoustics in 1898. Later, he developed and applied the Parsons-Dowkin principles of linear oscillations in the theory of sound and electrical discharge. Together with Spencer F. Edwards, Norlin developed the rules of ferroelectricity with Benjamin Appleton in 1909, the applied geometrical-chemical theory of the thermodynamic properties of metals in 1915, and the rules of atomic electrodynamics in 1922. When IBM and General Electric applied these ideas in 1925, Norlin was the one to apply them. He also developed the Parsons-Dowkin principle of stabilities of metals.  
 In the United States, he was a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards from 1916 to 1926. The Norlin-Swallowstamp metric was one of the official standard units of standard deviation of 20 “° ” in elastic constants.Norlin's major research topic was the general theory of elasticity and the relation between a elastic chain ( made up of successive line segments ) and its induced mechanical stress. He worked on the microscopic control of elasticity in the internal tissues of animals by applying his Theory of Elasticity in Measurement. He also studied the mechanisms of heat transfer and the principle of change in thermodynamic conductivity.  
 On his retirement in 1951, Norlin was a professor of physics at Princeton University.

 She became interested in education in the 1950s, and became the research director of the Massachusetts Department of Education's Office of English and Literacy at the request of Governor Tom Ridge in 1956, at the time one of the most prominent high-school education reformers in America.  
 Since her appointment in 1957, Poulard has focused on the needs of the disadvantaged and underserved in schools in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. One of her most important initiatives is Charter High School, a public high school in Norwalk, Connecticut, where she organized students into groups of two to four and organized them into literate `` teams ''. Her approach to teaching, parent involvement and group participation was very controversial, and many schools in the Massachusetts area rebelled against her over the academic rigor of her initiatives.  
 In 1970, Poulard served as a Commissioner in Charge of Counseling to California Department of Education, and in 1971, she was awarded the US Public Service Medal for `` her outstanding performance of public service to the State of California ''. She served as the state's highest academic award in education for two decades.

 = Catherine LaCugna =   
Catherine Mowry LaCugna ( August 6 , 1952 – May 3 , 1997 ) was a feminist Catholic theologian and author of God For Us . LaCugna 's passion was to make the doctrine of the Trinity relevant to the everyday life of modern Christians .   
 LaCugna earned her bachelor 's degree at Seattle University , her Masters and Doctorate at Fordham University , and joined the faculty at University of Notre Dame in 1981 . There , she taught systematic theology to graduate and undergraduate students , eventually holding the Nancy Reeves Dreux Chair of Theology at the University of Notre Dame.Catherine LaCugna died at the age of 44 , of cancer , and is buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery on the Notre Dame campus .   
    
    
 == Trinitarian theology ==   
 LaCugna , a Western Theologian , sought common ground with Eastern Christians through re-examining early Christian scholars or Church Fathers . She rejected modern individualist notions of personhood and emphasised the self-communication of God .   
 Building on the work of Karl Rahner , LaCugna argued that the `` demise of the doctrine of the Trinity '' started when early church theologians had to respond to the teachings of Arius , arch-heretic of the Christian church . Arius ' doctrine required a response , and the Church Fathers ' response began the theological trek into speculation on the inner , hidden life of God , commonly referred to as the immanent Trinity . Whereas before , theologians had concentrated on the nature of God as revealed in God 's actions in history ( commonly called the economic Trinity ) .   
 According to LaCugna , the church father Augustine furthered this divide between economic and immanent Trinity with his psychological model of the Trinity , which described the inner life of God as being like a human 's memory , intellect , and will . The real culprit in this matter , though , was Thomas Aquinas , whose scholastic theology took theological speculation to a whole new level .   
 Against Rahner and Karl Barth ( in Church Dogmatics I/1 , §9 ) , LaCugna wished to retain the use of the word persons in relation to the three persons of the Trinity . Rahner 's manners of subsisting and Barth 's modes ( or ways ) of being she saw as too easily adopting the modern notion of individualistic personhood , instead of a relational and interdependent model .   
 LaCugna says that God is known ontologically only through God 's self-revelation in the economy of salvation , and that `` Theories about what God is apart from God 's self-communication in salvation history remain unverifiable and ultimately untheological . '' She says faithful Trinitarian theology must be practical and include an understanding of our own personhood in relationship with God and each other , which she calls `` Living God 's life with one another '' .LaCugna 's doctrine of the Trinity has been challenged by theologians such as Nicholas Lash and James William McClendon , Jr .   
    
    
 == Awards ==   
 Professor LaCugna received two significant teaching awards from Notre Dame University . In 1993 she received the Frank O'Malley undergraduate teaching award , and she received the Charles E. Sheedy Teaching Award in 1996 .

 = Nikolai Constantinovich Baynes =  
Nikolai Constantinovich Baynes ( Russian : Александр Боринович Пата́тинов ; 25 February 1790 – 2 January 1834 ) was a Russian and Russian-American mathematician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born on a farm in Siberia, Baynes studied at the University of Kiev and in 1804 received a doctorate under Nikolai Dmitrievich Shokalskiy. In 1805 he traveled to the United States, and soon became a member of the United States mathematics department, becoming professor of algebra and probability theory in 1815. In 1831 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the same year also joining the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was among the first to perform a rigorous mathematical proof that arbitrary infinitesimals can be represented in a formula as a set of cubics with analytic powers. His proof also influenced the definition of zero ( = − ).Baynes also started an academic correspondence with J.H. Helmholtz, who soon went on to prove that the Boltzmann equation can also be represented as a term vector on a quadratic complex. He also made contributions to universal additive algebras and group theory.  
 Baynes left the University of St. Petersburg in 1808. In 1817 he returned to the U.S. and resumed teaching at the faculty of mathematics at the newly established school in Philadelphia, but he also became the standard authority on probability theory. He died on 2 January 1834 in Philadelphia.  
   
   
 == Theory of integral equations ==  
 Baynes developed his theory of integral equations later in the 18th century, which is now more commonly known as partial differential equations or partial differential equations. By removing the algebraic assumptions from these equations ( now known as binomial integrals ), Baynes helped explain the solutions of integral equations in terms of the minimal invariants that they give. For example, a solution of an integral equation `` n '' must be the product of the adjacent equations `` m '' and `` n ''. He also proved in 1802 that a direct estimate of the square root of the number of moments of the integrator can be derived from the extent of the tangent space.  
 This proof of the fundamental principle that a solution of a particular integral equation can be developed from any number of possible solutions is sometimes referred to as `` Baynes'proof ''. As a consequence, integral equations are commonly found in probability theory.In the following chapters, the remainder of a chapter, and the bulk of the rest of the book are dedicated to examples of examples, and exposition of the principles.

William Augustus Schipp ( 1891-1967 ) is an Australian-born explorer and plant collector : collected in Northern Australia , New Guinea and Java before moving to British Honduras ( Belize ) via San Francisco . He collected in Belize from 1929 to 1935 when he returned to Australia because of failing health , living ultimately in New South Wales . His health improved in Australia where he was later employed as a landscape gardener by Norman Lindsay . In 1967 William Augustus Schipp living in retirement in a country town in New South Wales die , leaving his few possessions to the local Horticultural Society , in which he was keenly interested .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 William was born in Silverton , near Broken Hill , New South Wales to Christian and Barbara Schipp ( née McNair ) . Christian , a builder and bricklayer , had come from Germany in 1855 and followed the gold rush to Broken Hill and then Kalgoorlie , Western Australia . William was the youngest of five children . He studied botany , especially flowering tropical plants .   
 William worked in the Darwin Botanical Gardens and collected plants in New Guinea , Java and Dutch East Indies for several years prior to 1929 before moving to Belize , perhaps with the Catholic Church .   
 He came to San Francisco , California from Tjondong , Tjikandang , Java in late January 1929 . At the University of California , Berkeley he spent several days with ED Merrill . Schipp left San Francisco passing through southern United States to New Orleans where he boarded the SS Abargarez for British Honduras . On the evening of 28 January 1929 he arrived at Belize , the capital and main port of the colony . Early in February 1929 Schipp left Belize equipped with a brief outline map of the colony for the Stann Creek District directly south of Belize District where he started collecting twenty specimens of each taxon in order to fulfill requests of his subscribers .   
 A pioneer , he made the first comprehensive collection of Belize botany . His collections from British Honduras are in many herbaria . Herbarium sets distributed by William A Schipp to European and American institutions represent one of the most significant and extensive collections ever made of the coastal plain flora for the Stann Creek and Toledo Districts of southern British Honduras . He compiled the first complete flora of these districts in the form of a Catalogue entitled `` Flora of the British Honduras , Pricelist of Seeds & Herbarium Material '' . As a professional botanical explorer , his discrimination in the field yielded a total of 154 taxa new to science , including two new genera - Schippia and Schizocardia . Hardships were soon overcome by this keen and discriminative botanical explorer . Whilst the most complete collections are thought to be at the Field Museum in Chicago and the Gentle Herbarium in Belmopan , Belize .

 He was born Julius Gottheimer in Dalston , London , Middlesex , England UK , the son of David Gottheimer and Minnie Mikah Gottheimer , and brother to Solomon Gottheimer . In 1926 , he married `` Lena '' Levy ( dec. 1956 ) , raising a son and a daughter , followed later by a second marriage.Grant made a career exposing forgeries on the basis of chemical analysis of paper , ink and other characteristics of written documents . Much of his work was for British Intelligence as illustrated in the Colin Wallace Clockwork Orange investigation . Well into retirement , Grant was called in to investigate possible forgery and to give expert evidence in court . In 1984 Grant 's analysis of the Hitler Diaries confirmed within a week that it was a forgery . He was also called as a witness in the war-crimes trial of John Demjanjuk.Grant lived for many of his later years on Friday Island one of the islands in the River Thames . The lock keeper at Old Windsor Lock nearby recalled Dr Grant saying that when he went to the island , he felt it was like going a million miles away . It was like owning half of Australia , it was so secluded.In the fictionalized 'autobiography ' of a former serving officer of Her Majesty 's Intelligence Service , `` Friends '' Secret Intelligence Service MI6 , the novelist , convicted fraudster and Zionist agent , Michael John O'Hara ( aka Zeev Gideon Korwan ) , wrote `` Julius Grant to me and indeed to many law enforcement officers worldwide was arguably the world 's most respected forensic scientist in his particular area of expertise .

Gustav Adolf Feodor Wilhelm Ludwig Mie ( German : [ miː ] ; 29 September 1868 – 13 February 1957 ) was a German physicist .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Mie was born in Rostock , Mecklenburg-Schwerin , Germany in 1868 . From 1886 he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Rostock . In addition to his major subjects , he also attended lectures in chemistry , zoology , geology , mineralogy , astronomy as well as logic and metaphysics . In 1889 he continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg and received a doctorate degree in mathematics at the age of 22 .   
 In 1897 he got his Habilitation at the University of Göttingen in theoretical physics and in 1902 became extraordinary professor for theoretical physics at the University of Greifswald . In 1917 he became full professor for experimental physics at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg . In 1924 he became Professor at the University of Freiburg , where he worked up to his retirement in 1935 .   
 In Freiburg , during the Nazi dictatorship , Mie was member of the university opposition of the so-called `` Freiburger Kreis '' ( Freiburg Circles ) and one of the participants of the original `` Freiburger Konzil '' .   
 He died at Freiburg im Breisgau in 1957 .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 During his Greifswald years Mie worked on the computation of scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a homogeneous dielectric sphere , which was published in 1908 under the title of “ Contributions to the optics of turbid media , particularly of colloidal metal solutions ” in `` Annalen der Physik '' . The term Mie scattering is still related to his name . Using Maxwell 's electromagnetic theory applied to spherical gold particles Mie provided a theoretical treatment of plasmon resonance absorption of gold colloids . The sharp absorption bands depend on the particle size and explain the change in colour that occurs as the size of the colloid nanoparticles is increased from 20 to 1600 nm . He wrote further important contributions to electromagnetism and also to relativity theory . In addition he was employed on measurements units and finally developed his Mie system of units in 1910 with the basic units Volt , Ampere , Coulomb and Second ( VACS-system ) .

O . A . ( Oswald Andrew ) `` Ozzy '' Bushnell ( 11 May 1913 – 21 August 2002 ) was a microbiologist , historian , novelist , and professor at the University of Hawaiʻi .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Descended from contract laborers from Portugal and Norway and a mechanic from Italy , he was born in the working-class neighborhood of Kakaʻako . His friends and classmates in the area were Chinese , Japanese , Portuguese , Hawaiian , and `` hapa-haole '' [ part-white ] , so he grew up `` local , '' mastering Hawaiian `` pidgin '' as well as English as his novels attest . As a youngster he developed a love for the cultures of Hawai ` i as well as literature and classical music . He graduated in 1934 from the University of Hawaii , where he served as student body president . By 1937 he had earned both his MS and PhD degrees in bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin and later worked and taught ( 1937–40 ) at George Washington University Medical School in Washington D.C . He returned to Hawai ` i in 1940 working for the Department of Health on Kaua ` i and Maui before joining the U.S. Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor . Following the war he taught at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa , retiring in 1970 as emeritus professor of medical microbiology and medical history . He served as editor in chief of the journal Pacific Science from 1957 through 1967 . Married to Elizabeth Jane Krauskopf in 1943 , he had two sons , Andrew and Philip and a daughter , Mahealani .   
 Bushnell 's first novel , The Return of Lono , won the Atlantic Monthly 's fiction award in 1956 , at a time when most books about Hawaiʻi were written by outsiders . Later novels dealt with other aspects of Hawaiʻi 's history and he encouraged and inspired many other local writers to tell their own stories . Molokaʻi ( 1975 ) tells the story of leprosy patients quarantined at Kalaupapa ; Kaʻaʻawa ( 1972 ) describes life on Oʻahu in the 1850s , during the great smallpox epidemic when many native Hawaiians were dying of newly introduced diseases ; and Stone of Kannon ( 1979 ) and its sequel Water of Kane tell about the first Japanese contract laborers who arrived in 1868 . In 1974 , the Hawaiʻi Literary Arts Council presented him an Award for Literature , saying he `` brought life to fact and reality to fiction . `` His historical works include `` Hawaii : A Pictorial History '' ( 1969 ) with Joseph Feher and Edward Joesting , `` A Walk Through Old Honolulu '' ( 1975 ) , and `` A Song of Pilgrimage and Exile : The Life and Spirit of Mother Marianne of Molokai '' ( 1980 ) with Sister Mary Laurence Hanley , O.S.F .   
 His last work , Gifts of Civilization : Germs and Genocide in Hawaii ( 1993 ) , combined his interests in microbiology , Hawaiian history , and literature . It remains the definitive study of how Native Hawaiians , having lived in isolation for centuries , were very nearly wiped out by exposure to newly introduced diseases such as tuberculosis , smallpox , and leprosy .

 Von Pfeiffer was born in 1718 in Berlin and was the son of a Prussian official who administered royal property ( Domänenverwaltung ) . He was a brilliant and skillful practitioner in the new art of his day known as Cameralism ( Cameral science ) and he was to develop land as a particular theorist of the absolutist Economics policy , a requirement of the day , equally successfully . In the Prussian civil service von Pfeiffer rose to the position of privy councilor and from 1747 to 1750 von organized the settlement of small holders and the construction of 150 villages in the Frederick William I of Prussia settlement policy in the Mark Brandenburg district ( Kurmark ) . After that , he was employed in changing the small German states . He worked from 1778 to 1781 in Hanau on the improvement of agriculture and the manufacturing system .   
 He wrote numerous works on widespread subjects , such as forestry and finance , agriculture , carbonization of bituminous coal and means of improving the bliss of Germany . In 1784 he published his six-volume work Corrections famous State , financial , police , Cameral , Commerzbank ( commercial banks ) and economic writings of this century .   
 In the same year he was appointed as professor on the part of the reform of the University of Mainz as newly established specialist in Cameral science or public administration as it later become known . The course provided its students with a four-year study that included subjects such as U.S. history , natural law , applied mathematics , law , statistics , chemistry , agriculture and forestry , finance , trade and public administration . The goal was not only in the strengthening of state power through better economic performance , he wanted to join the advocacy of the principle of law and for a mutual understanding preparing international policy for the possibility of offensive wars .

Fredrik Adge ( 2 February 1917 – 21 December 2008 ) was a Danish neurologist and neuropathologist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Fredrik Adge was born in Gadsheim, Denmark to Albrecht, a teacher, and Helena Clausen ( née Andreasen ). He studied at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1933 with a bachelor's degree in biology. He then enrolled at the Royal Institute of Copenhagen, where he graduated in 1947 with a doctorate in neurology.Adge joined the Norsk Neuroscience Institute and, while there, was to work on diseases of neurogenesis, which includes Huntington's disease. After he returned to Copenhagen, he became a researcher in his field.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1956, Adge started working at the Child Neurological Institute, located in Medborg, Denmark. In 1966, he joined the editorial board of the Journal of Neurosurgery. Since the war, the editorial board of this journal was divided between psychiatrists and neurologists. The medical topic was regarded as less controversial than clinical neurosurgery. However, in 1983, the editorial board merged into the American Journal of Neurology, and the Journal of Neurosurgery was given its own journal, Journal of Neurosurgery. In addition, the New York Times reported that Richard Harms, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University, was to form the editorial board for the Journal of Neurosurgery, which was subsequently a division of the Journal of Neurosurgery. Because of the United States'presence in Europe, the neurosurgery journal was not recognized by other European journals.  
 He worked at the New York Neurological Institute from 1973 to 1976. In 1976, Adge was offered a position at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Pathology. The position was after a decade of campaigning by, and with the support of, George Church, then director of the Einstein Care Clinic, and Walter S. Oberlander, who was then the director of the Institute of Neuropathology at Massachusetts General Hospital. He completed his faculty appointment at Einstein in 1977.  
 In 1978, Adge accepted a position at Duke University Medical Center and moved there to lead the vascular endoscopy team. He was elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Neurology in 1984. He was a full professor of clinical neurology at Duke in 1988. In 1991, he moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he taught pediatrics and neurosurgery. His later publications included Neurodegenerative Diseases and Immunological Pathologies : A Systematic Review and Physiological Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disease ( 1992 ) and Neurosurgical Brain Injury and Related Disorders ( 1996 ).

 = Roger Wilkes =  
Roger Wilkes ( July 19, 1912 – January 6, 1981 ) was an American biochemist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Wilkes was born on July 19, 1912, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of John Wilkes, a professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania, and Peggy Maurice, the daughter of her first husband, T. H. Paul. Wilkes was educated at Eastman School in Philadelphia, and then at Harvard University where he was a first-year graduate student in biochemistry. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1942 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with his thesis on the activity of polysaccharides, in which he demonstrated that the enzyme he found in potato tuber extract could catalyze inactivation of starch as a by-product. Wilkes wrote his dissertation under the supervision of Ralph Halpern, a research chemist from the Materials Research Center at Harvard.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Roger Wilkes worked for the University of Pennsylvania Biological Sciences Department as a university lecturer, receiving his Ph.D. in 1946, under the direction of Richard Alum of the University of Wisconsin. He began working at the California Institute of Technology in 1948, as a post-doc in the Cavendish Laboratory, where he worked with Ralph Hammes, later to become the head of the Cavendish Laboratory, to investigate a protease reaction from mitochondria to produce F4 ( trypsin A ) and F7 ( glutathione S ). He became a senior research fellow at Columbia University in 1955, where he worked on lipid metabolism, cell membrane permeability, and the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum plasticity. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences ( 1949 ), Science Writers of America ( 1950 ), and the National Academy of Engineering ( 1956 ).In 1957, Wilkes joined the faculty at MIT as professor of biochemistry and he remained at MIT as professor of biochemistry until his retirement in 1980. He died on January 6, 1981 in his home in Boston.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 One of Wilkes'major contributions to biochemistry was his discovery of the enzyme thioglycolate dehydrogenase in 1947. This enzyme is now widely used in clinical laboratories, and is one of only two enzymes that can oxidize a small number of insoluble compounds, while the other is an enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic respiration of lipids and sugars. It is also active against rust, and Wilkes was instrumental in the creation of the George B. Tronikoff Fluid Cycling System.  
 Wilkes also is known for his development of the Wilkes–Schlakow Colorimetric Calorie Screen for Health professionals in 1961. This system can predict the life expectancy of individuals using a color change indicator. He was a co-founder of the National Academy of Sciences in 1971.Wilkes was the senior recipient of the Joseph L. Ingraham Endowed Fellowship in 1950, and the Elliott C. Watts Endowed Fellowship in 1954. He received the Charles P. Steel Foundation Prize of the Atomic Energy Research Foundation in 1955, the Frederick J. Pierce Foundation Honoris Causa Award in 1960, the Hughes School Award for Research in Protein Science, and the Armented G. Williams Bancroft Medal in 1964. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Chemists and the American Society for Cell Biology. He was an honorary member of the Chemical Research Foundation of Great Britain.  
 Wilkes is noted for his collaboration with the young Derek Fryar on enzyme action in hydrocytes, for his work in co-division with Halpern on enzyme synthesis in plants and algae, and for the Wilkes–Schlakow experiment that showed how the specific protein orientation of enzymes affects their activity. In addition to his many research contributions, he is a widely respected biochemist with over 125 research publications, and he has an extensive and valued role in scientific education and management.

 = Charles Mansfield Dixon =  
Charles Mansfield Dixon ( April 21, 1915 – May 31, 1986 ) was an American botanist and native plant collector. He is best known for his studies of ferns and mosses. He also studied fungi, contributing to the field of botany there by setting up the Charles Monckton Vignettes from the University of Minnesota.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Chico, California, he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1942, publishing the first of two papers on mosses.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Dixon's career with the University of Minnesota was stimulated by Charles Rowland, the administrative director of the Botanical Garden and his nephew. He moved to the University of Minnesota in 1947, and then to the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1953, where he served as the first director of the college's Division of Tropical Flora, from 1952 until his retirement in 1976. The laboratory in Wisconsin–Madison was named `` Charles T. Dixon Botanical Lab ''.In 1951, Dixon set up the Charles Monckton Vignettes, a series of six large prints of fungi. From 1953 to 1959, he worked with UCLA lecturer Joseph Weinschenk and led the world-famous florescence survey of some 7,700 species of plants ( together with a U.S. survey team that was at its peak when it joined forces with the Soviet botanist Pyotr Gelfand in 1960 ). A research project together with Guy Antoine, the noted French botanist, was founded to do similar works in South America, but Dixon was on the faculty when the project commenced. These investigations enabled him to show the relative structure of the monotypic and the polytypic species. He was a member of a number of other successful botanical surveys, including those in Colombia and Ecuador.  
 He served as curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology and Ecology at the American Museum of Natural History, and a member of the Rockefeller Foundation ( 1970–1975 ). In 1979, the Charles Monckton Plants Project began to produce the Charles Monckton Atlas, a reference book on North American flora. In 1986, he was the recipient of the Carpenter And Oppenheimer Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  
 The Field Foundation established an annual Charles Monckton fund for public discussion of South American and Peruvian flora, which is now maintained by the Flora of the Field Foundation.  
 He died on May 31, 1986, and is buried in the Eastern Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

 Wiedberg attended the gymnasium in Krefeld, where his father was a professor. He learned anatomy and physiology from his father. While in Krefeld, Wiedberg took courses at the `` Gymnasium des Hauses '' in his father's lab and at the `` Gymnasium des Wagens '' in his grandfather's lab. Thereafter, his interest in animals, especially insects, came to him from the German Academy of Sciences and Arts.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After receiving his medical degree from the Krefeld Academy, Wiedberg worked for six years as an assistant in an anatomy laboratory in Prague, Czechoslovakia. While living in Prague, he discovered the chia plant, the edible root part of the nightshade ( Aspergillus ), and first reported on the ability of chia to aid digestion. He came to believe that it was an important nutritional source of the human body, and he further coined the word `` chia '' to describe it. After returning to Krefeld in 1775, he became an assistant to his father and brother in agriculture. While at his father's farm, he performed some anatomical experiments on small plants, including :  
   
 The discovery of the chia plant and of its edible root, Aspergillus, an insect-growing, plant-like root of the genus Candidatus.  
 The discovery of alpha-cyclodextrin.  
 The discovery of Beta-cyclodextrin and the pharmaceutical uses of it.  
 The discovery and identification of the gall network and polyethylene glycol ( polyethylene = `` like glue '' ).Wiedberg later became an associate professor at the University of Neuchâtel, where he served as the professor of pathology. In 1787 he became a professor at the University of Greifswald, another city in the region of Alsace. In 1799 he was named director of the University of Greifswald veterinary institute. In 1790 he became director of the Malmö Institute of the University of Stockholm. In 1800 he became a professor at the newly founded Stiftung für Phytopathie und Verteilung ( Stiftung of Nature and Plants ).After a brief time in Paris, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( Zoologischer Forschungsinstitut ) in 1803. In 1813 he was named chair of zoology at the University of Greifswald, where he remained until his death in 1818. In his lifetime he published about two hundred scientific papers on some 220 species.

 He was hired by Indiana University in 1946 , where he spent two years under pioneering behaviorist B. F. Skinner . While other child psychologists had focused on use of techniques such as play therapy to identify the motives and causes of problematic behavior , Bijou used Skinner 's behavioral techniques to encourage positive behaviors through such rewards as praise , hugs and pieces of candy . Children who were defiant would be given a time-out and separated from a group activity , with the expectation that the bad behavior would be its own punishment , and that any additional sanctions would not have a positive effect . A child isolated from a group would strive to behave appropriately in order to have the opportunity to rejoin the group.He relocated to the University of Washington in 1948 , where he applied Skinner 's techniques on children at the Institute of Child Development , and wrote several textbooks in the field together with Donald Baer . Studies he performed there showed that encouragement of good behavior would elicit more good behavior even from unruly children . Ole Ivar Lovaas of the University of California , Los Angeles , one of the developers of applied behavior analysis therapy for autism , adapted Bijou 's techniques to develop one of the most commonly used techniques of using rewards to enhance social skills of autistic children.In 1968 , together with Donald Baer , Todd Risley , James Sherman , and Montrose Wolf , he established the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis , as a peer-reviewed journal publishing research about experimental analysis of behavior and its practical applications . [ 5 ]   
 He relocated over the years to the University of Illinois , the University of Arizona ( from 1975 to 1993 ) and the University of Nevada , Reno ( from 1993 to 2001 ) , where he established similar behavioral programs . His

He was survived by Jude and a son . His wife died in 2000 ; they had been married for 67 years.His son recalled taking the family car for a joyride when he was 15 years old and being arrested by the police . At the police station , the officers offered several ideas for punishments for the misdeed , but Dr. Bijou rejected them all , stating that `` he 's already had punishment enough '' . His son recalled the incident , stating that `` sometimes it can pay off to have a psychologist for a father '' .

 = Carl Attilius =  
Carl Friedrich Hans Breiber von Breiber von Breiber ( 16 April 1722 – 21 January 1807 ) was an Austrian composer, pianist and historian.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 He was born at Borgo Moravell, near Leopoldstadt, and studied music and at the Conservatory in Vienna under Alexander Steiner. Breiber became close friends with the young Heinrich Spengler. Both were offered positions at the Vienna Academy of Music, and Breiber studied under Spengler at the same time as Henrik Ibsen.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He began composing in 1740, and held the position of composer from 1750 until 1759, his last five years as soloist at the Grand Concerts of Vienna. Breiber was one of the first composers to abandon the use of liturgical music in his music. Breiber composed some popular music, but mostly works that were expurgated by the Nazis after the end of the Third Reich.  
 He published only one orchestral work, a light symphonic poem entitled Natg. iennennus, in 1760. Later, he composed a few cello concertos and small instrumental works. He also wrote a collection of poems, which were published as Letters to Mr. Julius Kober.In 1765, he composed the longest sonata, and the first chamber music in German language, the sonata for cello and piano. Breiber died in Vienna in 1807.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Breiber composed some pieces and choral works. Although his own compositions are often bitter critical, the overt and incidental orchestration in his symphonies, sonatas, and suites ( on which he was praised for their complex harmonics ) are still rather influential ; the way his music is carried with a high sense of humour makes it easy for listeners to follow.  
 Breiber's best known composition is probably The Roman Cadenza ( 1811 ), which bears his name. It is a complex 7-movement choral with choral melodies written in modal meter, and opuses of a dramatic mood.He was also a student of Johann Sebastian Bach, and was fascinated by his chamber music.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 The Breiber family were of noble-born descent. Carl Breiber was the eldest son. One of his brothers, Frederick Wirbel, was also a composer. Their parents were Bernd Leopold Breiber ( 1726-1776 ), a minister ; his father was a canon of the Benedictine cathedral in Vienna, and his mother was a tailor. A nephew, Carl Anthony Breiber ( 1730-1796 ), a piano pedagogue, and other relatives survived him.

Susan Frances Dorf ( June 6, 1926 - June 11, 2008 ) was an American computer scientist, educator, and teacher. Dorf was a researcher in the mathematical fields of statistics, probability, and infinite Monte Carlo simulations. She is considered one of the pioneers of mathematical statistics and of probability.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Susan Frances Dorf was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Albert and Frances Hebb Dorf, who raised three children. Her family had a brick mill in her home town. She entered elementary school in 1942, a year after graduating from high school. She was quickly recognized as an intelligent student, and earned her bachelor's degree from Michigan State College in 1945. She was a senior in her class at Michigan State College, and had just started her career. She went on to earn her master's degree in 1948, and her doctorate in 1951. She also attended graduate school in mathematics at MIT.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 When Dortch took her graduate course in mathematics in 1948, she showed a strong talent for solving problems. Her earliest problems were in probability theory. These courses helped prepare her for her undergraduate position at the University of Michigan, where she also had a part-time job teaching mathematics. She later took a job at the University of Michigan, where she developed a relationship with Mathias Niebuhr, who had also studied at MIT. In 1949, Dortch earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from Michigan State. Later, she would earn her Diploma in mathematics and director of the Mathematical Research Laboratory at Michigan State. During the next decade, Dortch became a faculty member at the University of Michigan. She became a professor in 1949 and became a full professor in 1952, four years after graduating. From 1952 to 1952, she also worked as a research mathematician at the John von Neumann Institute. Dortch's position there allowed her to concentrate on mathematical research and has led some to suggest that she took the institute for granted. In 1954, Dortch moved to the University of Minnesota, where she developed a relationship with Robert Jensen, who had also been hired at Michigan State. She then worked at the University of California, Berkeley from 1956 to 1958, taking a faculty position that same year. She remained at Berkeley, moving to the Institute of Mathematics in 1960, joining again at UC Berkeley in 1965.In 1968, Dortch became Professor of Mathematics and director of the Computer Program Laboratories at Virginia Tech, an associate professorship at New York University in 1972. She remained there until 1991. From 1992 to 1996, she worked as Dean of the School of Mathematics and Technology at the University of Michigan, specializing in applied mathematics.

 = Henry Edington (entomologist) =  
Henry Edington ( 5 January 1816, in Vienna – 3 March 1876, in Bombay ) was a British entomologist and naturalist.  
 Edington's father was David Heddle Edington, a merchant in the first stage of transportation.  
 His mother was Sarah Isabel Thistlewood, an actress, but she did not become the wife of Henry Edington. He was the fourth child of his elder brother Samuel and his wife Catherine ( née Williams ).  
 Edington married William Francis Evans on 23 August 1828, at St Thomas'Church, Holborn, London. He gave £400 in his first year. He then made part-time records from Holborn till his death.Edington studied entomology under Thomas Dyer at St Johns College, Oxford, and later in London with Charles Darwin. Edington is credited with being the first to describe 18th-century spherosporia. The species was named in his honour in 1889 by Ernest Watson & William Bird.  
 A practical insect dealer in the 1860s, Edington made an attempt in 1867 to acquire the specimens that were in the entomological collection of the St Louis Museum of Natural History ( now the Florida Museum of Natural History ) in Chicago. However, the exhibits were then destroyed in the 1898 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  
 Edington died in Bombay.

 He used his wealth to sponsor various natural history expeditions and in 1906 he sent Wilmot W. Brown to Guadalupe Island off Pacific Mexico . Here , Brown , H. W. Marsden and Ignacio Oroso gathered field data on how the natural vegetation was being destroyed by thousands of goats , to the detriment of the native wildlife . The native Guadalupe storm petrel was being predated by introduced cats , as was the Guadalupe flicker . Both birds became extinct shortly afterwards ; several other taxa were found to be already gone in 1906 . Thayer and Outram Bangs wrote an article in The Condor to draw attention to the situation.In 1913 Thayer and other Harvard graduates sponsored an expedition to Alaska and Siberia , with Joseph S. Dixon and Winthrop Sprague Brooks as zoological collectors . A gull collected by Brooks on this trip was named Larus thayeri in Thayer 's honour .   
 Thayer became ill in 1928 , and donated his collection of 28,000 skins and 15,000 eggs and nests to Harvard . These included the first clutches ever collected of spoon-billed sandpiper and surfbird . After Thayer 's death Harvard received his collection of 3,500 mounted birds .

Joseph Bertrand, also nicknamed Lilley, was an English entomologist.  
 Born in Port Elizabeth, Dorset, he was the son of Reverend Thomas Bertrand, a Fellow of Christ Church and of St Paul's Cathedral. He studied ornithology and botany at Cambridge University, where he was elected a Fellow in 1878. In 1880 he was appointed director of the Entomological and Zoological Observatory of King's College, Cambridge, taking over from John Law ( 1833–1905 ).During the 1860s and 1870s Bertrand developed a keen interest in the songbirds of the West Indies, and collected extensively from Madagascar. He was an officer of the Linnean Society and was active as the curator of the British Museum's South American garden, although he never managed to see all of the specimens collected. In his time as museum director he produced works by alpine insect species including the genus Glaucidae. Bertrand was one of the two signatories of the article `` The Theory of Heterogenesis '', in Darwin's theory of evolution, which is now known to be false. In his role as zoologist Bertrand assisted Charles Darwin in the preparation of the third edition of the Natural History of Borneo, and in 1865 contributed to the final edition of Herbert Spencer's Natural History of Egypt, which was also produced at Cambridge.  
 He was a member of the Royal Society of London from 1875 to 1879, and was the father of the Australian entomologist, James Bertrand.

 Audebert was born at Rochefort . He studied painting and drawing at Paris , and gained reputation as a miniature-painter . Employed in preparing plates for the Histoire des cloportes of Guillaume-Antoine Olivier , he acquired a taste for natural history . His first original work , Histoire naturelle des singes appeared in 1800 , illustrated by sixty-two folio plates , drawn and engraved by himself . The coloring in these plates was unusually beautiful , and was applied by a method devised by himself . His work was also included in the bestselling Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse.Audebert died in Paris , leaving complete materials for another work , Histoire des colibris , oiseaux-mouches , jacamars et promerops , which was published in 1802 . Two hundred copies were printed in folio , one hundred in large quarto , and fifteen were printed with the whole text in letters of gold . Another work , left unfinished , was also published after the author 's death , L'Histoire des grimpereaux et des oiseaux de paradis . The last two works also appeared together in two volumes , Oiseaux dorés , ou à reflets métalliques ( 1801-1802 ) , written with his friend Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot . In this work he printed lines of gold and silver over the painted colours of the birds to give them a metallic sheen imitating the iridescent colours of nature .

 = Fran C3 A7ois Valentijn =   
François Valentijn ( 17 April 1666 – 6 August 1727 ) was a Dutch minister , naturalist and author whose Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indiën ( `` Old and New East-India '' ) describes the history of the Dutch East India Company and the countries of the Far East .   
 François Valentijn was born in 1666 in Dordrecht , Holland , where he lived most his life ; however , he is known for his activities in the tropics , notably in Ambon , in the Maluku Archipelago . Valentijn read theology and philosophy at the University of Leiden and the University of Utrecht before leaving for a career as a preacher in the Indies .   
 In total , Valentijn lived in the East Indies 16 years . Valentijn was first employed by the V.O.C . ( Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie ) at the age of 19 as minister to the East Indies , where he became a friend of the German naturalist Georg Eberhard Rumpf ( Rumphius ) . He returned and lived in Holland for about ten years before returning to the Indies in 1705 where he was to serve as army chaplain on an expedition in eastern Java . He finally returned to Dordrecht where he found time to write his Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indiën ( 1724–26 ) a massive work of five parts published in eight volumes and containing over one thousand engraved illustrations and some of the most accurate maps of the Indies of the time . He died in The Hague , Netherlands , in 1727 .   
 Valentijn probably had access to the V.O.C . 's archive of maps and geographic trade secrets , which they had always guarded jealously . Johannes van Keulen II ( d. 1755 ) became Hydrographer to the V.O.C . at the time Valentijn 's Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indiën was published . It was in the younger van Keulen 's time that many of the VOC charts were first published , one signal of the decline of Dutch dominance in the spice trade . One uncommon grace afforded Valentijn was that he lived to see his work published ; the VOC ( Dutch East India Company ) strictly enforced a policy prohibiting former employees from publishing anything about the region or their colonial administration . And while , as Thomas Suárez notes , by the mid-18th century the Dutch no longer feared sharing geographic secrets , E. M. Beekman notes how `` the execution of this policy was erratic and based on personal motives '' .While Valentijn 's maps and diagrams were prized possessions , his scholarship , judging by 21st-century standards was unscrupulous . Valentijn 's use of the products of other scientists ' and writers ' intellectual labour , passing it off as his own , reveals a penchant for self-aggrandisement . Beekman nevertheless cites him as an important figure and , given his writing style , diction and aptitude for narrative , one of the greatest Dutch prose writers of the time .

 = Herbert Lehman =  
Herbert Lehman ( 1885-1953 ) was an American physics professor and experimental physicist who worked in Canada during World War II. He was the son of the eminent physiologist and chemist O. F. Lehman.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Herbert Lehman's father was assistant head of the physics department of the New York Theological Seminary and a highly respected graduate of the New York Theological Seminary. Herbert Lehman was educated at New York University, the Atonement Institute and the Curtis Institute of Technology. He earned a master's degree in industrial chemistry at the University of Illinois, graduating in 1926, and a PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1930. While at Harvard, Lehman and his wife Louise donated their home in Enmore to the Harvard Alumni Association, which later became the Harvard College Seawall. In 1931, Lehman published a book entitled The New Sciences and Other Essays, in which he wrote that these new fields were misunderstood. He later wrote in a newspaper column `` the boys are rapping on the football field '' and that he `` regretted the national press corps had fallen victim to this sectarianism ''. On November 9, 1942, the U.S.N.R.C. petitioned to have a new atomic bomb declared.In 1949, Lehman joined the newly formed United States Atomic Energy Commission ( U.S.A.E.C. ). In 1950, he was appointed assistant director of the Laboratory of Nuclear Plasma and Radiation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ). He served as a senior scientist of the N.U.P.S., an X-ray and nuclear physics laboratory under the leadership of Walter Bollard.After the end of World War II, he taught in the United States Naval Academy and the Texas A & M University. During his career, he is best known for his contributions to the development of the so-called `` huge '' argon as a neutron moderator. This device, one of two accepted for use in neutron detection, contained enriched uranium bismuth for the moderator and consisted of a transuranium material ; they were used in nuclear weapons developed by the University of Michigan in Chicago. His larger work, The Isotope Research in the Composition of a Timed Vacuum, provided a comprehensive quantitative description of the order of element co-transposition in fission products in uranium-239, the fourth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust. His work also made available information that had eluded existing atomic bomb testing, such as the spatial distribution of cyclotron energies and the isotope compositions of the Uranium 235 and Uranium 235-240 isotopes.In 1951, he received the Stendhal Medal from the American Physical Society. In 1959, he received the Logan Medal. He died at his home in Aberdeen, Maryland, aged 75, on June 23, 1953.In 1934, Lehman received the Helen E. A. Scott Prize of the New York Academy of Sciences.The Sheldon M. Lehman Award was established in 1997 to recognize outstanding contributions to the physical sciences.

 = Konstantin Alexandrovich Belousov =  
Konstantin Alexandrovich Belousov ( Russian : Никола́й Се́ра́вич Ма́йсов ; October 11, 1881 in Grigorije – October 8, 1965 in Moscow ) was a Russian psychoanalyst, a famous expert in the field of sexual repression.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Belousov began his psychoanalytic studies at the University of Moscow where in 1908, with Konstantin Illisov, he became a professor of Psychoanalysis. He became in 1911 his chief assistant. Belousov married Margarita Milyuva in 1914, the couple having two daughters. His great love, though, was his wife, his own mother-in-law whose opinion greatly influenced the way he carried out his own work. A sympathetic Catholic, his life was marked with trouble as he was forced by his mother-in-law to escape to Tiflis and from there to Novorossiysk to avoid persecution by the Bolsheviks. Belousov again went to Moscow to continue his psychoanalytic studies with Charles Eustachius and subsequently supervised A. V. Kobyshev in Tiflis.  
 In Tiflis Belousov came into contact with other prominent psychoanalytic figures in these first years of the 20th century ; Lina Shukhevna and Anatole Brodsky took on his lectures, while Alexander Trubetsky in Grigorii and Shlomi Mirsky in Novorossiysk followed suit. However, Belousov would recall from his own experiences that the reaction of the opposite sex toward the personal man he viewed as oppressive was in contrast to what he perceived in the antisocial men.  
 The focus of Belousov's book Sexuality and Womanhood was not more than a reproach against an exclusive idea of sexual repression. Under its influence, he also studied the psychology of denial, in which the ability to respond to pain is also considered one of the essential elements in healthy sexuality. Belousov insisted that, while the response to painful experiences is certainly crucial to the development of the personality, the psychological response to the power of the opposite sex seems to be independent of it. Moreover, Belousov believed that the superiority of the individuals is due not to any inherent human defect but to the power exercised by the opposite sex in maintaining physical and mental inappropriateness, the replacement of erotic love with maternal affection, and by a reduction of the degree of privation at which man's power is exercised by nature or the culture of the people.  
 The book of Homosexuality for the Diagnostic of Homosexuality in the 21st Century was written after Belousov's death.

 Burney was born at Rockcastle, Texas, in 1859, to a Methodist family. He attended the University of Texas and graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1870. In 1875 he joined the University of Chicago as an instructor in neurology, and taught for 30 years. In 1879 he became a professor of neurology at Columbia University. He was also a lecturer in anatomy and pathology at Trinity College and a professor of neurological surgery at Yale. From 1899 until his death he was dean of the medical faculty of Whitman College in Aurora, Colorado. He married Annie Amelia Sauer, with whom he had three children.  
 Burney was considered one of the most highly regarded surgeons in the United States. He wrote about `` the probable pathogenesis of spinal lumbar hypoplasia, stroke and spinal muscular atrophy. '' He also developed systems for diagnosing neurasthenia. Burney contributed to classification and typographical issues of the Braille edition of his famous textbook, Neurology. He also created an instrument called the Ventilatory Stimulation Pump, which used cylinders of fluid to direct the end of a cadaver's blood pressure, according to Dr. Burney's theory, to the muscles that the cadaver moved.  
 He served as president of the American Academy of Neurology from 1916 to 1920. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, and is interred in Forest Hill Cemetery in Greenwood, New Hampshire.

Eugenio de Filippi ( 1864–1920 ) was an Italian-born, first-born son of Mollino Filippi. He was educated at the University of Padua, where he was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Caniglia. He was admitted a member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences in 1870, and was soon going to head a Italian establishment in the U.S. There he found himself invited to a partnership with his friend Italian neurophysiologist Adalbert Mayr. They opened the first neuropsychological laboratory at the Fortino Hospital in Philadelphia, which they described as `` the first of its kind in the world ''. In his later years, he was professor of physiological chemistry at the University of Florence and professor at the University of Milan.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 He founded the first institute in the U.S. for neurophysiology and psychopharmacology, and collaborated with Mayr and other pioneers in this field, becoming co-founder of the newly established National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) in 1914. His papers about brain activity and neurophysiology were recognized as classics by both. He is also credited with determining the ratio of beta to gamma AMPK. De Filippi's work provided an interpretation of the hippocampus's effect on learning and memory, based on his interpretation of recent findings. He also explored the early stages of learning and focused on human behaviour. His later work also studies the effects of training and esthetics on the hippocampus, specifically on the emotional functions of the hippocampus.De Filippi's work, and his dedication to research, were accompanied by a high moral sense and a fierce but gentle personality. In his later years he showed an interest in natural history. De Filippi dedicated his book, The Art of Mental Health ( 1922 ), to Henry Seligman, who greatly influenced his research.De Filippi died in 1920, aged 58.

Bernhard Wilfrid ( 28 August 1870 – 23 September 1943 ) was a Dutch phycologist. He was a member of the German Urological Society.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Wilfrid was born in Beppel, now part of the Provence. He studied medicine in his native town and studied medicine at the University of Leiden. In 1904, he worked in bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute, and in 1908 he became a full professor of bacteriology at the University of Amsterdam. In the 1890s he was involved in `` World War I '' research, but his wartime responsibilities necessitated his transfer to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, where he worked on infectious diseases and on natural processes. Wilfrid was a personal friend of Edward Jenner. In 1907, he was made a Knight of the Order of the British Empire.  
 In 1928, Wilfrid became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences ( KNA ), and for the next 27 years he served as the KNA's director. At that time he was one of the main advocates of a Mycology with a Very Life attitude. After the war, Wilfrid was in total denial about his wartime activities.  
 In the last years of his life, Wilfrid spent a considerable amount of time in intensive rehabilitation work, and his health greatly deteriorated. After he died in Amsterdam, the Albert Amphibia Foundation ( AWF ) conferred upon him the Order of Merit.Wilfrid did not greatly influence the developments of mycology, and his only contributions appear to have been his attitude to theories such as `` Helicobacter pylori - through the meat of Montelius '', and his frequent reference to pathogenic bacteria.

 He was one of the first to extend the fossil record of living marine organisms to those deep in the ocean, especially in the very deep areas of the Antarctic, where extensive cavities can provide abundant opportunity for fossil animals to show off their special characteristics. His search for new specimens of marine insects and other living materials which might possibly have been speciated by dinosaurs also led to the discovery of many new species of dinosaurs, such as Iguanodon.

He became a fieldwork volunteer for the Dutch International Research Foundation ( KUVO ), KUVOZ, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences ( KNAAS ), and was the first naturalist to gather spider data in south-eastern Brazil.  
   
   
 == Education and career ==  
 Jaap Franck, a chemist at the University of Amsterdam and KUVO, received his Ph.D. in 1907 in the field of the structure of organic compounds, i.e., on the basis of the Old Swedish experiment of Carl Egil Ullmann. After work as an investigator of the Swedish plant chemistry institute, he decided to work in South America, where he served in the plantation, horticulture and forestry departments of universities. After working in Bolivia, Guatemala, and Paraguay, he returned to South America, where he worked as an entomologist at the University of São Paulo in 1930. After this he was appointed to a position as a fieldwork volunteer for the Field Service of the Dutch International Research Foundation ( KUVO ), KUVOZ. In 1933, when the foundation was created he was appointed as its first research worker in Rio de Janeiro. While working there, he participated in the establishment of the natural history museum of Rio. In 1943, he was appointed a director of KUVO, and participated in a number of scientific expeditions in Brazil. In 1952, he became the first member of the research staff at the department of zoology at the National Museum of the Paraná Natural History and the Museu Geral de Bebidade ( Museums in Brazilian Africa ).In 1959, he became the first member of the University and Department of Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture ( UNATA ) as an entomologist. In 1966 he became the head of the Department of Migratory Animal Ecology and Paleontology at the Royal University of Leiden, also acting as the director of the conservation center and garden of the herbarium. In 1979, the Open Academy, the public institution for biology and ecological studies in Leiden, was named in his honor.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 Jaap Franck is the author of nearly 400 papers and several monographs. He was the first to work on spider venoms using the formaldehyde extraction method. With the help of Miguel Angelina Martins, he investigated the zoological activity of the European Calliphora species. His research on the fauna of Colombia, served as a basis for the establishment of the zone of life of the state of Oaxaca. Among his earlier studies on spiders, he showed that the genera Calliphora fam., Calliphora monographum, Calliphora subunni, and Calliphora urefractalis are considered to be of genus Pellythia, of which he named copteraria.  
 Jaap Franck was the first to gather spider data in south-eastern Brazil. The location of this place was collected from 1928 to 1934 during expeditions in the Patagonian Lowlands. He made his spider collection the focus of fieldwork projects of the KUVO, for the last five years of the 1970s. Besides collecting the field samples and a detailed description of the spiders, he also collected specimens of birds and animals.

Max Janko ( January 22, 1921 – November 17, 2008 ) was a Swedish-born, Czechoslovakian, Czechoslovakian biologist and psychophysiologist known as an authority on histology. He was one of the earliest scientists to study the effects of testosterone on sperm motility.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Janko was born in Rosengård ( then part of the Austrian Empire ). He received his doctorate at Lund University in 1935, specializing in physiology. He returned to Lund in 1945, as an assistant professor of experimental physiology and head of the biology department. In 1948 he was appointed to the psychology faculty at Lund University. From 1948 to 1955 he served as director of the department of biological sciences.  
 Janko's interest in hormones led him to a book, The Gnostic Serum, written in 1954, the year after he had his doctoral thesis. His work on brain functioning led him to start an ongoing collaboration with Prof. Axel Stoelschmidt, the Head of the Department of Experimental Medicine, and his younger brother, Hans. A second edition was published in 1991. During this period Janko developed `` electrochemical optogenetics '' into a whole field in neurology and psychology. This research has been extensively cited in books such as Hans's Neuroelectrodynamics and Isaac Asimov's Science in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.  
 Janko was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973, jointly with Arnold Schwartz, for his discovery of the action potential of dopamine on the respiratory cycle. It was not until 1975 that Janko published his first paper on the physiology of sex hormones in the Journal of Physiology and was rewarded with the Herbert Plaster Award.  
 In 1975, Janko published his seminal paper with Sc.D. Anders Fjordman that published the volume `` Clinical and Translational Studies of Testosterone : Its Relations to Sex Development, Moods, and Personality ''. The paper would contribute to the field of comparative psychology and would lead to his appointment as an associate professor at the University of Stockholm in 1986. In 1996, Janko founded and served as the founding chair of the Faculty of Psychology and was succeeded as Professor by Niels Henriksen who had taken up the post in 1988.  
 In the United States, Janko ’ s book `` Testosterone and Brain Development '' was used by the United States National Institutes of Health in a landmark 1982 paper.  
   
   
 == Personal life and accomplishments ==  
 Janko married Barbara in 1939. The couple had one son, August Janko. Max Janko died in August 2008 from lung cancer at the age of 81.

 = Caleb Evans =   
Caleb Evans ( 25 July 1831 – 16 September 1886 ) , was an English geologist .   
 Evans , born on 25 July 1831 , was educated under Professor Key at University College School . The death of his father compelled him to leave school at an early age , and in 1846 he began work in a solicitor 's office . In 1852 Evans was appointed a clerk in the chancery pay office , a post he held until 1882 , when his health enforced his retirement . He never married ; his residence was at Hampstead , where he lived with his brother and sisters . Evans commenced the study of geology by attending lectures delivered in 1855 by Professor Owen and Dr. Melville . In 1858 he began to collect fossils from the tertiary formations of the south of England , and formed during the next twenty-five years very complete sets illustrating the strata of the London district . He also investigated the strata of the Isle of Wight , Lyme Regis , Weymouth , Swanage , and Portsmouth .   
 In 1857 Evans took part in founding the Geologists ' Association of London , of which he was for many years one of the most active members , and in 1867 he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society . He was fortunate in being able to take advantage of the operations in connection with the main drainage works in the south of London , which afforded opportunities for collecting fossils never likely to recur . He secured suites of specimens of fossil shells of great interest and rarity . Evans also did excellent work in studying the chalk . He made large collections of its fossils , and his paper ‘ On some Sections of Chalk between Croydon and Oxted , ’ read to the Geologists ' Association in January 1870 , marks the first English attempt to divide this immensely thick mass of pure white limestone into several zones , and to correlate these zones with those that continental geologists had already established .   
 Altogether Evans was the author of eleven papers on geological subjects , eight of which appeared in the ‘ Proceedings ’ of the Geologists ' Association , including the paper on the chalk mentioned above , along with `` Geology of the neighbourhood of Portsmouth and Ryde '' . His other work included sketch of the geology of Faringdon in the ‘ Geologist ’ for August 1866 , and ‘ Mill Hill in former Ages , ’ written for the Mill Hill Magazine . Many of Evans 's papers were also published separately .   
 Evans constructed several geological models or relief maps , his method being to paste layer upon layer of cartridge paper so as to secure the necessary elevations , and then to colour the whole according to the outcrop of the rocks . His models of the valley of the Thames near London , of a part of the same on a larger scale , and one of the whole of England , were passed to H. J. Lister of Eldon Road , Hampstead after Evans ' death ; a map or model of the country round Hastings is in the possession of the corporation of that town ; he also constructed a model of the neighbourhood of Sidmouth . Evans 's extensive collections of fossils were purchased by Mr. Ernest Westlake of Fordingbridge .   
 Evans died on 16 September 1886 .

He defended John Milton against William Lauder 's charge of plagiarism ( 1750 ) , and attacked David Hume 's rationalism in his Letter on the Criterion of Miracles ( 1754 ) ; he went on to criticise the followers of John Hutchinson in his Apology for the Clergy ( 1755 ) . He also edited Captain Cook 's Journals , and Clarendon 's Diary and Letters ( 1763 ) .

 However , he never took up this post , but instead accepted the chair in Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds , which he held until 1986 .   
 He then returned to Cambridge as Professor of Applied Mathematics in succession to George Batchelor .   
 Later he became a well-loved Master of Jesus College ( 1997–2000 ) , and was head of the Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics department ( DAMTP ) , where Stephen Hawking worked , in Cambridge between 1991 and 2000 , where he was held in huge regard by the faculty and students .   
 Away from his mathematical work , Crighton was a devotee of the music of Richard Wagner , as well as music for the piano .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Crighton 's scientific interests were primarily in the theory of waves and aeroacoustics , as well as in some areas of fluid mechanics . He published over 120 papers and one book.In his first paper , Crighton studied the sound wave associated with turbulent flow over a discontinuous surface formed by two semi-infinite flexible planes . Over the years he worked broadly in the fields of acoustics , equation theory and quasi-diabatic systems including solitons . This included works on the generalised Burgers ' equation and inverse scattering theory .   
 The distinction of his work was recognised by the award of the Rayleigh Medal of the Institute of Acoustics , the Per Bruel Gold Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Otto Laporte Award of the American Physical Society .

 = Edward Smith =  
Sir Edward Smith ( 11 December 1807 – 13 December 1869 ) was a British physicist, best known for developing mathematical models to compute the quantity of mass for space and the electromagnetic properties of matter.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Smith was born in Norwich and educated at the Royal School of Mines. In 1836 he qualified as a surveyor, with the rest of his family moving to Greenwich. He joined the Royal Society of London in 1845, where he became the youngest member and then the oldest continuously serving.In 1845 he was the first member of the Cambridge laboratory, where he was appointed director of experimental mathematics in 1845. This led to a promotion to full professor in 1853. Smith's contribution to mathematics was a seminal insight into relativity and the Higgs model. In 1852 he discovered the Peano factor, which has now been published by researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory.  
 Smith was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1856. His proposers were Robert Millikan, Thomas Young, Robert Strachey and John Theobald Whittaker.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 In 1832 Smith married Alice Ann Wedgwood, the youngest daughter of George Ann Wedgwood, a minister in Norwich. They had four children : Lewis, Edward, Harriet and Jane. Edward Smith was a chemist and on his death in 1865 the medical library of The Institution of Medical Engineers was renamed after Edward Smith. Smith's other son, Sir Francis Smith, was also a scientist in the Civil Service.

 = Frederik R C3 BCnheim =  
Frederik Georg Rénheim ( 12 June 1861 – 24 February 1937 ) was a Danish mathematics teacher and physicist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Copenhagen in 1861, Rénheim was the son of a teacher and the uncle of mathematician and physicist Frederik Rénheim ( 1809–1898 ). Rénheim studied chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, from which he graduated in 1882 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked as a chemist in the munitions factory of Chemikbladet until 1885, when he became a physics teacher. During his earlier years he also worked as a glass-blower. In the beginning of the 1890s he published two papers, on dyes and melting points, on melting-points of iron and glass and on thermal constants. The second paper was received mainly with considerable praise.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1896 Rénheim was hired by the University of Copenhagen as a laboratory teacher and theoretical physicist. In 1908 he was promoted to the position of professor. Rénheim was also the organiser of the Intercalation-ringing-concert which occurred from May 1896 to May 1903 in Copenhagen. The conference was attended by a multitude of luminaries and distinguished personalities, including later Nobel Prize winner August Schleyer, the writer Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and e.g. Ludwig Boltzmann, who had worked with Rénheim in the same laboratory. Rénheim was the director of the institute which became the International Institute for Polar-Temporal Experimental Research.  
 He became a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences in 1922, the Royal Danish Academy of Engineering in 1925, and the Danish Academy of Sciences in 1932.In 1897 he discovered the René I. Schneider krigesling ( René I. Schneider–Schurmeyer effect ) that allows to distinguish a particular type of fluid from any other type in a liquid state. The value is 0.53 m2/s2. In 1927 he published a new differential equation on dyads, which still survives. It is a function of the dispersion coefficient, known as the René I. Schneider krigesling function. It explains a phenomenon occurring in anodes, cathodes and perforations. The most important limitation of this variable is that it is effectively a differential equation that depends only on the dispersion coefficients. Other types of liquids require a formula that can be derived from the René I. Schneider krigesling function. This is the formula of the René I. Schneider particle density function.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The René I. Schneider krigesling and René I. Schneider–Schurmeyer-effect are widely used in glaciology.The National Museum of Denmark holds René I. Schneider's laboratory equipment as well as physics instruments in its archives.

Ellen ( E ) Sebag Ostersund ( 27 April 1903 – 26 November 1977 ) was a Norwegian Norwegian violinist and music educator. She was a member of the Orchestre Kristianii till Tresangamu, and the orchestra of Tresangamu Central District. She was the first person in Norway to play the violin in a concert without a concertina.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Ellen Esther Ostersund was born in Nørregalad in Olav Region, Norway, on 27 April 1903. She was raised in the Sonneviken barn in Magnik/Østfold, but the family moved to Oslo when Ostersund was six. In 1935 she was given a scholarship to Göttingen to study violin with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Her first concert was at the concert of Adolf Hitler's Dresden Kapellmeister. From 1938 to 1942, she taught privately and later privately as well as on-line with the University of Oslo. During that period she had a successful career in Norway, playing both with orchestras and university chamber ensembles. Ostersund became a master of both ensembles and was with orchestra since 1942. She held the positions of choir director at the local music school and of performance director in the town orchestra from 1943 to 1959. In the first half of the 1960s, she was rector of Bergensteket Lyre Hall and private music tutor to the great Norwegian poet Sarah Sørensen.

 From the late 1960s through the 1980s, Ostersund concentrated her efforts on pedagogical and pedagogical courses. From 1982 to 1995 she was professor of music at the University of Oslo, and she received her doctorate in 1972. Ostersund was first of the Scandinavian violinists to begin conducting solo and chamber ensembles in Norway, but her technique was not developed further. From 1961 she was a member of the orchestras of central Oslo, under her uncle, John Ostersund. She frequently taught privately, mainly with younger musicians.In 1986, she won a competition for a female concert hall, where she was seen as a symbol of femininity. She also presented the Nobel Prize in Music in 1998 to famous Norwegian violinist Geir Bahnsen.In 2003, Ostersund was awarded the Bruchynskafola Prize for the arts by the local council of the Central District of Oslo. Ostersund was succeeded by Harald Norden.  
 Ostersund taught violin with the Norwegians'Bergeri orchestra in Osnow, Solna, until 1960, when she switched to private lessons with female ensembles in the Norwegian countryside. In 1965 she founded the modern university of concert oratory, which has since been known as the Bergenstad Norske Tresangamu.The twentieth anniversary of Ostersund's birth was celebrated in 1987 with a concert in Oslo.

 = William Woodward (pastoralist) =  
William Woodward FRSE FRCPE ( 16 March 1838 – 12 August 1933 ) was an English lecturer in British languages. He is best known for his writings on the history of church history.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Woodward was born at Ewell, the first son of pastor John Woodward and his wife Annie, a pianist, of Bryn Terrace, London. His early education was in a gymnasium in Manchester, and the business of rector of a grammar school in Sheffield. He then spent some time in his father's school, in a preparatory school run by John Cobden. His early life, however, was not distinguished. He suffered from smallpox, and was educated privately until he was eighteen. He was educated for the medical profession, taking classes in pathology at the Sheffield Royal Infirmary.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 He was appointed postmaster at Sheffield in 1847, and afterwards at Mayton, South Yorkshire. During the years 1850-1851 he was the author orator at the Sheffield Synod, for which he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, 1852. In 1856 he was appointed professor of the History of Church History, and was a consultant to the Red Cross during the Great Misfortunes.In 1861, Woodward began his career as a teacher of the history of the church in Britain, a post he held until 1873. He was also in charge of the History of the British Church from its Reformation to the Present Day, and of the liturgical periodical The New Religion. At his death, he was closely associated with the Clarendon Foundation.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 His most important work is A Description of the Synodal Exhortations which was published in five volumes ( London, 1855 ). He also edited Hyrum Smith's The Church of England in 1848. Woodward's large collection of church records ( Cambridge, 1872 ) is still in use and contains 300,000 personal diaries of theologians, bishops, and clergy. His Masonic method of church history ( London, 1850 ) influenced the division of the Church of England into 12 Orders in the Second Vatican Council.Woodward is best known for his new series of The History of Church History in six parts, as a continuation of John Ray's ( 1827 ) work on the history of England. This series of books was highly regarded by G.W.F. Chalmers in 1880. Woodward's Church History of Britain was enthusiastically re-printed by the American scholar J.W. Dallender and William D'Herberard in 1882. Although no longer in print, that of Dallender and D'Herberard can still be found in a small number of publications, for example by Samuel Gladstone. He also published an edition of Sir William Paterson's Record of England in 1873. Woodward's lectures are accessible, but not free of errors ; like many of his contemporaries, he was opposed to Lycurgic editing.  
 Woodward wrote The Compleat Churchman ( 1866 ), which is still in print in editions by Walter Bagehot. In 1873, he wrote Two Englands, A Comparative and Preliminary History, 1652 to 1767. This work has become known as an essential treatise on church history.Woodward was also the author of A History of the First Early Church of Scotland, ( 1878 ) and Acts of the People of England, 1771-1773 ( Cambridge, 1894 ). Woodward's Canadian exegesis of the Bible ( 1900 ) was edited by his son with John Bradshaw in England.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 In 1880, Woodward married Eliza Woodway and their son was christened George. They had four daughters, whom he brought up by walking : Elizabeth, Lucy, Jane and Martha.Woodward's niece, Madeleine Woodward, married William Christian R. Wren, S.J.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Woodward is commemorated on the north east corner of St John the Evangelist Church in the Perthshire town of Chalk Hills, Derbyshire. His name is also on the central chapter of the New Testament biography of the first patriarch, Joseph the I, written in 1990 by John Simpson.

 = Mary Muldoon Ewing =  
Mary Muldoon Ewing ( 15 July 1842 – 11 April 1934 ) was a British anatomist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Ewing was born at 22 Sandlington in Berwickshire, Wales, and was educated at Sherborne's Grammar School. As a child she was friends with her brother John Seymour, and they would travel together often, and the summer they explored Scotland together. She had a nervous system of her own, and developed epilepsy as a consequence. Ewing died at the age of 12, after a long illness. She was survived by her parents and sister.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 The term `` Xylohemie '' ( in German, `` Ewingismus '' ) is used to refer to her views, which were very strongly grounded in her knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Ewing was a lecturer on anatomy at Newnham College, Cambridge for most of her life, but also worked as an anatomical lecturer and in the anatomical museum of his father, Herbert Russell Ewing. In addition to being recognised as an expert on limb structure, she was a keen amateur entomologist. Her greatest interest was in the insect chapter, and her treatment of the species Pandallinae. She also cared for severely malnourished orphans, both in her spare time, and after she had retired.  
 In 1882 Ewing published her second major publication, Lividity and Extinctions of the Mammalian Family Emphytenidae, a catalogue of Emphytenidae in which the species are grouped according to size, breeding material and vocalizations. She worked mainly with emphytetes, for which Emphytenidae are named.  
 Ewing also published numerous articles on insect anatomy and reproduction in the publication The Insects of the World ( 1884-85 ), which helped to popularise the attention she gave to this chapter of her work. Her observation of oviposition had a role in establishing the fact that sphecia were not `` tiny cells of capillaries in the endoplasm of cells of little size. `` Ewing also led several expeditions on expeditions to Egypt and Western Asia, her most notable one being from 1881 to 1886, her private expedition to Japan ( where she made copious notes on the insect migration patterns and species-level changes throughout the region ).

Hayashi Shihei ( 林 子平 , August 6 , 1738 - July 28 , 1793 ) was a Japanese military scholar and a retainer of the Sendai Domain .   
 His name is sometimes transliterated ( according to the Sino-Japanese reading ) as Rin Shihei ’ ' .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Hayashi was born in Edo as the second son of Hayashi Gonhyoue Yoshimichi , a 600 koku hatamoto who served the Tokugawa shogunate as commissioner for documents . However , when Hayashi was only three years old , his father was expelled for some reason and became a ronin . Hayashi and his brother were brought up by his uncle Hayashi Jyūgo , a physician .   
 However , Hayashi had an elder sister , Kiyo , in the service of Date Yoshimura at the Date clan residence in Edo . She became the concubine of the 6th daimyō of Sendai Domain , Date Munemura . Through her influence , Hayashi Jyūgo received an appointment as official doctor to Sendai Domain with a stipend of 150 koku , and Hayashi 's brother Hayashi Kazen was adopted as his heir . On Date Yoshimura 's death , they moved to Sendai ; however , Hayashi himself had no official post or stipend , and remained unemployed within the household .   
 He wrote a poem called `` Six No 's '' , which reads : `` I have no parents , no wife , no son , no block for printing , no money , and I wish for 'no death ' . ''   
 However , Hayashi was not idle . He maintained an active correspondence with many of the leading rangaku scholars , economists and military scientists of the day . He also travelled to Nagasaki in 1777 where he was especially impressed with the size and strength of the Dutch ships , and learned of Russian intentions to advance south from Siberia into Asia from the Dutch Opperhoofd . The caused him to make a journey to Matsumae in the north , and he increasing became aware of the weaknesses of the country 's coastal defences , and ignorance of the outside world .   
 In 1786 , he published Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu ( Illustrated Description of Three Countries ) , describing in detail Japan 's geopolitical position in relation to Korea , Ryukyu and Ezo . He raised concerns that China may one day attempt to invade Japan , as had been attempted in the Kamakura period , and also emphasized the need for Japan to populate and develop its northern frontier in Hokkaido .   
 In 1787 , he published Kaikoku Heidan ( i.e . Military Defense of a Maritime Nation ) , a 16-volume work in which he stressed Japan 's vulnerability from the sea and need for Japan to adopt Western military science and the re-education of the samurai . He complained of the lack of organized drill exercises , and stressed the importance of chōren , or teamwork drill , rather than mere individual martial training . He gave technical descriptions about shipbuilding , cannons and other military designs.He especially was critical of the Shogunate 's sakoku national isolation policy . The work generated great interest , but was banned in May 1792 , on the grounds that national security matters were being discussed without official consent . Hayashi was placed under house arrest . He died the following year.Together with Takayama Hikokurō and Gamō Sanbei , Hayashi is known as one of the `` Three Excelling Men of the Kansei Period '' ( Kansei no san-kijin 寛政の三奇人 ) .

After service in the Pacific as a meteorologist and radar officer in the Army Air Corps , Lally returned to M.I.T . where he received the degrees of B.S . in Electrical Engineering in 1948 and M.S , in Engineering Administration in 1949 . From 1951 to 1958 he worked at the Geophysics Research Directorate of the Air Force Cambridge Research Center where he was the leader of the meteorological equipment development program for the Air Force . From 1958 to 1961 he was manager of research at Teledynamics , Inc. , and then accepted appointment at the newly formed National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) as Director of the National Scientific Balloon Facility . In 1965 he established the Global Atmospheric Research Program ( GARP ) to develop long-duration balloons .   
    
    
 == Scientific achievements ==   
 In addition to leading the national program to develop facilities for scientific ballooning , Lally made a number of major contribution to the use of balloons as a vehicle for atmospheric measurements . The demonstration of the capability to fly superpressure balloons on multiple orbits of the globe was the critical experiment which triggered international support for the Global Atmospheric Research Program . In 1966 , NCAR scientists launched a globe-circling balloon from Christchurch , New Zealand . This was one of a series of global horizontal sounding technique ( GHOST ) balloons tested in order to collect meteorological data from all of the earth 's atmosphere and predict global weather on a long-range basis . The Rocket-Balloon-Instrument sphere ( ROBIN ) , designed in 1955 , was the principal vehicle for rocket soundings of the atmosphere . Lally also developed the technique for reliable erection of space-inflatables . The Radiation-Controlled Balloon ( RACOON ) demonstrated in 1980 that the radiation-environment rather than ballast could achieve long-duration flight for zero-pressure balloons . It became the standard technique for global flight and recovery of heavy scientific payloads .   
    
    
 == Publications ==   
 Lally authored over 30 papers on instrumentation , ballooning , and navigation techniques . he wrote the definitive publication on superpressure-ballooning as well as chapters in several handbooks on ballooning and atmospheric sounding systems .

 = Franz Anton Knittel =   
Franz Anton Knittel ( April 3 , 1721 – December 10 , 1792 ) was a German , Lutheran orthodox theologian , priest , and palaeographer . He examined palimpsests ' text of the Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis and deciphered text of Codex Carolinus . He was the author of many works .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
 In 1751 he became a priest , in 1753 Archdeacon of the main church in Wolfenbüttel . In 1766 he became general superintendent and the first preacher in Wolfenbüttel and in 1776 general superintendent in Brunswick .   
 After receiving work in the main church of Wolfenbüttel Knittel started to examine manuscripts housed in the Ducal Library of Wolfenbüttel . In 1756 he studied the Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis . The manuscript and its palimpsest text had earlier been examined by Heusinger , who described it in 1752 , but Knittel was the first who recognized that the palimpsest Greek text belonged to two different manuscripts of the New Testament . Knittel designated these two texts by sigla A and B . He recognized also lists of the κεφαλαια ( chapters ) as another , the third Greek manuscript . Knittel also deciphered and reconstructed the Gothic-Latin text of the palimpsest and published it in 1762 at Brunswick . It is known as Codex Carolinus . The upper text of palimpsest contains text of Isidore of Seville 's Origines and his six letters . Knittel designated it by siglum E and dated it to the 11th century .   
 Knittel made many errors in deciphering the palimpsest 's text , especially in the Latin text of Codex Carolinus ( e.g . enarrabilia for scrutabilia ) . Tischendorf made a new and more accurate collation for the Latin text ( edited in 1855 ) . A new collation of the Gothic text was published by Carla Falluomini in 1999 . Knittel examined also other manuscripts ( e.g . Minuscule 126 , 429 ) .   
 Knittel defended a traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism . He defended an authenticity of the Pericopa Adulterae ( John 7:53-8:11 ) , Comma Johanneum ( 1 John 5:7 ) , and Testimonium Flavianum . According to him Erasmus in his Novum Instrumentum omne did not incorporate the Comma from Codex Montfortianus , because of grammar differences , but used Complutensian Polyglotta . According to him the Comma was known for Tertullian .

 = Nicolas Durand =  
Nicolas Durand ( French : [ ˈdʒilh̯əçd ] ; 7 August 1796 – 16 June 1872 ) was a French mathematician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Nicolas Durand was born on 7 August 1796 in Toulouse, France. His father was an estate agent. At the age of fourteen he enrolled at the University of Strasbourg, where he received his M.A. in 1802. He then went on to pursue studies in mathematics, the natural sciences, and politics at the University of Toulouse, receiving his doctorate in 1808. In 1813, he was admitted to the chair of logic at the University of Leiden, and in 1815 he took a position as assistant to the mathematician Bernard Gombert. In 1817 he was appointed to the chair of logic at the University of Toulouse, where he remained until 1836. He also taught at the Sorbonne, the University of Paris, and at the universities of Basel and Berlin.  
 In 1826 Durand founded the journal Revue Generale. He was also the chief editor of the journal Reviews ( which he founded himself in 1816 ). It has been suggested that the long name Durandzeis de l'équationsgeographique can be derived from this journal. He wrote the first known treatise on elliptic functions. Durand ’ s work on the number of conic sections is regarded as being the most influential work on the problem of conic sections ever written. He invented the expression for the approximate solution of elliptic equations in geometry by applied functions, and improved the technique of matching polynomials to curves.

 = Oskar Jungreider =  
Oskar Jungreider ( 15 March 1849, in Rothenburg, Hesse-Darmstadt – 15 March 1927, in Berlin ) was a German physician.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jungreider was born in Rothenburg, and studied medicine in Halle and Berlin. In 1868, he received his habilitation and professorship in Berlin, from the latter which had belonged to Wilhelm Wetzler. Jungreider then returned to Halle to teach medicine and natural sciences, where he was appointed director of a rural training school. In 1889, after completing a medical doctoral degree in Munich, he became professor of general internal medicine at the University of Marburg, as well as dean of the medical faculty there. From 1893 to 1897, he was President of the Insel Charitable Society and also a member of the Bundestag. He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896. He married in 1895 Maria Edelmann, a nurse, to whom he had two daughters. The couple had five sons and one daughter. After his death, he is buried at Hildesheim Cemetery.Jungreider was the author of the systematic textbook Psychobiology ( 1886 ) and a large number of texts concerning local physicians, and took part in the discussion of diseases and customs of rural districts in the Zeitschrift für Medicin Obstheleitung.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 In 1874, Jungreider published his first major work concerning psychiatric disorders ( Zur Alterthumsamkeit der psychoses ) in the New York Medical Journal. In this work, Jungreider claimed that psychoses arose from the destruction of the `` sensory ego '' by the organs of the nervous system. Jungreider also gave cases to support his theories about malignant neurasthenia, agoraphobia, neurasthenia with Lewy bodies and pyramidal neurasthenia ( a type of cholera ). In 1885, he was also one of the leaders in German psychiatry during the period of the Silberstein's movement, a movement opposed to general psychiatry in Nazi Germany. His second major work is entitled Pathologische und Erbeungen aus Elektrizität ( Pathology and Essays about Electricity and Electricity Therapy ). In 1891, Jungreider published another work, Pathologische and Einheiten ( Pathological and Einheiten ). In this work, he advocated a complete recognition of `` electrical energy '', with its archetypal aspects, and of `` electromagnetic powers '' as such. Although this work was not translated into English, it is still in use today. He further specialized in brain disorders and neurophysiology.  
 Jungreider also wrote pharmacology, physiology, psychology and entomology.Jungreider is remembered for proposing a systematic treatment of neuropathy, that included psychosurgery, and, more recently, a theory of the pathological behavior of prostate cancer. According to the American journal, Addison-Wesley, the urologist and physiologist Carl Stanfield, ( 1899–1928 ), is the only one to use the term `` cancer '' to describe the disease. He may have come up with the term `` prostate cancer '' himself, given to him by himself.

 = Alexander Briant =   
Saint Alexander Briant ( 17 August 1556 – 1 December 1581 ) was an English Jesuit and martyr , executed at Tyburn .   
 He was born in Somerset , and entered Hart Hall , Oxford ( now Hertford College ) , at an early age . While there , he became a pupil of Father Robert Parsons and he completed his studies with him at Balliol College , which , along with his association with Richard Holtby , led to his conversion . After leaving university , he entered the English College at Reims then went to the English College , Douai , and was ordained priest on 29 March 1578 . Assigned to the English mission in August of the following year , he laboured with zeal in his own county of Somerset.A party of the persecution , searching for Father Parsons , placed Alexander Briant under arrest on 28 April 1581 . Arrested along with Briant was Gilbert Bodey , brother of John Bodey . Gilbert Bodey was scourged at Bridewell and afterwards confined to Counter Prison . He was released on bond , and when not called to appear , escaped to Rheims.In the hope of extorting information , Briant was sent to the Counter . After fruitless attempts to this end , he was taken to the Tower of London where he was subjected to torture . It was during this confinement that Briant penned his letter to the Jesuit Fathers in England requesting admission into the Society , which was granted . He was arraigned with six other priests on 16 November 1581 , in Queen 's Bench , Westminster , on the charge of high treason , and condemned to death . In his letter to the Jesuit Fathers he says that he felt no pain during the various tortures he underwent , and adds : `` Whether this that I say be miraculous or no , God knoweth . '' He was twenty-five years old when he was executed by being hanged , drawn and quartered on 1 December 1581 . Through either malice or carelessness of the executioner he was put to needless suffering . Edmund Campion and Ralph Sherwin were also executed with him.Alexander Briant was declared venerable on 8 December 1921 by Pope Pius XI and beatified one week later on 15 December .

 = Nikolaos Tsatsoulineas =  
Nikolaos Tsatsoulineas ( Hungarian : Δικολός Θυάριος ; 8 October 1741 – 11 October 1820 ) was a Hungarian entomologist and plant collector.  
 Tsatsoulineas first began collecting in the Silesian mountains near the town of Berzelinyi in 1772. He later traveled to Cretaceous times and collected insects and plants from large regions around the Balkan Peninsula. Beginning in 1776, Tsatsoulineas explored the Cretaceous formation, collecting plant material, insects, molluscs and invertebrates as well as fossils.  
 His main focus was botany, especially several taxa of the order Apis. In 1821 Tsatsoulineas discovered about 6,000 specimens from Silesian hydrocarbon deposits. However, the remains of M. boiziensis ( the pitcher plant ) are thought to be a contribution from Tsatsoulineas'earlier work in that year.  
 Many of the crustaceans and worms collected by Tsatsoulineas had later been described by Johannes von Laberdijk.  
 From 1782 to 1814, Tsatsoulineas was a professor of zoology at the Royal School of the Arts in Budapest.  
 His collections were destroyed during World War I but fragments of the research collections in the University's museum and several of his research specimens survived and were brought to Budapest to be studied. Tsatsoulineas died in 1820 and was interred in the Friedterkirchenhof. He is commemorated in the name of a species of edible lizard, Cotesia iniacea ( today Cotesia verdeana, probably the species described by Tsatsoulineas ).

In 1842 he became a professor in botany and natural history at the Société agricole de l'Etat ( to which he was transferred to in 1845 ).  
 The first volume of his numerous zoological books was dedicated to Dantin, who was one of the editors ; the third volume, De bryologie botanique ( 1843 ), contains great illustrations of ferns and the genus of plants. The author is not named, but it is certain that he was very much interested in plants from a practical point of view, and in botanical subjects as well. His services to the scientific literature were significant in the area of botany, and his articles on the genus Desmodium were published in the Phycologia Zoologica by Ferdinand Potier and Jean Richet.Dantin's main interest was the floral and fern families. His botanical works deal with a great many species, as well as the general systematics of species. Some of his illustrations are particularly useful. In the 3rd volume of A study of the species of the genus Desmodium, one of the species featured, Dantin noted the unusual chinstrap-like structure of the seed glands, and with this species Dantin was also the first to give the species name Desmodium gressulifera. The additional and more general names Desmodium angustifolium ( 1843 ) and Desmodium diefosca ( 1844 ) were likewise introduced.

Mary Celine Fasenmyer ( October 4 , 1906 , Crown , Pennsylvania – December 27 , 1996 , Erie , Pennsylvania ) was an American mathematician . She is most noted for her work on hypergeometric functions and linear algebra .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Fasenmyer grew up in Pennsylvania 's oil country , and displayed mathematical talent in high school . For ten years after her graduation she taught and studied at Mercyhurst College in Erie , where she joined the Sisters of Mercy . The religious sister pursued her mathematical studies in Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan , obtaining her doctorate in 1946 under the direction of Earl Rainville , with a dissertation entitled Some Generalized Hypergeometric Polynomials.After earning her Ph.D. , Fasenmyer published two papers which expanded on her doctorate work . These would be further elaborated by Doron Zeilberger and Herbert Wilf into `` WZ theory '' , which allowed computerized proof of many combinatorial identities . After this , she returned to Mercyhurst to teach and did not engage in further research .   
    
    
 == `` Sister Celine 's '' method ==   
 Fasenmyer is most remembered for the method that bears her name , first described in her Ph.D. thesis concerning recurrence relations in hypergeometric series . The thesis demonstrated a purely algorithmic method to find recurrence relations satisfied by sums of terms of a hypergeometric polynomial , and requires only the series expansions of the polynomial . The beauty of her method is that it lends itself readily to computer automation . The work of Wilf and Zeilberger generalized the algorithm and established its correctness .   
 The hypergeometric polynomials she studied are called Sister Celine 's polynomials .

John Lodge Cowley ( 1719 , United Kingdom – buried 1797 , United Kingdom ) was an English cartographer , geologist and mathematician .   
 John Cowley was a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , London , for a number of years between 1761 and 1773 . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April , 1768.His mathematical methods were famous , but he was also an important geographer as well as Cartographer Royal to King George II . He specialised in maps that depicted the counties of the United Kingdom from which arose his most famous work , Counties of England . Cowley published several maps , many of minute detail , and on them often appeared his name although on others appeared the name of Emanuel Bowen acting as engraver . Another one of his works of some note , but less famous than The Counties , was A new and easy introduction to the study of geography which was published by Thomas Cox and James Hodges . The work was structured as questions and answers with decorative maps added later . His maps contained longer titles than those usually found on the standard miniature maps . John Cowley collaborated with Robert Dodsley for several years in the creation of his maps which explains why the maps were ascribed to Dodsley/Cowley . Among his works are remembered the superb engravings representing the constellation drawn on glass globes created by Thomas Heath .   
 He also published a number of introductory works on solid geometry incorporating fold-up figures : Geometry Made Easy ( 1752 ) , An Appendix to Euclid 's Elements ( 1758 ) and The Theory of Perspective Demonstrated ( 1765 ) .He taught geometry to subscribers of the St. Martin 's Lane Academy , a drawing school established by William Hogarth and John Ellys.Cowley died in Walworth , Surrey . He had a daughter called Mrs Johnstone who inherited her father 's passion for science and over the years instructed many members of the British nobility in the use of globes and maps .

 = Granville Penn =   
Granville Penn ( 9 December 1761 – 28 September 1844 ) was a great-grandson of Admiral Sir William Penn , a British author , and scriptural geologist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was born 9 December 1761 in Spring Gardens , London , the second surviving son of Thomas Penn and his wife , Lady Juliana Fermor Penn , fourth daughter of Thomas , first Earl of Pomfret . He studied at Magdalen College , Oxford , but did not complete his degree . He then became an assistant clerk in the war department .   
 In the period from 1788 Penn played a part in the development of veterinary education . A supporter of the Odiham Society , he met Charles Benoît Vial de Sainbel who was in England for the second time to try to set up a veterinary school , such as existed at Lyon ; and whose profile was raised when he was asked to dissect the famous racehorse Eclipse . Penn ran a successful campaign over a few years to implement his own version of Sainbel 's original scheme . The Veterinary College , London opened its doors to pupils at the beginning of 1792.In 1834 Penn succeeded his brother , John Penn , in the estates of Stoke Park , Buckinghamshire , and Pennsylvania Castle , Portland.He died at Stoke Park on 28 September 1844 . He had married Isabella , the eldest daughter of General Gordon Forbes and had 4 sons and 5 daughters .   
    
    
 == Writings ==   
 Penn , fluent in French , Greek , Latin and Hebrew , was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and wrote several books dealing with Biblical criticism and published a number of competent translations of ancient Greek works , including a critical revision of the English version of the New Testament . He also wrote some theological works particularly related to Biblical chronology ( past and future ) and the early history of post-Flood mankind . In 1833 he wrote the Life of Admiral Sir William Penn , on his great-grandfather .   
    
    
 === A Comparative Estimate ===   
 His major work as a scriptural geologist was A Comparative Estimate of the Mineral and Mosaical Geologies , published in 1822 . Penn added a supplement in 1823 in response to Buckland 's theory on Kirkdale Cave , and then revised and enlarged it to two volumes in 1825 in response to criticisms . Like most Scriptural geologists , Penn , whose name became indelibly associated with Scriptural geology , participated only transiently with it during his career . For example , between the production of his book when he was 62 and his death in 1844 he focused on philological scholarship .   
    
    
 ==== Attitude toward geology ====   
 Penn wrote that `` The science of Geology … has this remarkable character above all the preceding physical sciences ; that , it not only conducts the intelligence , like them , to the discernment of the God of Nature , but advances it further , to a distinct recognition of that God of Nature in the God of Scripture .

 = Jacques-Louis Agard =  
Jacques-Louis Agard ( 28 November 1860 – 2 August 1949 ) was a French zoologist who discovered in 1876 that the human digestive tract contained a mucus layer rich in amoebae. This discovery was the start of a successful modern field of research of amoebozoans.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Agard studied at the Paris Natural History Museum and the École normale supérieure. While an instructor at the École Normale Supérieure, Agard observed during 1888 in a field trip to la Chapelle de Crécy an example of autolytic amoeba, a group of small amoebic larvae containing the larvae of Euterpe and Trichogrammatode. He discovered that the larvae of Euterpe, which are generally not eaten in this country, contain the chameleon larvae for feeding, and in the presence of lacustrine eggs, the larva begins to develop into autolytic amoebae and in 1886 discovered autolytic amoebae in a small swamp.  
 From 1889, he taught at the École de chimie des sciences sur la France. In 1895 he returned to his native town and published in French the findings of his excavation at the Salle de la Loire on the island of Antigua. The work was important for science in his home country because the absence of any proof of entomological distinctions between the species was brought to light. The work was widely studied and proved that it was the oral bacteria of Coccidia which were the cause of skin disease. Agard was the first European to distinguish the toxins produced by Coccidia from its protozoa. ( This experiment was later dubbed the Agard-Aspirin–Bototropis experiment. )  
 As a distinguished scientist, Agard became a close friend and associate of botanist Auguste Lamarck.  
 He became professor at the Ecole polytechnique and the chair of zoology at the same university ( 1958–1961 ), but his first scientific published work on amoebae was in 1903. The bibliography for these papers is widely available at the Amazon in Mémoires sous l ’ Académie des sciences et naturelles de France, Annuel de l ’ Université de Strasbourg, du règne Fondation, Bibliothèque bibliothèque des Sciences et des Arts Naturales et Le Départements du Méditerranée ( published on 16 December 1913 by G.-M. Coté ).  
 In 1904, Agard worked for 3 years on experiments involving the growth of a host by means of a broiler. His first published paper on this subject was `` Zur Differentiationkunde der Vertebrateen '' ( on the development of the embryo in fishes ). In the same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Jacques Fabien Gautier d'Agoty ( 1716–1785 ) was a French anatomist , painter and printmaker .   
 D'Agoty was born in Marseille , and became a pupil of the painter and engraver Jacob Christoph Le Blon , with whom he became a rival for title of the invention of a method of an color-printing method based on etching and mezzotint engraving . He later exploited this process with his four sons : it is significant that he published a journal that included color printed images .   
 Gautier d'Agoty was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences , Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon , he teamed with the physician and anatomist Guichard Joseph Duverney to produce anatomical albums . Together with his son , Jean-Baptiste André Gautier-Dagoty , they produced a French Gallery and universal gallery of portraits of famous men and women , which only appeared in the first deliveries in 1770 and 1772 . D'Agoty died in Paris .

Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz ( Russian : Евге́ний Миха́йлович Ли́фшиц ; February 21 , 1915 , Kharkov , Russian Empire – October 29 , 1985 , Moscow , Russian SFSR ) was a leading Soviet physicist and brother of the physicist Ilya Lifshitz .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Lifshitz is well known in the field of general relativity for coauthoring the BKL conjecture concerning the nature of a generic curvature singularity . As of 2006 , this is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in the subject of classical gravitation.With Lev Landau , Lifshitz co-authored Course of Theoretical Physics , an ambitious series of physics textbooks , in which the two aimed to provide a graduate-level introduction to the entire field of physics . These books are still considered invaluable and continue to be widely used .   
 Lifshitz was the second of only 43 people ever to pass Landau 's `` Theoretical Minimum '' examination . He made many invaluable contributions , in particular to quantum electrodynamics , where he calculated the Casimir force in an arbitrary macroscopic configuration of metals and dielectrics .   
 A special multicritical point , the Lifshitz point , carries , since 1975 , his name .

 = Charles Rigby Silliman =  
Charles Rigby Silliman ( 10 June 1892 – 1 January 1995 ) was an English journalist and political journalist. He was a professor of philosophy at University of Edinburgh.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Charles Silliman was born in Edmonton, Alberta in 1892. He was educated at Hillfield School in Devon, but, shortly before graduating, he joined a far-right press shop to serve as a press secretary in the Washingon Patriot Mail Office, where he was called to a British Government job as correspondent for the official newspaper of the Temperance movement.  
   
   
 == Opposition to the war ==  
 In 1910 he joined the Union of Socialist Labour ( U.S.S.R. ), and was drafted into the American Second World War. For the next few years, he fought in Europe, including a bitter campaign against German occupiers in World War I. He was awarded the Second Lieutenant's Badge of Military Merit, while others received naval decorations.Silliman joined the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and joined the Communist Party ( KPD ), the National Socialist German Workers'Party, which was banned by the Nazis. For his first decade in England, Silliman produced a series of critical articles for the Communist Press Club and other radical newspapers. In July 1940, he left for London, and remained there for four months.  
 In February 1942, Silliman joined the L.P. ( Loyalist ), but switched sides at the start of the German-Russian War and became an intelligence officer with the British army, before becoming Assistant to the Allied Commandant in the Atlantic and in Egypt. He later joined the U.S. Army.  
   
   
 == Later career ==  
 In 1943, with the assistance of Erich Fromm, Silliman organized a huge underground campaign on behalf of the KPD and its Russian sympathizers, which became known as the `` Booker Affair. '' He was arrested and imprisoned, and as a result of his work, the government charged Silliman and 10 others for anti-war activity. His trial took place in Kraków and was well attended ; newspapers as far afield as the BBC, Radio Free Europe, and The New York Times were critical of the government's handling of the trial. When he was acquitted in 1945, he and Fromm were awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. During this period, Silliman moved to Cambridge to continue his work with the U.S. Army Intelligence Service ( S.I.S. ). He became a professor at the University of Cambridge, and then went on to teach a course in philosophy at the University of Edinburgh.  
 After the war, Silliman returned to the lecture stage and appeared as a guest of the Society for Economic Administration, a conservative think-tank. In 1955, Silliman was expelled from the group, along with Evand D Coster, an American academic specializing in American historical thought.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 After retiring in 1962, Silliman became Director of Columbia University's Heriot–Watt Laboratory for Advanced Studies. In 1974, Silliman edited a biography of Camille Paglia, The Spirit of Paglia ( Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1979 ), and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. In his later years, he undertook his own biography of David Goodman.In 1989, he was divorced from his second wife, Lorin Gorelick, and married Elinor McFadden, who had also retired from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. When her interests moved to the posthumous publication of Counting Sheep in 1994, Silliman received his share of attention, and was awarded the Alexander Hildegarde Steenoe Memorial Prize in Economic Ethics by the Federation for American Studies. He died in Edinburgh, Scotland on 1 January 1995.

 = John Barnes (painter) =  
John Barnes ( 31 July 1779 – 11 April 1856 ) was an English preacher and churchman known for his work on the architecture of the Roman Catholic Church.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 In 1778, Barnes was born to his family in Bristol, England. His father was a surgeon. In 1782, Barnes entered Christ's College, Cambridge, and proceeded to study medicine under Dr James Fuller, leaving to study architecture. He gained an LL.B. in 1793, and after two years spent at Christ's, he went to England.  
 In 1795 he received a professorship in Catholic philosophy, and thereafter he worked for several years in Denmark and his native England. He died in 1856.  
   
   
 == Early work ==  
 During his university career, Barnes studied Roman Catholic architecture, especially church plan. He noted the `` traditional roof of the cottage-cabin '', and the enclosure roof of the Gothic Church of Notre Dame cathedral. He wrote in 1803 his monograph on the `` plan of the cathedral of Rome '' ( a work for which the Cologne cathedral is particularly notable ). Barnes was a noted artist, and there are 20 detailed plates of paintings ( of brick, of woods, etc. ) in his library ( c. 1893 ).  
 Barnes included also the `` arch of the Gothic '' of Pope Gregory XVI. The title is a pun of Barnes'suggestion : `` Arch in glanzer archem paravisen '' ( `` Arch in Greek Paradise '' ) ; a phrase he often used, used as an argument of the Bishop of Oxford's `` forbidding '' to close the School of Architecture to Lutheran enrollment.  
 A valuable document is the `` appendix to the castle at St. Regis '' ( Boscobel ) ( appended for the convenience of the Bishop of Milan in 1805 ), arranged in the following orders :  
   
 ARCHEL OSMITH - ABADER I - MABIE V - DELI - ARROPELI - ERNSANDO - HAUGHEY - HARRISI - LEBOUT, - MASELAIS - NAYOMIS - POSNAN, - SALOR, - SCHUDRACH - SILVA - SOCCERUS - SOTORIS - TURTULA, - THEODOREI, - ULBRICH, - VIRGINISZEWSKI, - WARIEWSKI, - WALES, - WHITLEY, – ZAMALA,  
 ARCHENAC - ZIMMERO - MILESZO -  
   
   
 == Architecture ==  
 Barnes was the author of over two hundred architectural drawings, and in 1809 completed a design for the Roman Catholic Cathedral at St. Regis, now one of the oldest churches in Germany, with an interior tower a few metres in height. He described his plans in several works, two of them published in Le Monde Revue and Lettres sur le Monde, and at a second exhibition held in London in 1813.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 A detailed biography of Barnes is given in the  
 Harry Chapman Baker Historical Dictionary. The biography by J. W. Atkinson is about both the influence of Barnes on Bishop Ward and also was a master of British obituaries and commentaries.  
 Barnes'last academic work was the Deutsche Insekten der Heiligen Werther ( Deutsche Museum of Modern Art ), named after the state in which he spent the last decade of his life. The remarkable artists who created this monumental building were close to his heart, including Paul Schumann, an important architect of his time, and a Prussian patron. Barnes died at his home at Boscobel, near Cologne, on 11 April 1856.

Ernest Hutcheson ( 20 July 1871 – 9 February 1951 ) was an Australian pianist , composer and teacher .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Hutcheson was born in Melbourne , and toured there as a child prodigy at the age of five . He later travelled to Leipzig and entered the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of fourteen to study with Carl Reinecke , Bernhard Stavenhagen ( a pupil of Franz Liszt ) and Bruno Zwintscher . He was part of the London music circuit in 1896 and 1897 . Prior to the outbreak of World War I he taught at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin , but in 1914 he settled in New York City , where he made his US debut .   
 He is believed to have been the first pianist to play three concertos of Ludwig van Beethoven in a single concert : his performances of Beethoven 's third , fourth and fifth with the New York Symphony Orchestra in the Aeolian Hall in 1919.He became a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School , and successively Dean ( 1926–1937 ) and President ( 1937–1945 ) of the school . At Juilliard , he championed the use of radio musical broadcasts in education.He taught many first-rate students . One of these many students was Mary Ann Craft , who later taught the prodigy Edgar Coleman during his formative years . Two other students who went on to important pianistic careers were the American Abram Chasins , and the Australian Bruce Hungerford . He also taught Muriel Kerr , a winner of the Naumberg Competition who made her Carnegie Hall debut 5 December 1928 in Rachmaninoff 's Concerto No . 2 with the Philharmonic SO of New York conducted by Mengelberg . She became Hutcheson 's assistant at Juilliard and later toured under Columbia Artists Management , settling finally in Los Angeles where she taught at the University of Southern California . Hutcheson was a member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity .   
    
    
 == At Chautauqua ==   
 Hutcheson was also associated with the Chautauqua School of Music at the Chautauqua Institution in Western New York State . Hutcheson provided a much needed refuge for George Gershwin at Chautauqua during the stressful period of composing and refining the Piano Concerto in F. Since Gershwin was already very famous as a successful writer of popular works and musical shows , he was constantly besieged by admirers . Further , he had never scored a large symphonic work ( the earlier Rhapsody in Blue had been scored for jazz band by Gershwin , but was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé ) and was under great stress from the pressing deadline expectations from Walter Damrosch , conductor of the New York Symphony , who had commissioned the Concerto in F. Thanks to Ernest Hutcheson 's kind offer of seclusion for Gershwin at Chautauqua where his quarters were declared off limits to everyone until 4 p.m. daily , Gershwin was able to successfully complete his piano concerto on time .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Ernest Hutcheson wrote concertos for piano ; 2 pianos ; and violin , and many solo piano works , such as a transcription of Wagner 's Ride of the Valkyries . His music has been little heard in concert or on recordings , but his Australian compatriot Ian Munro has recorded some of his piano pieces .   
 Hutcheson wrote important books The Literature of the Piano , The Elements of Piano Technique , , A Musical Guide to Richard Wagner 's Ring of the Nibelung , and Elektra , by Richard Strauss : a Guide to the Opera with Musical Examples from the Score , among others .

She and her sister both went to Great Yarmouth, Maine, and studied to become ministers of the Methodist Church there. Madeleine was secretary to the Methodist General Assembly from 1919 to 1920, and president of the Shropshire Presbyterian Society in 1920-1921. She was imprisoned in Hull Prison between 1926-29 for moral offences. Her brother, Edmund Thomas Hutchinson, was the musical editor of The Young Folks'Quarterly and a noted opera composer.  
 In 1923 Madeleine married Reginald Blake, a Cambridge law student who had succeeded her father as college organist, and had three sons and a daughter. After her husband's death in 1934, she remained at Shrewsbury College, Kent, where she died in 1948, aged 87. The two other daughters married other men, including John William Hiller of Belchers Green, a miner and explosives inspector.  
 She married Ettore Ostergren in 1934 ; she had been married to Ostergren for several years, though remained his mistress after the death of their son in 1943.Madeleine was the author of a five-volume musical anthology, Together Time for the Glory and Bright-Green ( 1935–38 ).

Alphonse Malaquin ( 24 October 1868 – 22 April 1949 ) was a French zoologist born in the village of Cambrésis . He is known for his research of Polychaeta ( class of annelids ) .   
 In 1888 he began work as an assistant at the zoological laboratory at the Faculté des Sciences in Lille . In 1895 he defended his doctorate with a highly regarded thesis on the annelid family Syllidae , titled Recherches sur les Syllidiens . Morphologie . Anatomie Reproduction . Développement .   
 In 1906 he attained the chair of general and applied zoology at Lille , and during the following years established a laboratory and museum of applied zoology . During World War I both facilities sustained extensive damage , with restoration and re-installation taking several years to complete , the museum being reopened to the public as late as 1925 . In 1919 Malaquin was named chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur , and in 1937 became an officer ( year of retirement ) .   
 A species of monstrillid copepod known as Cymbasoma malaquini ( Caullery & Mesnil , 1914 ) is named after him .

Leo Alexander ( October 11 , 1905 – July 20 , 1985 ) was an American psychiatrist , neurologist , educator , and author , of Austrian-Jewish origin . He was a key medical advisor during the Nuremberg Trials . Alexander wrote part of the Nuremberg Code , which provides legal and ethical principles for scientific experiment on humans .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born in Vienna , Austria-Hungary , Alexander was the son of a physician . He graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School in 1929 , interned in psychiatry at the University of Frankfurt , then emigrated to the United States in 1933 . He taught at the medical schools of Harvard University and Duke University . During the war , he worked in Europe under United States Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson as an army medical investigator with the rank of Major . After the war , he was appointed chief medical advisor to Telford Taylor , the U.S. Chief of Counsel for War Crimes , and participated in the Nuremberg Trials in November 1946 . He conceived the principles of the Nuremberg Code after observing and documenting German SS medical experiments at Dachau , and instances of sterilization and euthanasia . Alexander later wrote that `` science under dictatorship becomes subordinated to the guiding philosophy of the dictatorship . `` Later , he served as assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Tufts University Medical School , where he stayed for almost 30 years . As a consultant for the Boston Police Department , Alexander was instrumental in solving the Boston Strangler case . He directed the Multiple Sclerosis Center at Boston State Hospital , where he researched multiple sclerosis and studied neuropathology . He arranged for the treatment of 40 German Nazi concentration camp victims who had been injected by Dr. Josef Mengele with a precursor to gas gangrene , and provided them with psychiatric therapy . Alexander wrote several books on psychiatry and neuropathology , and coined the terms thanatology—defined as the study of death—and ktenology—the science of killing.Alexander was a leading proponent of electroconvulsive ( shock ) therapy and insulin shock therapy . According to psychiatrist Peter Breggin , Alexander – who was German-trained and German-speaking – was also an early eugenicist , and the failure of the Doctor trials to bring psychiatrists to justice was due in part to Alexander being the chief investigator.Alexander died of cancer in 1985 in Weston , Massachusetts , survived by three children .

 = August Beer =   
August Beer ( German : [ beːɐ̯ ] ; 31 July 1825 – 18 November 1863 ) was a German physicist , chemist , and mathematician of Jewish descent .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Beer was born in Trier , where he studied mathematics and natural sciences . Beer was educated at the technical school and gymnasium of his native town until 1845 , when he went to Bonn to study mathematics and the sciences under the mathematician and physicist Julius Plücker , whose assistant he became later . In 1848 he won the prize for his essay , `` De Situ Axium Opticorum in Crystallis Biaxibus , '' and obtained the degree of Ph.D. Two years later he was appointed lecturer at the University of Bonn .   
 In 1852 , Beer published a paper on the absorption of red light in coloured aqueous solutions of various salts . Beer makes use of the fact , derived from Bouguer 's and Lambert 's absorption laws , that the intensity of light transmitted through a solution at a given wavelength decreases exponentially with the path length d and the concentration c of the solute ( the solvent is considered non-absorbing ) . Actually , the “ Absorption Coëfficient ” defined by Beer in his paper is the transmittance ( or transmission ratio ) , T = I / I0 . Thus , as pointed out by Beer , the transmittance of a concentrated solution can be derived from a measurement of the transmittance of a dilute solution .   
 Indeed , the transmittance measured for any concentration and path length can be normalized to the corresponding transmittance for a standard concentration and path length . Beer in a number of experiments confirms this , defining a standard concentration of 10 % , and a standard path length of 10 cm . The photometer , devised by Beer , is shown in the gallery below .   
 Beer continued to publish the results of his scientific labors , writing in 1854 Einleitung in die höhere Optik ( Introduction to the Higher Optics ) . His findings , together with those of Johann Heinrich Lambert , make up the Beer–Lambert law . In 1855 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Bonn . Beer also wrote `` Einheit in der Electrostatik , '' published two years after his death . He died in Bonn in 1863 .   
    
    
 == Beer 's law ==   
 Beer 's law , also called Lambert–Beer law or Beer–Lambert law , in spectroscopy , is the physical law stating that the quantity of light absorbed by a substance dissolved in a nonabsorbing solvent is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance and the path length of the light through the solution . Beer 's law is commonly written in the form A = ε cl , where A is the absorbance , c is the concentration in moles per liter , l is the path length in centimeters , and ε is a constant of proportionality known as the molar extinction coefficient . The law is accurate only for dilute solutions ; deviations from the law occur in concentrated solutions because of interactions between molecules of the solute , the substance dissolved in the solvent .

 Schafer was born at Weihensee, near Koblenz, but, being inclined to the Roman Catholic faith, was baptized into the Lutheran Church in Koblenz. He entered the seminary at Koblenz and studied theology. In 1833 he was appointed, as rector of Salzburg, to the chair of dogmatics and theology. He had a brief but a fruitful friendship with J. E. Schubert, who afterwards became his assistant. He was at first assigned the chair of Hebrew grammar and the abbreviation of `` Schum ''. In 1837 Schafer resigned his appointment in order to give a very liberal course of lectures. In 1841 he was appointed pastor of Peschen.  
 He was at first sent to North America in 1846 to succeed C. S. Lewis, but on the death of Lewis, he was appointed first to a professorship at St. Catharine's, and then to one at New Ulm, Minnesota, where he had been appointed professor of Greek and Hebrew in 1836. From 1849 to 1853 he was professor of Hebrew at the University of Copenhagen.  
 On the death of E. R. Hanssen, of Johannesburg, he was chosen professor of Greek at the University of Berlin. His successor, Carl Wilhelm Leif Bender, was the teacher of numerous Orientalists in Europe. From 1858 to 1861 he was professor of philology in Rome.  
 In the later years of his life, his time was occupied chiefly in his linguistic studies, and in 1859 he was made professor of philology at the University of Leipzig, where he served from 1862 to 1866.  
 In 1855 he obtained the gold medal of the German Academy of Sciences for his Liber Cursus. From the following year to 1860 he became distinguished as distinguished for his translations from Greek and Latin. He completed an English version in 1860, and also published, in 1860, an Oriental dictionary, which was in a very nearly completed state. In 1857 he founded the Franckischen Biographien des Göttingen, which included under its head a German translation of Rameau's Elementary Arabic.  
 He died in Leipzig in 1891.

 = Charles K C3 B6ster =  
Charles Karl Köster ( 18 November 1881 – 14 January 1965 ) was a Swedish economist who served as a professor of economics at the University of Chicago from 1924 to 1961. The University of Chicago is named in his honor.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Charles Karl Köster was born in Kolmasen, and studied at the Department of Economics of the Swedish Imperial University in Köthen, from which he graduated with a doctorate in 1927. His doctoral work was entitled `` Uppenbarne statistischer Societas förförbundskola veränderelserelse Statistiska Experimentationer aktive Selning som världsktningen '' ( The Legal Institutions of a Statistical State Experiment. The Research into a Social State Experiment ). The first translation of the book into Swedish into English was published in 1930, following a reprint.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Köster had originally studied at a college in Stockholm. As a result, he became acquainted with Carl Menger. Both, he and the Kaiser's health insurance company, Knaurer, tried to organize the Swedish socialists to obtain a much-needed strike. But despite a refusal from the Kaiser's health insurance company, and difficulties obtaining insurance coverage from it, all attempts failed. Köster, having found the scientific methods used by Menger ’ s work and is now using those methods himself, became acquainted with and a believer in the theoretical ideas of Karl Marx. Karl Marx himself, even at this early stage, had a close friend in Köster. Köster, like other progressives of the time, was also the President of the St. Louis Anti-Saloon League. He had become a Marxist and became an intellectual representative of the Jacobin Society.  
 In 1928, the Swedish Social Democratic Party succeeded in becoming the governing party in Sweden. Köster left the Social Democratic Party in 1934, supporting the social democracy led by Alfred Nobel.In 1934, the Kaiser's health insurance company ( Jonsson skalbart ) was dissolved. Swedish President of the Swedish Social Democratic Party-elect, Gustaf Godräther, wished to deal with the fallout from the dissolution of the health insurance company that they might get insurance from the state, and Köster found the financial difficulties he encountered in Köthen ( i.e., for the time being, his salary as professor of economics ) overwhelming. Köster spent two years on an unpaid research job at the Lund University. He started a PhD under the supervision of Jonsson, which resulted in the production of a book entitled `` Statistiska i världskonomiska analytiska statistiska experimenta ( Theory of Statistics and Its Applications ). '' The book is perhaps the first serious attempt at understanding the causes of the Great Depression and what one can do about it.  
 Köster remained in Lund until 1937 when he obtained a chair in economic statistics at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( 2012 : New York : Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0-19-2033887-7 ). There he studied the trend in the Swedish market rate between 1906 and 1938, and thus came to work on the development of a national inflation index. His theories about the nature of investment and unemployment, as well as about the economic impact of international trade, influenced the policy debate of the day. He was the co-founder and President of the Aarhus School of Economics in 1946.  
 From 1948 to 1958, Köster served as a professor in the department of economics at the University of Chicago ( 1947–1960 ). He left the faculty to become a visiting professor in Stockholm in 1960, an arrangement which continues to this day. He died in 1965.

Hans Walter Kosterlitz FRS ( 27 April 1903 – 26 October 1996 ) was a German-born British biologist..   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Kosterlitz earned a Doctor of Medicine ( Dr. med ) at Humboldt University of Berlin . He emigrated to Scotland in 1934 , after the Nazi takeover in Germany led to antisemitic legislation that barred him from his job at Charité in Berlin . The affair shocked him and he fled to the UK , and after obtaining work in the UK , he was able to obtain safe-haven for his mother , brother , and fiancée Hanna . He joined the staff of University of Aberdeen in the same year , as an Assistant in the Physiology Department . Over the years he was a Carnegie Teaching Fellow , Lecturer , Senior Lecturer , and finally Reader . In 1968 , Aberdeen established a new Department of Pharmacology , which was headed by Kosterlitz as professor until 1973 , when he became director of the university 's drug addiction research unit.Kosterlitz is best known for his work as one of the key discoverers of endorphins . He stimulated the mouse isolated vas deferens electrically and recorded its contractions with a polygraph . He then found that if you added opiates to the solution , the muscle would not contract . Opiates inhibited the contraction . Those contractions were later found to resume in the presence of both opiates and an antagonist such as naloxone . Later , endogenous endorphins were discovered by applying pig brain cell homegenate to the apparatus . This caused the contractions to cease . The degree to which an opiate agonist inhibits contractions of the mouse vas deferens , and other tissues like the guinea pig ileum , is highly correlated to its potency as an analgesic .   
 Kosterlitz was given the Scheele Award in 1977 , and shared the Albert Lasker Award with John Hughes and Solomon H. Snyder in 1978 for his work in the discovery of the opiate receptors and their natural ligands . The Kosterlitz Centre at the University of Aberdeen , opened on 16 September 2010 , is named in his honour .   
 Hans Kosterlitz was married , since 1937 , to Hanna Greßhöner . Their son , J. Michael , is Professor of Physics at Brown University , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016

 He studied natural sciences at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences ( KNA ), graduated in botany, geology, zoology and mathematics from the Royal Veterinary School, Vorderenboek. In 1882 he won the post of professor of embryology and evolution at the zoology school in Amsterdam and in 1892, of zoology in the zoology school in Groningen. The Rooker-Fisher equation is named after him.  
 In 1892 he published a description of the fossils of the age of the Mousterian ( Jurassic ) taxa, co-author with Charles Lyell Fleming, who interpreted them to be representatives of human ancestors, based on the geological evidence of the Passeretjibbonian ( roughly between the Upper Cretaceous and Jurassic epoch ), Rooker's earliest fossil section, dated from the Triassic Period. Rooker, Fleming and Fleming believed that the fossil `` Pleuronectes '' was originally used by the early humans as an indicator for sex or relationship. In 1902 Fleming and Fleming presented to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences a catalogue of vertebrates discovered from these areas. In 1910 Rooker published an edition of their works which had first appeared in 1905. In 1920, in an article by Mendel Lieben in Naturalis Biologica, Rooker and Lieben estimated the age of most of the living and extinct mammal species ( known and named ) to be between 24 million and 24 million years old.

 = William John of Clarendon =  
William John of Clarendon FRSE ( 15 December 1825 – 19 December 1886 ) was an English meteorologist. He was the brother of Michael John of Clarendon ( 1818–1895 ) and brother of Robert John of Clarendon ( 17 June 1822 – 5 October 1892 ).  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 William John was born in Charleville, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Northampton College, and completed a degree in chemistry with degrees in 1836 and 1837. In 1845 he became an assistant at the observatory in Rome, and by 1870 was employed as a weather forecaster.  
 As a meteorologist, he was chiefly interested in atmospheric temperature, which involved meteorological observations made by meteorologists in all parts of the world. In 1856 he was sent by his brother Michael to Rome to study geophysics under Charles Scocco, examining the valleys and surface of the earth and the atmosphere as it shifted due to Earth rotation. This led him to the conclusion that the fine pressure difference between the seabed and the atmosphere causes the volume of the atmosphere to rise and fall, as the distance between the two lines of pressure changes with Earth's axis of rotation. On some such consideration he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1859. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1860, and of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1872. He served as the Secretary of the British Association for the Advancement of Science between 1877 and 1881. He was also awarded an Honorary Degree ( D.Sc. ) from Oxford University in 1884.

 = Ren C3 A9 Jeannel =   
René Jeannel ( 23 March 1879 – 20 February 1965 ) was a French entomologist . He was director of the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle from 1945 to 1951 . Jeannel 's most important work was on the insect fauna of caves in the Pyrenees , France and in the Carpathians , Romania . He also worked in Africa . Jeannel specialised in Leiodidae ( then Silphidae or Catopidae ) but authored a large number of papers and works on other Coleoptera . He was a member of the Romanian Academy .   
 As the son of a medical officer in the French military , Jeannel was expected to succeed his father . However , after developing an interest , during his studies in Toulouse , in cave exploration and especially cave fauna , he began considering a career in biological science instead . His interest was especially stimulated when he discovered two new cave beetles in the Grotte d ’ Oxibar ( named after him by Abeille de Perrin : Bathyscia jeanneli and Aphaenops jeanneli.In 1905 he began a life-long friendship and collaboration with Romanian biologist Emile Racovitza . In the first 17 years alone they jointly explored 1,400 caves in southern Europe and North Africa and published descriptions of the caves and their fauna . When Racovitza was invited to found a biospeleological institute in Cluj , Jeannel became his deputy director until 1927 , when Jeannel obtained a chair in entomology in the Paris museum.Despite his administrative positions , Jeannel remained a productive scientist . In 1911 , when he published his 641-page , 657-illustration doctoral thesis on Leptodirini ( then called Bathysciinae ) , he had already produced more than 30 papers . During the rest of his career , he added another 500 scientific publications to this total , together amounting to more than 20,000 published pages—mostly on cave insects and all illustrated by himself.Jeannel 's most important contribution to taxonomy was the fact that he realised the potential of using the genitalia for species identification and classification . Genitalia evolve faster than external parts of the body and therefore the differences between species are greater . In his book l ’ Édéage ( 1955 ) , he summarized all the insights the study of the aedeagus ( the term used for the male beetle genital apparatus ) had afforded him .

He was not the only candidate : William Jones , a lawyer and linguist , also applied . He had a reputation as a radical , and although Ford was `` a comparative nonentity '' ( in the words of Jones 's biographer ) , he had the advantage of having married the niece of a bishop , and so `` nepotism and politics triumphed '' .Ford obtained his Master of Arts degree in 1783 . When Matthew Lamb , the Principal of Magdalen Hall , resigned in 1788 , Ford was his successor . He obtained a doctorate in civil law in the same year : it was customary at the time for the heads of colleges and halls to have a doctoral degree . He then `` retired as much as he could from the public view '' , wrote one historian of Hertford College ( a successor institution to Magdalen Hall ) , adding that `` it was his excessive shyness that gained for him a certain notoriety and a place among the early Oxford caricatures . `` In addition to his Oxford positions , he was also an ordained priest in the Church of England .

Russell Shoemaker Ohl ( January 30 , 1898 – March 20 , 1987 ) was an American engineer who is generally recognized for patenting the modern solar cell ( US Patent 2402662 , `` Light sensitive device '' ) .   
 Ohl was a notable semiconductor researcher prior to the invention of the transistor . He was also known as R.S . Ohl .   
 Russell Ohl ’ s specialized area of research was into the behavior of certain types of crystals . He worked on materials research in the 1930s at AT & T 's Bell Labs ’ Holmdel facility , investigating diode detectors suitable for high-frequency wireless , broadcasting , and military radar . His work was only understood by a handful of scientists in the organization , one of whom was Dr. Walter Brattain ( one of the trio who invented the germanium bipolar transistor in 1947 , and who would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1956 ) .   
 Ohl , in 1939 , discovered the PN barrier ( or as it became known , the “ P–N junction ” ) . At the time hardly anyone knew anything about the impurities within these crystals , but Russell Ohl discovered the mechanism by which it worked . It was the impurities which made some sections more resistant to electrical flow than others , and thus it was the `` barrier '' between these areas of different purity that made the crystal work . Ohl later found that super-purifying germanium was the key to making repeatable and usable semiconductor material for diodes . All diodes ( incl . LEDs , laser diodes etc . ) are descendants of Ohl 's work . His work with diodes led him later to develop the first silicon solar cells .

Hendrik Erdenlöf ( 1873-1927 ) was a Norwegian engineer and meteorologist, known for his contributions to crystal science.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 In 1887 he went to Stiging Landnema, some 140 kilometres from Oslo. After a few months in the neighbouring countryside he moved to Lyngby, where he worked as a teacher, professor of engineering, and director of the Polytechnic Institute. Erdenlöf was encouraged by Aivars Mikkelsen, head of the geology department at Lyngby College, to look into the mineral-crystallography method developed in Norway by Jens Hauk.  
 In 1897 he finished his doctorate at the Lyngby College and then worked as an assistant professor of geology there. In 1902 he moved to Norway to work as a professor of meteorology at the Polytechnic Institute of Norway. He also went to work in the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen. He was hired as an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Tartu in 1914.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Erdenlöf focused his studies on the origin of crystal phenomena such as the U-Clarity phenomenon and the symmetry of the M-Cluster. In 1912 he and his Norwegian collaborator, Robert Karlsen ( 1887-1964 ), demonstrated that two crystals create a single one that shows the same basic color.He was a member of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and later the Norwegian Commission of Meteorology.

 = Gwendolen M. Carter =   
Gwendolen Margaret Carter ( 1906–1991 ) was a Canadian-American political scientist . She was one of the founders of African Studies in the United States , past president of the African Studies Association and was among the most widely known scholars of African affairs in the twentieth century .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Carter was born in Hamilton , Ontario ( Canada ) in 1906 . She contracted polio at home as a child , losing the use of her legs for life despite therapy and the care of her physician father . She completed her B.A . degree in history at the University of Toronto in 1929 and received a second B.A . from the University of Oxford in 1931 . At Oxford she served as ceremonial `` Mayoress '' for a day ( her uncle was the Mayor at the time ) and had a photograph taken as a memento ( See image at right ) . She returned to her hometown to teach at McMaster University until 1935 . Carter moved to the United States to undertake graduate study at Radcliffe College , where she completed both an M.A . ( 1936 ) and her Ph.D. ( 1938 ) in political science . Naturalized as an American citizen in 1948 , she taught political science at Smith College from 1943 to 1964 , holding the Sophia Smith chair there from 1961 . She was at Northwestern University from 1964-1974 as Melville J. Herskovits Professor of African Affairs . In 1965 she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . Carter later taught at Indiana University from 1974–1984 and at the University of Florida from 1984 until her retirement in 1987 . Through many years of her professional life , she maintained personal correspondence with leading figures such as Julius Nyerere , Seretse Khama , Gatsha Buthelezi , Steve Biko and Helen Joseph . She was 84 years old when she died at her home in Orange City , Florida on February 20 , 1991 .   
    
    
 == Scholarship ==   
 Carter 's early work focused on European state governance , but her scholarship shifted to Africa after her first trip to South Africa in 1948 , which coincided with the election that brought the Nationalist government to power and introduced Apartheid . From that point on , she focused on the politics and economies of southern Africa during a career that spanned over forty years . Carter 's frequent research trips to South Africa resulted in many publications , several of which have become classics in both political science and African studies . These works , detailing the dynamics of political change in Africa , include :

 = Karl Wilhelms =  
Karl Walther Martin Ludwig Wilhelms ( 10 April 1882 – 19 February 1972 ) was a German neuropathologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Wilhelms was born in Halle aß Eener, Saxony, Germany, the son of a physician who was a native of Lubeck. The university of Halle awarded him a degree of medicine in 1906. He graduated with a PhD under Joseph Goldschmidt in 1905 with an dissertation titled Der ältere folgende Derkugende der Brodhave und die Herrgesteine als die Planisphere im Schweiz und insbesondere der Schneegezte von die ihre Anatomie und der Gebiete der Neurogeschichte, in which he was also the recipient of a letter of recommendation from Josef Hübner.  
 In 1908 he returned to Halle, where in 1910 he became an assistant in a neurological clinic, a position he retained until his retirement in 1941. In 1928 he was named director of the neuropsychiatric institute in Schöneberg.  
 His career spanned several departments, including neurology, neurology and psychiatry, and he continued to work on the anatomical basis of dementia. He was also a psychobiologist who published a number of papers on the relationship of specific personality traits with neuronal processes.  
 He was deeply affected by the institutionalism of the Nazi regime in Germany, and later did not hesitate to express his displeasure with the conduct of medical doctors. Wilhelms described psychiatric illness as `` the poorest form of manhood ''.  
 Wilhelms died in Göttingen in 1972.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
   
   
 === Brain : anatomy, physiology, and pathology ===  
 Wilhelms ’ work concentrated on the anatomical basis of the brain and its connection with the nervous system. He studied the cerebral hemispheres : the ventricles, the pons, and the cerebral cortex.Although Wilhelms was an outspoken critic of pathological psychiatry, such as `` pathological psychology '' ( Poulantz Dasen et al. ), with which he had a professional conflict, he had a very strong affinity for neuropsychiatry. Wilhelms discussed with his student Raymond Wiedemann his views on neuropathology, commenting that “ there can be no disagreement as to the importance of the word neuropathology in the sense of a logical determination of physiological processes. ”  
   
   
 === Neurology ===  
 Wilhelms also discussed neurophysiology, studying ocular corneal reflexes, and superatomy. His laboratory work was devoted to the quantification of oxygen consumption and their association with visual sensitivity. In 1897 he was awarded the Verein für Neurologie und Physiologie zur Allgemeine Physiologie ( for one year ’ s assistance in comparative physiology ).In 1913, in the Autumn semester of this year, Wilhelms demonstrated for the first time that trigeminal nerves produced abnormal phototaxis in the eye, independently of the visual system ( Reich et al. ). In 1916, Wilhelms demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal and lingual nerves caused double vision. In 1918, as part of his practice, Wilhelms also performed neurochemical investigations on urea in the eye.  
   
   
 === Neuropsychology ===  
 Wilhelms contributed to a number of areas of neuropsychology. He completed a comprehensive textbook on motorogy and physiology of the human nervous system in the 1890s, with additional articles in a series of books and monographs on sheep brain. He also wrote a major article in 1894 entitled `` On the structure of the vegetative state, '' published as The Anatomy and Physiology of Consciousness in The New York World-Telegram.  
 Wilhelms coined the phrase `` misreading '' in neurology. He was an outspoken critic of the methodologies used by pathologists in their diagnosis of mental illness, and he viewed the current state of modern neuropsychiatry as having a progressive descent from a belief in innate, irreducible dissection.  
 Wilhelms coined the phrase `` in utero stroke '' in 1910.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 Wilhelms died in Göttingen in 1972, apparently of leukemia.

 = Mikhail Grigoryevich Churkin =  
Mikhail Grigoryevich Churkin ( Russian : Никола́й Приборникович Азбриков ; 20 August 1852, Stalingrad – 26 July 1917, Moscow ) was a Soviet designer and illustrator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 In 1865, Churkin started studying the ancient trade inscriptions in Moscow. His study of Russian inscriptions began the design of several books and magazines, which he made with the help of engravers and assistants, including Pavel August Wilhelm Lopatin. By the time he died in 1917, he had received over 50 works. He is one of the leading figures of the tradition of Russian engraving. A famous landscape in Old Russia, for example, is a work in his style. The unique window on his own bookshop is considered a masterpiece of Russian art and was dedicated to Alexander Nevsky. The window is commemorated with the slogan of his motto.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
   
 Churkin has taken an interest in the meaning of traditional designs and influenced designers in the Soviet Union and abroad. Although he was one of the first to understand the value of designing `` Greek in the design of the world '' ( see Atlantico ), he was not interested in connecting it with what were regarded as frivolous design trends, although there is great importance in the recent fascination with modernism in Russia. He expressed his own desire for an aesthetic harmony between his traditional and the modern.Churkin's main aim was always to bring back the `` Greek idea '', while preserving the purity of the old styles.  
 As a `` modern '' artist, he was influenced by the increasing sophistication of nature and its fine quality of quality of the skin, especially the textile. He always thought about the appearance of the work, thought about color, and wanted to make works using realistic methods, and utilized material minimisation.These sensibilities shaped his views on the values of the masculine and feminine form in visual art. Churkin was conscious of the need to show a distinctive beauty in everyday life, and opposed the ideal of `` a colour palette '' to the kind of `` an all-pervasive, monochrome regime '' which characterized the aesthetic of romanticism. In comparison with the classics of his time, he experimented with creating beautiful typography with minimalistic character - closer to his own and the preferred style of the day.Churkin called for `` harmony between the product and the designer '', and favored minimalism, sensuality and objectivity. His inclination toward the classical orientation is reflected in his influential book Elements of Textile Design ( 1916 ). The book was a necessary preface for the book publications by Art and Architecture and Conceptual Paper with selected drawings and texts of various clients.  
   
   
 == Honors ==  
 Among the many publications by his name is the series The Gardenia or The Heart of Russia ( 1935 ).  
 A couple of sports-game baskets with his artwork were created by the developers of the ENS KVET hockey team.  
 A chandelier made of Churkin's drawings and watercolors is in the ENS collection in Moscow.  
 Several galleries in the Moscow RIAM exhibit His and Hers for the exhibition of Oriental painting on the walls of the exhibition gallery Churkin Gallery.  
 In 1989, UNESCO adopted the international name of `` Churkin '' as a tribute to its authors and designers, and awarded him the `` USSR prize in the history of the arts ''.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Churkin's was an acclaimed figure in modern Russian art. His works from that period are popular with his younger generation, but he is still only an icon of his influence. His publishing works are mostly in the pattern-making and form-making area, and at the time of his death they had an enormous market value. His designs have been used as a reference for very long time.

 = Carl Troll =   
Carl Troll ( 24 December 1899 in Gabersee – 21 July 1975 in Bonn ) , was a German geographer , brother of botanist Wilhelm Troll . From 1919 until 1922 Troll studied biology , chemistry , geology , geography and physics at the Universität in München . In 1921 he obtained his doctorate in botany and in 1925 his habilitation in geography . Between 1922 and 1927 he worked as an assistant at the Geography Institute in Munich . Troll was engaged in research in the ecology and geography of mountainous lands : between 1926 and 1929 went on a research journey throughout South American Andean countries where he visited northern Chile , Bolivia , Peru , Ecuador , Colombia , and Panama . In 1933 and 1934 his research interests took him to East and South Africa ; in 1937 Troll was in Ethiopia ; and in 1954 he visited Mexico .   
 In 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in Berlin , and in 1938 professor of geography in Bonn . Troll , who utilised aerial photographs in his research , coined the term Landscape ecology in 1939 . He developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying aerial photographs interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of Asia , Africa and South America , as well as his native Europe . He developed seasonal climatic charts and three-dimensional climatic classification from hydrological , biological and economical data .   
 Carl Troll was president of the International Geographical Union from 1960 to 1964   
    
    
 == Andean research ==   
 Compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century Troll 's Andean work stands out by being free of developmentalist thought and there is `` no evidence of triumphalism of Western science in his Andean work '' . Vertical zonation is the most acclaimed part of Trolls work in the Andes building upon the work of Alexander von Humboldt .   
    
    
 === The Inca Empire and the environment ===   
 Carl Troll argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the staple food chuño . Chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands . Contradicting the link between the Inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun . Troll did also argue that llamas , the Inca 's pack animal , can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region . It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America . The link between the Andean biomes of puna and páramo , pastoralism and the Inca state is a matter of research . As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building . While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed environmental determinism arguing that culture lied at the core of the Inca civilization .

William Graham McIvor ( 1824 - 8 June 1876 ) was a Scottish gardener and superintendent of the Neilgherry Cinchona plantations in Ootacamund , India who was responsible for the successful introduction of cinchona plants in the Nilgiris in the 1860s .   
    
 McIvor was born in Dollar in Scotland where his father John had settled after working to establish a nursery garden at Crieff . McIvor trained in horticulture and arboriculture and worked at Kew before taking up in 1848 , a position in southern India as superintendent of the yet to be established Ootacamund botanical garden . At Kew , McIvor took an interest in bryophytes and published a pocket herbarium of British hepatics in 1847 . He established the botanical garden at Ootacamund and worked there until his death . He married Anne , eldest daughter of Colonel Edwards of Iscoed , Denbighshire on 31 May 1850 . McIvor received cinchona plants in 1861 that had been brought from South America by Clements Markham . The first set of plants died but later batches consisting of other species ( especially Cinchona succirubra ) did well . McIvor found that removing strips of barks and allowing them to heal by covering them in moss improved the sustainability of harvesting bark from the trees.McIvor ran into troubles with the Madras Government on handling a subordinate who was given to drinking . He also faced labour shortages which were for a while solved by importing Chinese convicts from the Straits Settlements . The labour situation eased in 1877 due to the famine in the plains and an influx into the Niligiris .   
    
 His funeral was attended by most government officers and among those present included Colonel R. H. Beddome.The standard author abbreviation McIvor is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

 = Tom Brown =  
Tom Brown FRSE FRS ( 23 April 1925 – 21 September 1998 ) was a British physical chemist and geneticist who pioneered the use of crystal structure in the elucidation of nucleic acid sequences.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Tom Brown was born in Newgate, Hampshire, the son of Mary Jeanne Brown, a practitioner of vocal femininity and classy singing, and nephew of Alice Olive Read. His father worked as a pharmacist in Surrey and he was then educated at The Women's College, Portsmouth, and James Cook University in Plymouth.  
 After graduating from high school he studied physics at the University of Chicago, under the guidance of John Mackinder, a close friend of Max Born and Paul Broadbent. He earned his PhD in 1945 with his thesis `` A phenomenon involving heterochromatin and crystal structure in the resonance states of radioactive substances ''.He was part of the team of Jack Singleton-Lang, John Mellark and Simon Siddall on a groundbreaking study of polymerase inhibitors. Brown joined the team of Harry Potts as a senior fellow in the University of Cambridge in 1949 and he worked on experiments on polyphenols and the structure of the genes coding for protein nucleic acids. The complex work led to Brown's work on the structure of DNA in 1952. He also collaborated with Thomas Ray Lankester on DNA synthesis, which led to Brown's 1955 book, DNA : its Structure and Function.  
 A year later he completed his PhD with the thesis `` Chlorohydroxylcholine compound : Structure and structure interactions with proteins '', the first report of such studies by anyone.  
 After a brief period of employment at the Cavendish Laboratory he returned to work as a research assistant at Cambridge University in 1957 where he taught for many years, and was appointed a Fulbright Visiting Professor of Genetics and Therapeutics in 1963. From 1966 to 1973 he was Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Würzburg and in 1975 he was named Chairman of the Department of Molecular Biology.  
 He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. From 1977 to 1987 he served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and as Head of the Department of Molecular Biochemistry, now known as the Natural History Museum.  
 He died on 21 September 1998, aged 73. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth Downie ; son Mark Downie, an author of Modern Derivation of Structure ( 1986 ) ; daughter Alexia ( the wife of James Davenport Davenport ), a scientist in the military, and several grandchildren, all of whom went on to important scientific careers ; and a great-grandson who joined the Nuclear Divisions of the Royal Society. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, the actress Elizabeth Mary Stuart ; daughter, Victoria Paula Amy Brown ( b. 1932 ) ; and seven grandchildren.  
 Brown was awarded an honorary doctorate by University of Würzburg in 1991 and honorary doctorates from the University of Sussex ( 1998 ), University of Vienna ( 1997 ), University of Leuven ( 1997 ), University of Sheffield ( 1990 ), the University of Cambridge ( 1990 ), the University of London ( 1990 ), University of East Anglia ( 1989 ), University of Wisconsin ( 1987 ), Pennsylvania State University ( 1986 ), University of Amsterdam ( 1985 ) and the University of Aberdeen ( 1985 ).  
 In 1959, Tom Brown became a Fellow of the Royal Society and continued to be an active member of the society's Research Council. He was elected in 1974 to the University of Cambridge University Union ( UCRU ) and served as Vice-President from 1984 to 1990.

 = Kenneth Sokoloff =   
Kenneth Lee Sokoloff ( July 27 , 1952 – May 21 , 2007 ) was an American economic historian who was broadly interested in the interaction between initial factor endowments , institutions , and economic growth . In particular , he examined the influence of factor endowments on economic development in the New World and the role of 19th century United States patent law in encouraging innovation .   
    
    
 == Career and Personal Life ==   
 Born in Philadelphia , Sokoloff graduated from the American School of Paris in 1970 , earned his bachelor 's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1974 and his doctorate from Harvard University in 1982 where Robert Fogel served as his advisor . He joined the faculty at the University of California , Los Angeles in 1980 where he spent the remainder of his career . He died of liver cancer in Los Angeles , California on May 21 , 2007.Kenneth grew up in Silver Spring Maryland . He had a bone disease that was kept in submission by very expensive medications and transfussions , eventually leading to liver cancer and death . Despite his infirmity , he had an active and full life . His father was a famous scientist , Louis Sokoloff , who did pioneering work in brain metabolism which led to the invention of PET scans .   
    
    
 == Academic Work ==   
 In a series of influential papers coauthored with Stanley Engerman , Sokoloff studied the impact of countries ' initial factor endowments on their later political and economic development . While much of the contemporary literature explained different growth rates across countries by appealing to differences in national culture or religion , Sokoloff used historical data to claim that much of the differential growth experiences of the US colonies and of New World countries can be explained through differences in initial endowments of factors including human capital and levels of inequality . Moreover , Sokoloff and Engerman theorized that initial levels of wealth and political power inequality led to the development of institutions that perpetuated these inequalities , furthering their deleterious impact on long run economic growth . In article `` Institutions , Factors Endowments , and Paths of Development in the New World '' , Sokoloff and Engerman made the specific hypothesis about inequality in wealth , human capital , and political power that restrict development of economics and compose the United States and Canada have developed very different . For example , grains , which is grown on small family farms in the U.S. and Canada that lead the distributions of wealth more equal ; whereas , other colonies in the New World relied on slaves for their labor force that lead to distributions of wealth , human capital and political power very unequal between black ( slaves ) and white . In addition to wealth and political power inequality , they have also mentioned the inequality of schooling in Latin American countries . All of the Latin American countries had literacy requirement for voting . However , the government did not provide funds for public education that caused the Latin Americans to have a low literacy level , in which affected the voting rate . Therefore , a weak organizing schooling institution could affect the development of economy .   
 Sokoloff and his coauthors also sought to understand the relationship between economic institutions and technological innovation . In particular , Sokoloff stressed the importance of US patent institutions in fostering innovation by entrepreneurs . For instance , with Zorina Khan , Sokoloff examined the careers of 160 `` great inventors '' credited with significant technological discoveries during the early American industrialization . In contrast to previous findings , Sokoloff and Khan found that these inventors were active entrepreneurs who responded systematically to market incentives . On the other hand , Sokoloff , with Naomi Lamoreaux , found that over time the capital requirements associated with invention became prohibitively high , leading to firms taking over much of the innovative activity that was previously undertaken by individual entrepreneurs .

Carl George Niemann ( July 6 , 1908 – April 29 , 1964 ) was an American biochemist who worked extensively on the chemistry and structure of proteins , publishing over 260 research papers . He is known , with Max Bergmann , for proposing the Bergmann-Niemann hypothesis that proteins consist of 288 residue polypeptides or multiples thereof with periodic sequences of amino acids , and for contributing to the downfall of the cyclol model of protein structure.Niemann was born in St. Louis and attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison . After completing his Ph.D. in biochemistry there in 1934 and staying on as research associate until 1935 , Niemann took a position at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , where he worked with the eminent protein chemist Max Bergmann . Niemann analyzed the amino acid content of range of proteins . Based on Niemann 's tests and other published protein analyses , Bergmann and Niemann deduced that the sizes of protein molecules are always multiples of 288 and could be expressed according to the formula 2n X 3m . They also suggested that in the polypeptides of a given protein , amino acids occurred in a regular , repeating pattern ; for example , they proposed that silk fibroin , known to consist mainly of glycine and alanine , had a sequence of glycine-alanine-glycine- [ other ] , with the glycine/alanine pattern making up three of every four amino acids and other residues falling periodically into the fourth spot . Niemann worked with Bergmann on this theory from 1936–1938 ; by 1939 , they came to reject the theory as other biochemists provided evidence contradicting their proposed formula.After his work at the Rockefeller Institute and at the University College Hospital as a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow , and with strong support from Warren Weaver , Niemann joined Linus Pauling 's Crellin Laboratory at Caltech in 1938 . In 1939 , Niemann and Linus Pauling published a strong critique of Dorothy Wrinch 's cyclol hypothesis of protein structure , which held that globular proteins formed inter-linked , cage-like polyhedral structures . Niemann and Pauling argued that X-ray crystallography and other data indicated that cyclol bonds did not occur in proteins and that polypeptides were held together in globular proteins by hydrogen bonds and weaker intermolecular forces . He went on to head research in immunochemistry and the organic chemistry of proteins.In 1945 , Niemann became of full professor at Caltech . He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1952 , and was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the New York Academy of Sciences . He died of a heart attack , according to his eulogizer John D. Roberts , `` at the very height of his career '' .

Alfred Einhorn born Alfred Finkle ( 27 February 1856 – 21 March 1917 ) was a Jewish German chemist most notable for first synthesizing procaine in 1905 which he patented under the name Novocain . Until that time the primary anesthetic in use was cocaine , however its undesirable side effects ( including toxicity and addiction ) led scientists to seek out newer anesthetic drugs .   
 Novocain was found to be comparatively safe and effective , although its anesthetic effects were weaker than cocaine and some patients proved highly allergic . However , none of the other anesthetics developed during this period proved more effective and Novocain quickly became the standard local anesthesia . Although its use has largely been replaced by lidocaine , it is still in use today , most frequently in dentistry .

 == Research ==   
 Davis led and conducted major studies of societies in Europe , South America , Africa and Asia , coined the term `` population explosion , '' , and played a major role in the naming and development of the demographic transition model . He was also one of the original scholars in the development of the theory of overurbanization . He is also credited with coining the term `` zero population growth '' although George Stolnitz claimed to have that distinction.Davis had several children while espousing limitations on childbearing worldwide . Davis also published an influential article with Wilbert E. Moore entitled `` Some Principles of Stratification , '' which was a very influential functionalist account of the reasons for social inequality . Davis and Moore synthesize Durkheim and Parsons to argue for the `` functional necessity '' of some positions over others : those that are highest paid go to the most deserving individuals ; at the same time , the differential rewards motivates individuals to work to fill positions they might otherwise not . Thus , from this perspective , illness is a deviant state because it means that the individual may not be able to fill their role . Sociologists see this article as a paradigmatic case of functionalist logic , and indeed , Davis came to be a leading figure in this school of sociology.As a demographer , Davis was internationally recognized for his expertise in world population growth and resources , the history and theory of international migration , world urbanization , demographic transition and population policy .

 = Arthur Tanabe =  
Arthur Tanabe ( 植田 平, Atsuwa, September 13, 1917 – March 19, 1997 ) was a Japanese molecular biologist and selenium researcher known for his work on this compound.Tanabe studied chemistry at the Tokyo Imperial University. In 1928 he began work on selenium gas. He invented a solvent extraction method for the extraction of selenium and improved the technique. After his initial extraction, he isolated `` 疾合重 '', or `` platinum from selenium '', later known as selenium oxide. He is particularly noted for the X-ray emission from selenium, which he produced by using a single piece of aqueous oxygenated ferric chloride solution. His name became associated with this substance in 1937 and since then is known widely as `` Tango ''.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
 Tanabe was born in Niigata to a teacher and a janitor. After a severe illness, he transferred to Niigata University School of Medicine ( now Hosei University ) in 1931, and served as a researcher there from 1930 until 1946. In 1946 he was admitted to a university research group. He began work as a research worker in mass spectrometry in 1946. In 1949 he started teaching at the university in Yokohama, where he became a senior fellow from 1951 to 1955. In 1955, he joined the newly founded Science and Technology Institute at Tokushima, Tokyo. From 1956 to 1963 he was a professor at Hosei University. He retired in 1964 and was awarded the Iwanami Reki Mitsui Prize in 1971.  
 After Tanabe's death in 1997, scientists and researchers who worked in the field were kept up to date with the latest developments in the field, as well as the customary honors and awards given to Tanabe's students.The majority of the work Tanabe worked on was in the field of chemical synthesis. He is the namesake of aseptiform alga belonging to the sea anemone family, which, after a lengthy phase transition, once again became a type of phytoplankton.  
 The identification of the X-ray emission from Tanabe's X-ray diffraction data in the late 1950s sparked interest in the role of X-rays in life. Apart from his work on X-ray emission, Tanabe developed a novel technique for the extraction of selenium and, in 1958, developed a leach-resistant ultraviolet-visible ( LDV ) analyzer that was subsequently used by several large companies worldwide.

Hanoch Albeck ( Hebrew : חנוך אלבק ) ( August 7 , 1890 - January 9 , 1972 ) was a professor of Talmud at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , Israel . He was one of the foremost scholars of the Mishna in his time and he was one of the founders of the scientific approach to the study of the Mishna .   
 Hanoch 's father Shalom Albeck , known as the Talmudic scholar , was the editor of a number of works by   
 Rishonim including Raavan , Meiri on tractate Yevamot , and HaEshkol by Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne . Hanoch studied at the Vienna rabbinical academy and he received rabbinical ordination in 1915 . In 1921 he received a degree from the University of Vienna . Between 1926 and 1936 Albeck taught in the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin . In 1935 he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine where he was immediately appointed as professor and head of the Talmud department at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , a position he held for 25 years .   
 Albeck , who was a religiously observant Jew , published a number of books in Hebrew and German on rabbinical literature , including `` Introduction to the Mishna '' , `` Studies in Baraita and Tosephta '' , `` Introduction to the Talmuds '' , and others . In addition , he published numerous articles in the journal Tarbiz .   
 Professor Albeck also wrote a simple and concise commentary on the Mishna , appending longer footnotes at the ends of each volume . Pinchas Kehati sometimes quotes this work in his own commentary on the Mishna . While the vocalization ( niqqud ) received special attention in Albeck 's edition , the text did not merit such attention , and therefore Albeck 's Mishna is not a fully scientific version of the latter . Albeck 's version was written as a continuation and expansion of the uncompleted earlier work of Hayyim Nahman Bialik .   
 Albeck 's teachers include : David Zvi Miller and Avigdor Optowitzer . His students include : the Talmudic scholar Avraham Goldberg and Abraham Joshua Heschel ( one of the foremost Jewish thinkers in the 20th century ) .   
 Albeck married Hendel Weiss ( the sister of Abraham Weiss ) , and the two had three children . Two of his children are Professor Michael Albeck , a lecturer in organic chemistry , and Professor Shalom Albeck , a lecturer in Jewish law ( and the husband of advocate Pliah Albeck ) , both at Bar Ilan University . His grandson is Amnon Albeck a Professor of Chemistry and University ’ s Vice-Rector at Bar-Ilan University . Albeck 's son in law , Yoseph Aryeh Bachrach , was killed in the Israeli War of Independence in the battle for Jerusalem , leaving behind a wife and two children .   
    
    
 == Awards ==   
 In 1957 it was announced that Albeck was to receive the Israel prize ; however , as a matter of principle Albeck refused to accept the award .   
 In 1959 Albeck was elected as a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities .   
 In 1969 Albeck was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought .

Prof Nicholas Kemmer , FRS FRSE ( 7 December 1911 – 21 October 1998 ) , was a Russian-born nuclear physicist working in Britain , who played an integral and leading edge role in United Kingdom 's nuclear programme , and was known as a mentor of Abdus Salam – a Nobel laureate in physics .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
    
 === Early life ===   
 He was the son of Nicholas P. Kemmer and his wife , Barbara Statzer , and was born in Saint Petersburg , his family moved to Germany in 1922 , where he was educated at Bismarckschule Hanover and then at the University of Göttingen . He received his doctorate in nuclear physics at the University of Zurich and worked as an assistant to Wolfgang Pauli , who had to give strong arguments in 1936 , before being allowed to employ a non-Swiss national . Later on , Kemmer moved to the Beit Fellowship at Imperial College London .   
    
    
 === British nuclear development ===   
 He moved to Trinity College , Cambridge in 1940 to work on Tube Alloys , the wartime atomic energy project . In 1940 , when Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather showed that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would in theory produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product , Kemmer ( who was lodging at the Bretschers ' ) proposed the names Neptunium for the new element 93 and Plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus ( uranium being element 92 ) . The Americans Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , who had made the same discovery , fortuitously suggested the same names .   
    
    
 === Professorship ===   
 He spent 1944–1946 in Canada . At the University of Edinburgh from 1953 to 1979 , he was Tait Professor of Mathematical Physics , creating the Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics in 1955 . He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1954 . His proposers were Norman Feather , Max Born , Sir Edmund Whittaker and Alexander Aitken . He served as the Society 's Vice-President from 1971 to 1974.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1956 and won its Hughes Medal in 1966 . Kemmer was awarded the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1975 . Nicholas Kemmer was also a mentor and a teacher of the only Pakistani Nobel laureate , Dr. Abdus Salam . Kemmer is credited to trained and work with Salam in Neutron scattering by using relativity equations . Salam later passed his research work to Pakistani physics students who went on to contribute in this field .

 === Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation ===   
 The Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation ( DKP equation , also called Duffin–Kemmer equation or Kemmer equation ) plays a role in the description of the standard model of particles , together with the Yang-Mills field . The Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation is closely linked to the Proca equation and the Klein–Gordon equation . The DKP equation suffers the same drawback as the Klein–Gordon equation in that it calls for negative probabilities . The equation involves matrices which obey the Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebra . The work leading to the DKP equation , culminating in Kemmer 's article , has been quoted as `` the first attempt at writing down a satisfactory relativistic theory of elementary particles beyond the electron '' , and these equations have later been brought in unified form with the Dirac equation by Homi J. Bhabha .

François Louis Doll ( 12 April 1858 – 1 December 1939 ) was a French geologist and biologist.  
 Born in Tours, he studied chemistry at the Conservatoire de Paris and began studying biology at the École Normale Supérieure in 1879. During his studies, he developed a mineral crystallography technique. He was one of the first to isolate calcite, an element rich in magnesium and calcium, as a marker of fossils of early birds. He investigated the structure of the Cr C3 system of fossilized reptiles.  
 During the First World War, Doll served as a Lieutenant in the French Forces of the R.A. Vaucluse.  
 Doll made several important geological discoveries :  
   
 Alluvial deposits in the Provinces of Alsace, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Peradeniya, and Flanders.  
 Calcite, an early derivative of quartz.  
 The fossil elements not in its mineralogy, namely gypsum, calcium sulfate, and nickel.  
 The evidence for erosion of granitic deposits near the tip of the Earth.  
 Evidence for the flow of water ( Pliocene ) in the Alps.  
 The melting of monzonite, an igneous rock.  
 The structure of pufferite and corrugated iron.  
 Evidence for glaciation in areas with oceans.  
 Epipothere, the oldest volcanic rock, but at the tip of the Earth.  
 Prehistoric lignite, carbon and potassium.  
 The abrupt termination of the Younger Dryas with the Younger Triassic.  
 The Jurassic Peninsular–Triassic transition from the Late Miocene to the Jurassic.  
 His many achievements were broadened by the industrial development that resulted from the war.  
 Doll's interests were widened by the work of physicist César Franck.  
 He died of heart failure at his family home in Heiswick, Yorkshire.

 Skinner was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Leonard Arthur ( b. 1908 ) and Joice C. Skinner. He studied psychology at UCLA where he was involved in the study of sexual development, earning an AB in 1951. He obtained an MA in 1954, and an MS in 1958 from the University of California, Los Angeles. He became a full professor in the Department of Psychoanalysis at UCLA in 1969.  
 In 1968 he received a Nobel Prize in Medicine and Literature ( Nobel Peace Prize ).  
   
   
 == Contributions ==  
 He studied childhood personalities and later relationships. In his essays, some of which appear in The Clinical Journal of Adult Development and between the Erotic and the Symbolic, he explores psychoanalysis's work as a `` black art '' that can be studied and a path to understanding when someone wants to become `` male or female ''. He said, `` Even children, young or old, who do not want to be children at all... can indeed be trained to identify as boys or girls, and remain so.... The problem is always to recognize this as a clinical reality and then devise effective ways to change that young person's relationships so that he or she can be one with the mother and father, and with all children, which can be done in a very brief, peaceful, loving and rewarding way ''.

 = Guidobaldo del Monte =   
Guidobaldo del Monte ( 11 January 1545 – 6 January 1607 , var . Guidobaldi or Guido Baldi ) , Marquis del Monte , was an Italian mathematician , philosopher and astronomer of the 16th century .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Del Monte was born in Pesaro . His father , Ranieri , was from a leading wealthy family in Urbino . Ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture . The Duke of Urbino , Duke Guidobaldo II , honoured him with the title Marchese del Monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before Guidobaldo . On the death of his father Guidobaldo inherited the title of Marchese .   
 Guidobaldo studied mathematics at the University of Padua in 1564 . While there he became a friend of the great Italian poet Torquato Tasso . In fact Guidobaldo may have known Tasso before they studied at Padua together , for Tasso was almost exactly the same age as Guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the Duke of Urbino , with the duke 's son , from 1556 .   
 Guidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in Hungary between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire . After serving in the army , Guidobaldo returned to his estate of ( Monte Baroccio ) Mombaroccio in the Marche , where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics , mechanics , astronomy and optics . He studied mathematics under Federico Commandino during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples . He also became a friend of Bernardino Baldi , who was also a student of Commandino around the same time .   
 He corresponded with several mathematicians including Giacomo Contarini , Francesco Barozzi and Galileo Galilei . His invention of a drafting instrument for constructing regular polygons and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of Galileo 's geometric and military compass .   
 Guidobaldo was also important in helping Galileo Galilei in his academic career . Galileo , then a promising , but unemployed 26-year-old , had written an essay on hydrostatic balance , which struck Guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius . He then commended Galileo to his brother , the Cardinal Del Monte , who referred him to the powerful Duke of Tuscany , Ferdinando I de ' Medici . Under his patronage , Galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the University of Pisa , in 1589 . Guidobaldo became a staunch friend of Galileo and helped him again in 1592 , when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua , due to the hatred and machinations of Giovanni de ' Medici , a son of Cosimo I de ' Medici , against Galileo . Notwithstanding their friendship , Guidobaldo was a critic of Galileo 's principle of the isochronicity of the pendulum , a major discovery which Guidobaldo thought was impossible .   
 Guidobaldo wrote an influential book about perspective , titled Perspectivae Libri VI , published at Pesaro in 1600 . Several painters , architects and the theater stage designer Nicola Sabbatini used this geometrical knowledge in their works .   
 He died at Mombaroccio in 1607 .

John Machlin Buchanan ( September 29 , 1917 – June 25 , 2007 ) was an American professor of biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . He arrived at MIT in 1953 and retired in 1988 after a distinguished career in which he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences . He played a key role in the development of MIT 's Department of Biology as a major force in biochemistry research and was himself a prominent researcher of purine biosynthesis . He died in 2007 at age 89 .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 Buchanan was born in Winamac , Indiana in 1917 . He became interested in a career in science during a high school chemistry course . He attended DePauw University as an undergraduate , where he gained his first scientific research experience , and from which he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry in 1938 . He received his M.S . from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor in 1939 , and later identified the head of its chemistry department , Howard B. Lewis , as a key influence in his research career . Buchanan received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1943 under the supervision of Albert Baird Hastings .   
    
    
 == Academic career ==   
 Buchanan arrived at MIT in 1953 after reaching the rank of full professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School . He had been heavily recruited by the head of what was then called the Department of Molecular Biology , Francis O. Schmitt . He became the head of the Division of Biochemistry and quickly began recruiting faculty interested in biochemistry research , including Gene Brown , Vernon Ingram , Salvador Luria , Paul Schimmel , Phil Robbins and Lisa Steiner ( the first woman faculty member in the department , hired in 1967 ) . He also sought out more senior scientists to bring to MIT , including Cyrus Levinthal , Maurice Fox and Alexander Rich . James Killian , the MIT president responsible for recruiting Buchanan , described the hire as among the most important and expensive hires he made , because the department 's biochemistry division under Buchanan 's leadership quickly became widely well-regarded in the field . Later , as biochemistry became more established , Buchanan opposed some of the decisions made in the department , such as the shutdown of the Division of Biochemistry under department head Boris Magasanik and the planning under subsequent department head Gene Brown to launch the Whitehead Institute.Buchanan was awarded the Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry in 1951 . He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953 and to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1962 . Buchanan became the first John and Dorothy Wilson Professor in 1966 and retained the title till he retired in 1988 . In 2006 , MIT endowed an annual lectureship in his name .   
    
    
 == Research ==   
 Buchanan 's graduate research formed one of the earliest uses of radiolabeling for studying metabolism . He is best known for his research on the biosynthesis of purines . Often working in parallel with G. Robert Greenberg , Buchanan 's research group made so much progress on this topic that they laid out their findings in a series of over 20 papers published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry . Buchanan and Greenberg 's work together provided an understanding of the pathway through which purine bases could be converted to nucleotides .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Buchanan met his wife Elsa during a visit to Stockholm to work with Hugo Theorell . The two were married for 57 years and had four children . Buchanan died in 2007 at age 89 .

Henry Charles Nolan ( March 25, 1836 – February 7, 1918 ) was an American astronomer. His name is sometimes attributed to Henry Charles Garrett Nolan, an early student of Dante Alighieri. In contrast to Garrett Nolan's progressive views, Nolan supported racial tolerance.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Henry Charles Nolan was born in New Haven, Connecticut on March 25, 1836, the son of a Methodist pastor. While a child, he attended Yale and continued at Yale University, where he received an education in mathematics and physics. While attending Yale, he corresponded with, and corresponded with, prominent artists including Alexander Calder, Blake, and Gifford Pinchot.He began his scientific career at Yale, where he received his doctorate in meteorology in 1850. He held a position at the Wesleyan Observatory in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1850, and served in that post until 1852.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 In 1854, Nolan was the author of `` The Astronomical Habits of British Birds '' ( edited by Richard Arthur Wood ). In the same year, he delivered a lecture to the Virginia Academy of Sciences on `` First Principles in Geometrical Astronomy ''. His paper, `` On the Present Position of the Sun in Solar Numerical Tables '', was reprinted in the Proceedings of the Virginia Academy of Sciences in 1856. His treatise on the classification of the `` local motion '', `` The Calculation of the Earth's Distances '', was in 1857 the starting point of speculation on the basis of two ten-year runs.  
 In 1861, Nolan was elected as an adjunct professor of meteorology and astronomy at Boston College, where he remained until his death in 1918. He lectured at Wesleyan in New York City from 1864 to 1868, and New York University in 1865–1867. He was the author of a second edition of his work on celestial mechanics and variations and problems in harmony.  
 His major work, published posthumously, is `` A Select Atlas of Universal and Celestial Motion '' ( 1878 ), which incorporates some of Nolan's original observations and computations as it pertained to local and local variations of the Sun's position. In it, Nolan describes the aspects of celestial motion discussed in the Introduction to `` The Elements of the Physical Theory of Celestial Motion, '' both general and local. The introduction states that `` Young and technical readers may desire to improve upon, as far as possible, the Principles of This Illustrious Work by the addition of the following valuable notes. To obtain an idea of the extent and urgency of the novelty... I have left in the revised edition the propositions originally advanced in the Preface... ''

 = Johann Wydrausch =  
Johann Friedrich Georg Wydrausch ( 21 December 1765 – 11 September 1833 ) was a German physician and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wydrausch was born in Zürich, and the son of Johann Philipp Wydrausch, a lawyer and member of the city's chamber of commerce, and his wife Carola Sophia, née Schindler. In 1791, he entered the medical faculty at the University of Halle, and during the following four years spent several years in order to study the healing properties of wild plants. While still at Halle, he became a member of the Academy of Botany, in 1802 and 1807.  
 In 1801, Wydrausch entered the service of the Northumbrian Company, as a vice-consul in Copenhagen, and was there for some time in the following years. From 1801 until his death, he was Professor of Botany and Entomology at the University of Berlin ( 1808-1813 ).  
 In 1817, Wydrausch was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences by King George V. He was also President of the Royal Swedish Society of Sciences from 1819 until his death.  
 The genus Wydrauschia, named after Wydrausch, was named in his honor by Dr. Axel Housberg, in 1837. The species Wydrauschia pacificum ( 1889 ) was named by Dr. Louis Ricaud, in 1856.  
 He contributed more than 40 new species to the scientific literature, and is considered the first to include both taxa from India and Africa as well as the English and the Dutch amongst his taxa.  
 He made numerous observations of natural history in the New World, notably on honeybees, and conducted the first successful aerial survey of native plants in China. He also made collecting trips to the Philippines, and identified the plants which are now endemic in the islands.  
 In 1889, he gave a course of natural history lectures in Berlin, to the students of Martin Ritson at the University of Leipzig, and the same year, from 1801 to 1807, he served as president of the Society of South African Naturalists.

 = Moritz Ludwig Frankenheim =   
Moritz Ludwig Frankenheim ( June 29 , 1801 – January 14 , 1869 ) was a German physicist , geographer , and crystallographer .   
    
    
 == Life and education ==   
 Moritz Ludwig Frankenheim was born in 1801 in Brunswick . His family was Jewish . He attended the Gymnasium ( high school ) there and in Wolfenbüttel . Afterwards he went to Berlin to attend the Alma Mater Berolinensis ( today Humboldt University of Berlin ) to study physics . In 1823 he completed a dissertation titled Dissertatio de Theoria Gasorum et Vaporum Meditationes ( `` Contemplations on the scientific theory of gases and vapors '' ) . Inspired by the research of his teacher Christian Samuel Weiss ( 1780-1856 ) , he became interested in crystallography . In 1827 he moved to the University of Breslau , where he was assistant professor of physics , geography , and mathematics from 1827 to 1850 . In 1850 he was promoted to the position of professor of these subjects . After his retirement , he first moved to Leipzig and then to Dresden , where he died in 1869 at the age of 67 .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Frankenheim 's focus of research was crystallography , particularly studies of crystal structure and the mathematical and theoretical basis of the symmetry of crystals . By 1826 , he was already using the integer reciprocals of Weiss ' coefficients ( the intersection of a plane with the three crystallographic axes ) to describe the spatial positions of crystal surfaces , from which the British crystallographer William Hallowes Miller ( 1801-1880 ) developed the concept of Miller indices in 1839 . By assigning symmetry elements to the crystal systems defined previously by Weiss and Friedrich Mohs ( 1773-1839 ) , Frankenheim was able , for the first time , to define 32 point groups ( crystal classes ) and to classify them into four crystal systems ( the regular one , the fourfold , the twofold and the sixfold ) . From his observations he derived 15 lattice types for crystals , which were later reduced by Auguste Bravais ( 1811-1863 ) to 14 and today as Bravais lattices describe unit cells of crystal structures . Frankenheim conducted one of the first microscopic examinations of crystals in polarized light , using the then-new Nicol prism as a polarizer .   
 In the field of geography , his most famous work is his book Völkerkunde ( `` Ethnology '' ) , published in 1852 .

 == Biography ==   
 Aukrust was born in the parish of Lom in Oppland , Norway . He was raised in the traditional region of Gudbrandsdal . His parents Olav Olavsson Aukrust ( 1851–1931 ) and Mari Pålsdatter Andvord ( 1864–1936 ) were farmers on the Nordgard Aukrust farm in the valley of Bøverdalen . His brother Lars Olsen Aukrust ( 1886–1965 ) was a teacher and local official . His nephews Odd Aukrust ( 1915 –2008 ) was an economist and Kjell Aukrust ( 1920–2002 ) was an author , poet and artist.Aukrust was a student of the folk college at Romundgard in Sel operated by priest and educator Christopher Bruun ( 1839–1920 ) . From 1915 to 1917 , he worked as a teacher at the folk high school at Dovre where future novelist Ingeborg Møller ( 1878–1964 ) was also a teacher . He later taught at Gausdal.In 1911 , he married Gudrun Blekastad ( 1887–1984 ) , daughter of Haugean businessman Ivar Blekastad ( 1850–1936 ) . She was the sister of artist Hallvard Blekastad ( 1883–1966 ) and sister-in-law of literary historian Milada Blekastad ( 1917–2003 ) .He was strongly influenced by priest and author Ivar Mortensson-Egnund ( 1857–1934 ) who advocate of the use of Nynorsk . Aukrust wrote poems with a renewed national romantic style and used a characteristically similar form . His use of rural dialect contributed to the growth of Nynorsk as a literary language.Olav Aukrust joined the Anthroposophical Society in December 1921 after he and his wife , Gudrun Aukrust , traveled through Goetheanum on their way home from Italy . He suffered from tuberculosis , which came to characterize his last year and led to an early death at age 46 .

 = Herbert Smuts =  
Herbert Smuts ( November 2, 1902 – January 6, 1967 ) was an American plant physiologist. He was a pioneer in the field of plant physiology and the subsequent study of traits of flowering plants. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Distinguished Service Award in 1934, and in 1940 he was awarded the Ivar Laakson Award of the International Society for Phytogeography and Botany. Smuts studied at Cornell University, where he was one of the leaders of the Department of Botany.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Smuts was born on November 2, 1902, in Auburn, Michigan, the son of Gustave W. Smuts and Mary Anne DeLand. He attended Smith College, graduating summa cum laude in 1923, but soon began research at the request of the college's botanist, Ralph Eaton.In 1926, Smuts moved to Washington, D.C. where he remained until 1930. There, he researched and conducted pioneering research on the physiology of leaf development. His interest in the physiology of flowers led to his work with William C. McCarthy. The relationship between his research and the study of female plants led to the creation of the Marvin Smuts Ornithology Laboratory at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Throughout his career, Smuts worked with many notable plant physiologists, including Richard J. Pollak, Tom Tholey, J. Robert Thurber, Leonard Harmon, Harold H. King, and Jack Bland. Smuts became the head of the Plant Physiology Department at the University of California, Berkeley.  
 In 1955, he became a Distinguished Service Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained until his death. As an academic, he has been praised for his development of foundational research in the fields of physiology and the study of flowering plants. He had numerous scientific publications published during his career, including many papers published in the Annals of Botany, the American Journal of Botany, the Botanical Papers, and the Journal of Phytogeography.  
   
   
 == Selected writings ==  
 Based on the work of Ruth Burdon and Edgar Mitchell, he made contributions in the following fields :  
   
 When I crossed the world with my four-inch ( 10-cm ) long brush, Dorothy Whitcomb Gordon wrote of him :  
 [ E ]ach moment of color blurring did his world shrink, not only to a pleasure-cost estimate, but also to a total one-dimensional perspective.  
   
 Smuts published the first two papers related to a widespread `` Long-ornate '' cabbage. In that paper, Smuts reported the study of the morphological characteristics of the loess of California, emphasizing the similarities in the leaves and fur of the cultivated and wild varieties. An earlier paper by him and Mark E. Michelson on leaf development from the New Jersey Ironworkers'Cattle series suggested a structure in the leaves and the leaf veins that accounted for the appearance of the different loess forms. In the second paper, Smuts described the pattern in spring ( May–June ) in China and India of leaf veins forming before the leaves even form.Smouts found evidence of root-cap acorns in some North American species. He and Walter Brainerd found the genus Acacia as well. Along with Paul M. Albrecht, Heinemann, and L. S. Mark, he co-authored the book Annotated Plants of Northern Mexico, a valuable reference book in botany.

 = Louis Agas =  
Louis Agas ( c.1590, Risolu, Nijmegen – 1621, Delft ) was a Dutch Jesuit and naturalist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was the brother of Reinhold Agas. He was born in Rouen on 4 September 1590, the son of Conrad Agas ( 1560–1621 ), a minister, and Magdalen Anne Maatheleen Maria Gautier ( 1574–1656 ). His brother became the Provincial of Delft in 1586, where he settled until his death. Louis Agas was the younger brother of Reinhold Agas and was named its successor as deputy chaplain in the Jansenist Dutch Province of Zerbst as well as the Protestant and some Calvinist ministers who lived in the area. Reinhold died on 13 March 1604. Louis, who was then eight years old, died at the age of nineteen in the house of the pastor, Count Dostercko. He had been married in 1599 to Magdalen Beelden, an amateur astronomer who had little knowledge of astronomy. After the death of the father, Magdalen produced his son Ferdinand Agas and appointed him to succeed the elder Agas in Delft. The name Agas was introduced by John Cannans ( 13th century, Dutch East India Company ), and was adopted by Protestants around the world.  
 After moving to Delft, Louis contracted apoplexy in 1600 and died on 27 July 1621.  
 He left his vast knowledge and his valuable collections of minerals, plants, and other antiquities to the University of Delft, and was also the instigator of the first systematic theology courses. Agas is commemorated in the scientific names of several organisms, including a genus of bacteria, Coccidura agasicus, named in his honour.  
 He is known for his assistance with the establishment of a canal in Delft, near Vondelampen, about 1400-1300 A.D. This was named the Louis Agas Canal.

Henri Guillemin ( 1821-1891 ) was a French educator, pioneer of linguistics and author of the famous general textbook Neue Blutwertigung der Jesu ( `` A Manual of the Catholic Religion '' ).  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Guillemin was born in Mignanouille in the Province of Champagne. His father, François Guillemin ( 1807–1860 ), was a Master ( bacteriologist ) at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Henri's father was a teacher at Notre Dame, from whom Guillemin was also sent. Henri's mother was Marie Rivier ( 1817–1877 ).  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 Henri received his first instruction in classics from his father when he was seven years old. He went on to study at the Sorbonne, being subsequently admitted to the Musée du Rocher and the Comte de Mont-Blanc College.  
 In 1849 Guillemin obtained a law degree.  
 In 1859 he founded the Gymnasium du rocherie ( `` College of College of West Amiens '' ) with an opening in Ghent. He has also been involved in educational and literary activity throughout the region.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1853 Guillemin published the first edition of his `` Philosophie de l'éducation '' which, with his `` Comte des méthodes ; de l'éducation '', formed the basis of the Primitivism. In this work Guillemin criticizes the 'imaginative'logic, the 'rationalist'behavior of the public schools and the 'actionism'of the public life.  
 Guillemin's book, published in 1859, was reprinted many times, including a fourth edition and new editions with much expanded contents. He used the pages for discourse and essays.  
 In 1881 Guillemin's `` Comte de Montblanc général '', `` Father le rocher '', `` neige blutwertige Blutwertige '' and `` Neue Blutwertigung der Jesu '' became internationally renowned. He was a fellow of the Académie des Sciences ( 1850 ) and wrote for the Le Sage, Le Chiffre, Lausanne and Le Scala. Guillemin died in Ghent, Belgium.

 == Life ==   
 Joseph Henry Thayer was born in 1828 in Boston . He graduated from Harvard in 1850 and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1857 . From 1858 to 1864 he served as a pastor—first in Quincy , Massachusetts , then in Salem—and served as a chaplain of the 4oth Massachusetts Volunteers in the American Civil War . After the war , he returned to Massachusetts to become Professor of Sacred Literature at Andover Theological Seminary , where he taught until 1882 . In 1884 , he began teaching New Testament criticism at Harvard . In 1870 , Thayer was a member of the American Bible Revision Committee and recording secretary of the New Testament company ( working on the Revised Version ) . Thayer 's Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament is one of the greatest achievements in biblical scholarship at the turn of the twentieth century . As the culmination of nearly three decades of work , more than 5,000 entries , references to grammatical and exegetical works , detailed etymology , and complete summaries of both biblical and extra-biblical word usage . Thayer 's Greek–English Lexicon published in 1889 represents a watershed event in nineteenth-century Greek lexicography . Thayer 's Greek–English Lexicon is a revised and translated edition of C.G . Wilke 's Clavis Novi Testamenti - first published in 1841 . After numerous revisions by both Wilke and his successor , C.L . Wilibald Grimm , Thayer took over the project . Thayer devoted nearly thirty years to the translation that first appeared in 1885 , and updated edition in 1889 . In February 1891 Thayer published a lecture in which he expressed disagreement with the position of Biblical inerrancy , asserting that his own acceptance of various errors of history and science in the Bible did not materially detract from his belief in the overall soundness of Christianity.Thayer was president of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis for 1894 and 1895 . In his 1895 presidential address , he called for the creation of an `` American School for Oriental Study and Research '' in Palestine .   
 Over the next five years , the Society was involved in the establishment of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem . A plaque commemorating Thayer 's role in its foundation was placed at the American School in 1933 .

Robert Durrer ( 1890–1978 ) was a Swiss engineer who developed the basic oxygen steelmaking process ( the Linz-Donawitz process , named after the towns where the technology was commercialized ) . The process was successfully tested by Durrer in 1948 . A team led by Dr Theodor Eduard Suess in Austria adapted the process and scaled it to industrial size , and it was commercialized by VÖEST and ÖAMG.Durrer graduated from the Royal Technical University of Aachen in 1915 . He stayed in Germany and in 1928 accepted the chair of the Professor of Metallurgy at the Technical University of Berlin . From 1933 to 1939 , during his time in Nazi Germany , Durrer supervised experiments on the new steel making technique . In 1943 Durrer returned from Nazi Germany to Switzerland and was appointed to the board of von Roll AG , the country 's largest steelmaker . Durrer teamed up with Heinrich Heilbrugge and ran a series of experiments that established commercial viability of basic oxygen metallurgy . In 1947 Durrer ordered a small experimental converter from the United States , and on 1 April 1948 Durrer and Heilbrugge produced their first oxygen-blown steel.In the summer of 1948 von Roll AG and two Austrian state-owned companies , VÖEST and ÖAMG , agreed to commercialize the Durrer process . Their commercial converter furnaces were put into operation in November 1952 ( VÖEST in Linz ) and May 1953 ( ÖAMG , Donawitz ) and temporarily became the leading edge of the world 's steelmaking , causing a surge in steel-related research . Unlike Europe , whose industrial capacity had been decimated by World War II , America had a large base of steelmaking capacity , and it was economic to retain , rather than replace , its capital stock . U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel nonetheless introduced oxygen steelmaking in 1964 ; by 1969 , its tonnage surpassed that manufactured using the Bessemer process . Japan became an early adopter and by 1970 produced 80 % of its steel in Linz-Donawitz furnaces . Durrer 's contribution to practical steelmaking was marked by the AIME Benjamin F. Fairless Award , 1966. etc .   
 Durrer was a Professor at ETH Zurich from 1943 to 1961 . He edited and co-authored the multi-volume Metallurgie des Eisens ( Metallurgy of Iron , or the `` Gmelin-Durrer '' ) . The annual Staudinger-Durrer Prize awarded by ETH Zurich commemorates Durrer along with Nobel Prize winner Hermann Staudinger .

 == Biography ==  
 Masare Kajimura was born on March 4, 1863, in the town of Haruo in Shizuoka Prefecture. His father, Masanobu Kajimura, was the director of the Shizuoka Imperial Imperial Museum. His mother was teacher Misawa. He started elementary school at the age of 6. During his education, he became a regular pupil of Iwatani Moriko ( 1855-1910 ) and one of the few girls among the many students of Moriko.  
 When Moriko, who had also taken classes under Iwatani, died in 1894, the following year, she provided the inheritance to Masare. After studying history and foreign languages at the University of Tokyo from 1905 to 1906, he received a degree in Oriental languages and culture in 1907 from the University of Tokyo, where he later received a doctorate in the same year.During this time, Masare was researching the distribution of the red toad Darcochelys bicolor at Daegu. Because of his association with Moriko, as well as the fact that he is also a descendant of Murakami himself, he was granted honorary citizenship by the Kingdom of Japan in 1910, the same year as the 100th anniversary of the death of Murakami. He obtained his second official citizenship in the year 1913.  
 Because of his newfound position at the Imperial Museum, he began to teach native language classes in Japanese. In 1916, he married the English-speaking Helen Lorraine Hall, daughter of historian Thomas Hall.  
 He was a student of Masunaga Keitarō ( 1836-1912 ), and made Japanese trips to China to see and investigate the composition and evolution of the yan yan trees. He also became a student of Vohda Takao ( 1855-1910 ) and Adolf Leibniz ( 1859-1912 ). During his career, he made about 70 trips to Korea. In 1927, he was appointed director of the Museum and started working there as the Museum's director. In 1927, he founded a course in Japanese history with Osuki Manako.

 = Ignazio Cerio =   
Ignazio Cerio ( 1841 – 1921 ) was an influential but eccentric physician and amateur philosopher on the island of Capri , in Italy . His father , imprisoned for his liberal beliefs , had spent his time in jail devising chemical concoctions and mechanical constructions that would never be made ; Ignazio continued the family traditions of both liberalism and idiosyncratic inventiveness . Ignazio even coined the word disutilità to refer to a human life lacking a sense of purpose but full of tension and reflection , mixing passionate pursuit of ideas with periods of lovesickness and ennui .   
 He worked for fifty years as a medical doctor on Capri , a profession he followed with his characteristically unconventional flair . On one occasion , for example , he established a sanitorium at Pozzuoli , claiming that the sulphurous gases would cure tuberculosis . The only patient to arrive at the sanitorium rejected the doctor 's contention that both sulphur and arsenic would be good for the health .   
 Nevertheless , he remains a well-remembered and much-loved figure on the island of Capri , his memory immortalised both in the writings of his son , Edwin Cerio ( particularly in La vita a la figura de un uomo ( 1921 ) ) and in the cultural Centro Caprense Ignazio Cerio , established in his name to organise conferences and meetings on medicine , Italian and foreign literature , archaeology , palaeontology , and international and local history .   
 Palazzo Cerio , close to the Piazzetta , hosts the Ignazio Cerio museum about Capri 's natural history .

Werner Braunbeck ( German : Werner Braunbek ; 8 January 1901 – 9 February 1977 ) was a German physicist.He was born in Bautzen , the son of the Government Commissioner of City Planning Otto August Braunbek ( 1869–1929 ) . Werner attended the University of Stuttgart , the University of Munich and the University of Berlin . In 1925 he received a doctorate in engineering and completed his habilitation in theoretical physics the following year at the University of Stuttgart , where he continued as a lecturer .   
 In 1932 Braunbeck became Associate Professor at the University of Stuttgart , before replacing Alfred Landé in 1936 as Professor of theoretical physics at the University of Tübingen , and succeeding to the role of Professor in 1959 . In 1961/62 he served as Dean of Mathematical and Natural Sciences of the University of Tübingen .   
 In 1934 Braunbeck developed the Braunbek coil , a modified Helmholtz coil . In 1939 , he disproved Earnshaw 's theorem by showing that there are magnetic fields in which small diamagnetic bodies can float in a stable position . He pioneered study into the diffraction of waves , particularly at short wavelengths . Braunbek also authored a number of popular science physics books .   
 He died in Tübingen , aged 76 .

 = Eugene L. Clarke =  
Eugene Maxwell Clarke ( February 19, 1913 – October 17, 1992 ) was an American physicist, known for his work on neutrons and electroweak nuclear forces, which influenced classical and quantum mechanics. He made his first observation of the collision of pairs of particles with ordinary matter using fermions. He also examined how matter interacts with matter to form new particles. In 1937, Clarke obtained one of the first models of an elementary particle–antiparticle duality, the Tevatron, which he then used to show that elementary particles also interact with matter. He then observed that neutrons, one of the fundamental particles of matter, travel through matter using the electron's momentum. He then used Tevatron experiments to use electrons to distinguish between different kinds of matter, showing that electrons travel in both protons and muons, together with positrons and neutrons. He and his friend Ernest Lawrence developed the equivalent concepts for electromagnetic radiation and X-ray radiation. At Lawrence's suggestion, they developed two-particle models of X-ray and radioactivity.Clarke was a recipient of the Cooper Medal and the King Prize in Physics and awarded the award of the Independence Medal and Medal of Freedom. He was the Chair of Physics at Columbia University from 1973 to 1978. The University awarded him the John von Neumann Award, the Croonian Medal, and the Hoover Medal for Distinguished Service to Science.He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Physics.After his death, a crater in the crater of Cherenkov discovered in 1970 is named after him.The Einstein Prize for Physicists is named in his honor.

 = John L. Horn =   
John Leonard Horn ( September 7 , 1928 – August 18 , 2006 ) was a scholar , cognitive psychologist and a pioneer in developing theories of multiple intelligence .   
 The structure of mental abilities   
 For his PhD research at the University of Illinois , Horn identified other broad intellectual abilities to supplement fluid reasoning ability ( gf ) and crystalised ability ( gc ) postulated by his supervisor Raymond Cattell . As with Cattell , Horn rejected the existence of an even higher level factor of general intelligence ‘ g ’ asserted by Spearman ( 1927 ) . In Horn ( 1988 ) he reported a full list of such broad level abilities :   
 gc ( crystalised )   
 gf ( fluid )   
 gv ( visual )   
 ga ( auditory )   
 gq ( quantitative )   
 gs ( processing speed )   
 TSR ( Long-term storage and retrieval )   
 SAR ( Short-term acquisition and retrieval )   
 The Cattell-Horn model was , more or less , replicated by Carroll ’ s ( 1993 ) massive analysis by of 450+ intelligence measures , which also yielded a higher order factor similar to Spearman ’ s ‘ g ’ . McGrew ( 2005 ) reported that in 1999 the test publisher ‘ Riverside Publishing met with Horn and Carroll privately in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , to seek a common , more meaningful umbrella term that would recognise the strong structural similarities of their respective theoretical models , yet also recognize their differences . This sequence of conversations resulted in a verbal agreement that the phrase “ Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of cognitive abilities ” made significant practical sense , and appropriately recognized the historical order of scholarly contribution of the three primary contributors . ’   
 The Cattell-Horn- Carroll ( CHC ) theory is the basis for many modern IQ tests . Horn 's parallel analysis , a method for determining the number of factors to keep in an exploratory factor analysis , is also named after him .

Murzynowski came from a Polish noble family of the Ogończyk coat of arms.Murzynowski studied at a gymnasium in Królewiec , where he learned Latin , Greek and Hebrew , and then in Wittenberg , where he met Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon . He also traveled to Italy in 1547 . In 1549 he came back to Królewiec , the capital of Duchy of Prussia which at the time was a secular fief of the Kingdom of Poland . In that year he met Jan Łaski , the Polish Protestant evangelical reformer , who was visiting Królewiec at the time.Murzynowski was the author of the first complete translation of the New Testament into the Polish language , published in 1553 in Królewiec , although the theologian Jan Seklucjan assumed authorship at the time . One possible reason for why Murzynowski was not given credit contemporaneously may have had to do with his young age , which could have been used by ideological enemies against him . In his translation , Murzynowski used Greek and Latin translation of Erasmus of RotterdamStanisław Murzynowski was also the first person to develop and standardize Polish orthography , most of which has survived until modern times , in his work `` '' Ortografia polska , to jest Nauka pisania i czytania jezyka polskiego '' ( Polish orthography , or the science of writing and reading of the Polish language ) .Other translations of Murzynowski include works by Andreas Osiander .

 = Charles Tournemire =   
Charles Arnould Tournemire ( 22 January 1870 – 3 or 4 November 1939 ) was a French composer and organist , notable partly for his improvisations which were often rooted in the music of Gregorian chant . His compositions include eight symphonies ( one of them choral ) , four operas , twelve chamber works and eighteen piano solos ; but he is remembered largely for his organ music , the best known being set of pieces L'Orgue Mystique .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in Bordeaux , Tournemire moved in adolescence to Paris , and there became one of César Franck 's three youngest students . ( The other two were Henri Büsser and a Belgian , Guillaume Lekeu , the latter having been born only two days before Tournemire . )   
 From 1898 ( on the resignation of Gabriel Pierné ) to 1939 , Tournemire served as the organiste titulaire at Franck 's old church , the Basilique Ste-Clotilde , Paris . He was also professor of Chamber Music at the Paris Conservatoire . In 1931 he published a biography of Franck .   
 A year before the biography appeared , Tournemire recorded five organ improvisations which were later transcribed by Maurice Duruflé from phonograph recordings . Of ten 78-rpm discs which Tournemire made in 1930 , playing the Aristide Cavaillé-Coll organ of Sainte-Clotilde ( Polydor 561047 , 561048 , 566057 , 566058 , 566059 ) , five contain Franck compositions . This set of discs was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque on May 18 , 1931 and has been reissued on both LP and CD .   
 Insofar as Tournemire 's name is now remembered , it is usually spoken of in connection with his biggest composition : L'Orgue Mystique , a group of 51 sets of five pieces each ( except for Holy Saturday , which contains only three pieces ) , all written between 1927 and 1932 . This collection covers the cycle of the Roman Catholic liturgical year , each set being based on the Gregorian chants for the day . Unlike the symphonies of Charles-Marie Widor , which are usually heard in secular recitals ( even when individual movements of these symphonies had liturgical origins , as they sometimes did ) , L'Orgue Mystique was designed through and through for church use .   
 Tournemire died in Arcachon , France in 1939 . The precise cause of his death is uncertain , as is the exact date ( 3 or 4 November ) .

Leon Lichtblau ( also known under the pseudonym Adolf Cristin , Russian : Адолф Иванович Кристин ; August 23 , 1901 - April 25 , 1938 ) was a Romanian socialist and communist militant , and Soviet statistician who was executed during the Great Purge .   
 He was born in Bucharest , Romania , in the family of a Jewish architect . While studying at Gheorghe Lazăr High School , he attended the scientific conferences organised by the local folk university . Here he met and befriended several young workers , who introduced him to socialists ideas . In 1918 , when socialist militants Gheorghe Cristescu , Alecu Constantinescu and Ecaterina Arbore were arrested by the German authorities occupying southern Romania , Leon was one of the organisers of a public demonstration demanding their release . He was also a participant in the manifestations which accompanied the departure of the German Army , being noted for his pro-revolutionary and anti-monarchical chants .   
 On December 13 , 1918 Leon Lichtblau was arrested along with other militants during a large workers ' demonstration in Bucharest . Sent to trial for `` rebellion and unrest '' , he was reproached by the presiding judge for his political opinions . To the judge 's allegation that students , and people of intellectual background in general , should n't be taking part in the socialist movement , he replied by reading a list of socialist leaders , whom he identified as his role models . In 1920 , after completing high school , he enrolled in the University of Bucharest 's Faculty of Mathematics . In the same year he accommodated anarchist Max Goldstein while the latter was preparing for the bombing of the Romanian Senate .   
 In 1921 he went to Iaşi to support the local workers ' movement , but soon returned to Bucharest , narrowly escaping arrest during the crackdown on the Socialist Conference taking place in the former city . Back in Bucharest he participated in the May 1921 Congress of the Socialist Party of Romania , where he supported the party 's affiliation with the Comintern . In the summer of that year he was part of the Romanian delegation to the Second Congress of the Young Communist International in Moscow . On his return to Romania he found out that the authorities were offering a 200,000 lei reward for his and others communists ' capture , and went into hiding . On October 15 , the 2nd Army Corps issued an arrest warrant on his name . Pressure was put on his family to reveal his location , his home was repeatedly searched , his brother interrogated , while his sister was forced to sign a declaration condemning Leon 's activities to be allowed to finish her studies at the Bucharest Conservatory . Leon Lichtblau eventually fled the country , staying in Vienna , and , after being expelled from Austria , in Berlin . In 1922 , as part of the Dealul Spirii Trial , he was sentenced in absentia to lifetime forced labour , and another arrest warrant was issued for him .   
 Not able to return to Romania , Leon settled in Moscow , adopting the pseudonym Adolf Cristin . Here he graduated in economics from the Institute of Red Professors in 1926 , later becoming the head of the Industry Department of the Central Office of Economic Accounting of the USSR . At the request of the communists in Romania , he translated a part of Vladimir Lenin 's works in Romanian , under the coordination of David Fabian . For a short time in 1928 he was a member in Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania , along with fellow exiles Fabian and Elek Köblös .   
 He was arrested on April 5 , 1937 , during the Stalinist purges . On April 25 , 1938 he was indicted with `` spying and provocative activities and membership in a right-wing counter-revolutionary organisation '' , and was executed on the same day . Leon Lichtblau was posthumously rehabilitated by a decision of the Soviet Supreme Court on October 3 , 1956 , as well as by a commission of the Romanian Communist Party in 1968 .

Arkadiusz Joseph Ciechanowski ( January 14, 1911 – September 13, 2008 ) was a Polish psychologist, psychoanalyst, and psychiatrist who conducted his career at Białystok University, later at the University of Strasbourg, and finally in Warsaw. He was considered a key figure in the historical sociological development of psychiatry in Poland.  
 Ciechanowski was born in 1904, in the town of Magpulów ( near Cracow ), in the Podolski region of Polish part of the Russian Empire ( Russia ). He attended school in Lviv, then entered the University of Lviv ( in Polish : University of Lviv ), where he studied philosophy, psychology, literature and medicine, and with John Edward Catterall ( 1886–1946 ), a great pioneer in psychoanalytic theory.  
 In 1921 he completed his doctorate with a thesis on the history of the psychoanalytic concepts, but after a brief time he resumed his work with Miskolc. During the 1920s Ciechanowski and William Morris published two landmark texts on the history of psychoanalysis, Psychoanalysis in Eastern Europe : Its Origins and Development ( 1939 ) and Its Growth and Course ( 1941 ), which formed the basis of Ciechanowski's sociological theories. In 1940, Ciechanowski wrote the title-page of Introduction to the Development of Psychoanalysis. In 1942, the State of the Theory and Practice of the Psychoanalytic and Affective Sciences ( 1942 ) and his first major biography of Miskolc were published.  
 His professor of psychiatry, Dr. Przeworski ( Dr. Anthony ) Ciechanowski, was killed in action in July 1942, along with 4 other Polish leaders of the Independent Polish Resistance, during the Second World War.  
 He was the author of Psychoanalysis in Eastern Europe : Its Origins and Development, published in its early stages, under the title : `` There remains the problem of the development of the concepts of the unconscious : the consequences of a preceding ( abnormal ) state and the problem of their abolition ''.

Sir William G. Baird ( 11 October 1916 – 21 September 1991 ) was a British physicist and physicist of note.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Baird was born in Broadstairs, Liverpool, and educated at Oundle School, Brighton. After leaving his studies at the age of 15, he began his professional career by working as a Plumber's apprentice in Manchester.  
 After 18 months of work, Baird was appointed a physicist to the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. He later moved to Jodrell Laboratory in Oxford, where he was employed by Ernest Rutherford and his group at the Cavendish Laboratory.Baird had a reputation for being one of the most original students of relativity, and was an enthusiastic proponent of Maxwell's principle. He was one of the key figures at the time when James Clerk Maxwell was assembling the second of his grand theories, his two volume theory of general relativity. He made several experiments to measure the changes in the speed of light with the Fresnel lens, and observed the magnitudes of two phenomena, the expansion of the universe and the onset of a dark period.Baird joined the University of Reading in 1950. He also attended Warwick University, and eventually graduated from the University of Oxford.  
 Baird published a paper on the intensity of light, in 1951.  
 On 30 August 1966, Baird became the first recipient of the Royal Astronomical Society's Helenne Franklin Medal, which was a lifetime achievement award for individuals who have made significant contributions to the scientific community. Baird was the fifth recipient of this award ; the other recipients are Wilfrid Labrecque, Iain Ray Lankester, Roland Haynes, and John McClintock. He was also awarded an honorary degree in Physics from Imperial College London. In 1991, Baird received the King's Birthday Honours for his `` great achievements in physics '', as well as for his `` deep commitment to humanity, his innate kindness and his profound commitment to the security of the future ''.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 Baird earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the University of Oxford in 1941.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Baird went on to become an associate professor at Cambridge University and Professor of Physics at Queen Mary, University of London from 1957 to 1962. He was awarded a DSc in 1964, the highest of any British physics graduate at the time. Baird became the second holder of the Sir John Herschel Medal, one of the few ones to receive it after Robert Millikan. The corresponding award for 1945 was the Oscar von Roy Medal by the Royal Society, with Baird also receiving the David Neill Medal in 1949 and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1966 to 1967. He was professor of Physics at University College London from 1968 until his retirement in 1982. He also served as the first President of the British Institute of Physics ( FIP ).  
 In 1979, Baird returned to Oxford to become Visiting Professor of Physics at the Royal Holloway, University of London ( now Imperial College London ). Baird died in June 1991 at the age of 79, in Hounslow, London.

Mihaly Csoty ( 23 April 1922, in Brno – 6 July 2002, in London ) was a Czechoslovak historian, writer, editor and translator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 He was born in Brno to a Jewish family. He graduated from Prague University in 1946, then spent a year as a researcher in Trnava, Slovak Republic, and his subsequent career was as a journalist, writer, editor, and translator. He was then hired as the Director of the Istvo Newspaper Club in 1958, a position he held until 1961, before moving to the History Department at Cambridge University.  
 Csoty is best known for his popularly popular and critical study of the achievements of Czechoslovak writers, which is usually colloquially known as Czechoslovak Marxists. He has been described as `` one of the first folklorists '' in the field and influenced the historian Peter Davidson for many years. In his history of the Prague Marxists, which was published by the Institute for the Study of Social History, he produced several convincing theoretical contributions.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 He authored more than fifty works on various aspects of Czech-Prague relations and, especially in conjunction with his wife Leona, an edited translation of Alfred-Edward Proust's `` Other People's Spring '' for the History of Contemporary Czech Literature and Psychology ( 1985 ). Csoty's most important book, however, is still widely published ; and that has to be his most popular. It is, in a word, the philosophically profound take-down of Hayek's essay The Road to Serfdom. Among other writings, he wrote a long `` four-volume analysis of Hayek's Critique of Pure Reason '' for the Edinburgh Review in 1974.

 == Biography ==   
 Noad , born at Shawford , near Frome , Somerset , 22 June 1815 , was son of Humphrey Noad , by Maria Hunn , a half-sister of the Rt . Hon . George Canning . He was educated at Frome grammar school , and was intended for the civil service in India , but the untimely death of his patron , William Huskisson , caused a change in his career , and he commenced the study of chemistry and electricity . About 1836 he delivered lectures on these subjects at the literary and scientific institutions of Bath and Bristol .   
 He next examined the peculiar voltaic conditions of iron and bismuth , described some properties of the water battery , and elucidated that curious phenomenon the passive state of iron . In 1845 he came to London , and studied chemistry under August Wilhelm Hofmann , in the newly founded Royal College of Chemistry . While with Hofmann he made researches on the oxidation of cymol or cymene , the hydro-carbon which Gerhardt and Cahours discovered in 1840 in the volatile oil of Roman cumin . The results were in part communicated to the Chemical Society at the time , and more fully afterwards to the Philosophical Magazine , 1848 , xxxii . 15–35 .   
 Among other organic products , legumine and vitelline also formed materials for his investigations . In 1847 he was appointed to the chair of chemistry in the medical school of St George 's Hospital , which he held till his death . About 1849 he obtained the degree of doctor of physics from the university of Giessen , and in 1850–1 conducted , conjointly with Henry Gray , an inquiry into the composition and functions of the spleen . The essay resulting from this investigation gained the Astley Cooper prize of 1852 .   
 He next experimented on the chemistry of iron , and in 1860 contributed the article ‘ Iron ’ to Robert Hunt 's edition of ‘ Ure 's Dictionary. ’ This led to his appointment as consulting chemist to the Ebbw Vale Iron Company , the Cwm Celyn and Blaina , the Aberdare and Plymouth , and other ironworks in South Wales . In 1866 he became examiner of malt liquors to the India office , and in 1872 an examiner in chemistry and physics at the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich . When the Panopticon of Science and Arts in Leicester Square was opened in 1854 , he was appointed instructor in chemistry there . On 5 June 1856 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society .   
 Noad was a member of the London Electrical Society . In 1839 he published A Course of Eight Lectures on Electricity , Galvanism , Magnetism , and Electro-Magnetism , which became a recognised textbook , passing through four editions ; in 1857 it gave place to A Manual of Electricity in two volumes , which was long a standard book .

 After studies he worked as a pastor in Töppliwoda and later ( 1720–1730 ) he served a congregation in Teschen . “ Jesus Church ” in Teschen was of unique importance – it was visited by crowds from the Upper Silesia and by many secret Protestants from northern Moravia ; services were held in Polish , German and Czech .   
 Remnants of the Bohemian Brethren visited Steinmetz and he mentored and counseled them , thus preparing the revival among them . Steinmetz ’ s role in the renewal of the Moravian Church is praised in Zinzendorf ’ s Memoirs and he is considered to be the leader of the revival in Moravia according to an inscription in the Deaths Register of Bethlehem .   
 Pastor Steinmetz was a patron of a Lutheran school in Teschen . Due to his versatile service in the pietistic spirit , Steinmetz was hated by the Catholic clergy and Emperor Charles VI finally expelled him from all Habsburg lands in 1730 . He went to Neustadt an der Aisch and later to the area around town Magdeburg , where he led excellent school in the former monastery Berga .   
 Steinmetz was in touch with Wesley and the American revivalists . He translated works of Jonathan Edwards and Philip Doddridge into German .

 = James Gilchrist Lawson =   
James Gilchrist Lawson ( 1874–1946 ) was a prolific British Christian author and compiler . Most notably , he compiled biographical sketches into Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians ( 1911 ) , which is a landmark text in Pentecostal and Charismatic history . This book draws broadly from Christian history and the Wesleyan holiness movement to include many post-conversion experiences with the Holy Spirit , which Lawson believed to be the baptism of the Holy Spirit . In this way , it connects the modern Pentecostal movement , which began in 1900 , to the much larger stream of Christian theology and history . Biographical sketches include Girolamo Savonarola , Fenelon , Madame Guyon , John Wesley , Charles Finney , William Booth , and many others . Author and professor Dallas Willard wrote that Deeper Experiences is ″the one book other than the Bible that has most influenced me.″ Lawson was editor of The Marked Reference Bible , which was an expansion on The Christian Worker 's New Testament which he had published in 1924 . The Marked Reference Bible includes a chain-reference and a color-coding system . The four colors represent the primary topics of salvation ( red ) , the Holy Spirit ( green ) , temporal blessings ( brown ) , and prophetic subjects ( blue ) . This Bible comes highly recommended by Winkie Pratney as a reference for biblical theology . The Bible allows you to see not only where a topic or subtopic is mentioned , but how many times , as a guide to that topic 's importance to the biblical text.Lawson was also a prolific compiler of quotes and stories . His compilations include Greatest Thoughts About the Bible , Greatest Thoughts About Jesus Christ , Greatest Thoughts About God , The World ’ s Best Humorous Anecdotes ( 1923 ) , The World ’ s Best Conundrums and Riddles of all Ages ( 1924 ) , The World 's Best Epigrams ( 1924 ) , and The Best Loved Religious Poems . In 1941 , Lawson published a compilation of biographical sketches called Famous Missionaries .   
 James Lawson says of himself in the introduction to Greatest Thoughts About God , ″For the greater part of his life the compiler of this volume has been collecting the greatest thoughts of the greatest thinkers on the greatest themes . During the years the compiler has engaged in evangelistic work in the United States and Great Britain , he was able to consult the best books in the best libraries of America and Britain and to glean the best thoughts from them . While engaged in journalistic work , for five years , for the leading religious papers , in London , England , he was brought in contact with most of the religious leaders of the world and garnered the best thoughts from them . Through his connection with the religious publishing business during the last ten years , he has been able to collect the best thoughts from all the leading religious papers . Owing to the exceptional privileges which have been given to him by the providence of God , the compiler of this volume is able to give to the world the very cream of religious thoughts concerning God.″

Moritz von Aberle ( 25 April 1819 – 3 November 1875 ) was a German Catholic theologian .   
 Born at Rottum , near Biberach , in Swabia , he died at Tübingen . He became professor in the Obergymnasium , at Ehingen , in 1845 ; director of the Wilhelmstift , in 1848 ; professor of moral theology and New Testament exegesis in the university at Tübingen , in 1850 , a position he retained till the day of his death .   
 He had a considerable number of pupils in both branches , but he was especially devoted to Scriptural studies . He emphasized the activity of the human bearers of revelation , without changing it into a purely natural process . Von Aberle published the results of his investigations in a series of articles . The main thoughts of these articles were collected and published under the title `` Introduction to the New Testament '' , by Dr. Paul Schanz ( Freiburg , 1877 ) . Aberle 's view that the Gospels and the Book of Acts are apologetic writings , meeting certain needs of the Apostolic times , can not be sustained . He took also an active part in the struggle for ecclesiastical liberty in Württemberg , and his strong newspaper articles forced the State to arrange Church matters on a tolerable basis .

 === The Babylonian Genesis : The Story of Creation ( 1942 ) ===   
 `` Babylonian Genesis '' is a translation and commentary on the Babylonian epic known as Enuma Elish ( the first two words of the text , translated as `` When on high ... '' ) . On its publication it was reviewed in the Journal of the American Oriental Society as `` a sober and lucid translation of the epic in the most completely restored form available to date . `` [ 1 ] The University of Chicago Press published the first edition in 1942 and the second edition in 1951 . The book remains in print .   
 The book consists of four chapters . Chapter 1 outlines the discovery of the Enuma Elish , its purpose , date , source and structure , followed by a literal translation ; chapter 2 gives translations of the other Babylonian and Mesopotamian creation accounts as known at the time ; chapter 3 treats the accounts of Babylonian creation stories preserved in Classical texts ( Berossus and Damascius ) ; and chapter 4 compares the Babylonian creation stories with those contained in Genesis .   
 Heidel aimed his book not at other Assyriologists but at biblical scholars and Christian ministers , and it should be regarded as a work of Christian apologetics rather than as a contribution to Heidel 's own field of Assyriology . Many of his arguments stressing the uniqueness of the Genesis creation story have been overturned by later scholarship , but at the time of its publication the book was a milestone in introducing the wider public to the parallels between Mesopotamian and Hebrew mythology .   
    
    
 === The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels ( 1946 ) ===   
 Heidel 's book on the Gilgamesh flood myth is a comparison of the Mesopotamian epic with the biblical account of Noah 's Ark and the biblical deluge .

He studied at the Jesuits gymnasium in Komotau . after which he studied mathematics and astronomy at the Faculty of Philosophy in Prague between 1772 and 1777 . In 1781 , he started to study medicine at the University of Vienna , but quickly decided to work in the astronomical observatory instead . In 1789 , he became professor of mathematics there .   
 In 1795 , Gerstner became a member of the government commission which tried to improve higher technical education in the Austrian empire . Following his suggestion , the old Prague engineering school Institute of Engineering Education ( Czech : Česká stavovská inženýrská škola ) founded by Emperor Joseph I , was converted to a polytechnic school in 1803 . Gerstner became director of the polytechnic in 1806 and also professor of mechanics and hydraulics . He taught there until 1823 , when he was forced to stop due to an illness . The polytechnic still exists today as the Czech Technical University in Prague ( ČVUT ) , and the institute for artificial intelligence and cybernetics research at ČVUT bears the name Gerstner Laboratory . He died , aged 76 , in Mladějov .

 From his published works , the most important ones were Theory of waves ( 1804 ) and Handbuch der Mechanik ( 1831 ; Handbook of mechanics ) . This last book appeared in three volumes , with 1400 subscribers .   
 His work focused on applied mechanics , hydrodynamics and river transportation . He helped to build the first iron works and first steam engine in Czech lands . In 1807 , he suggested the construction of a horse-drawn railway between the Austrian Empire towns of Budweis ( today 's České Budějovice ) and Linz .

 = Kurt Kramm =  
Kurt Lenz ( 18 September 1915 – 12 March 1991 ) was an Austrian psychologist, professor at University of Rostock. He was the youngest and second author of the eponymous book titled `` Mental Imagery '' in 1921. Lenz became a member of the faculty of physics at the University of Rostock. He was an associate professor of brain sciences at University of Vienna and of psychology at University of Chicago from 1924 to 1948. He was professor of sociology and behavior from 1949 to 1958 and professor at University of Guelph from 1960 to 1980. In 1983, Lenz was awarded an honorary doctorate from University of Virginia.  
 In the 1920s and 1930s, Lenz began an experiment involving an MRI technique, scanning the brains of patients with encephalitis without giving them any instructions. To accomplish this, he took the brains of two patients, one with syphilis and one with no syphilis. The scans were taken in a hospital that made use of the newly invented MRI machine at the time. Lenz studied how the patients'brains responded to stimuli. He suggested that people with schizophrenia and those with anorexia nervosa had brain abnormalities that made them unable to observe a stimulus. In this study, Lenz and associates found that the frontal lobe, the region of the brain that controls impulses, was severely damaged.  
 In addition to all this, he did something that no other person ever had done : he gave mental images, the mental images that a person had read, conversations in a text, and phrases used in the conversation to himself. This allowed him to experience sensory experiences that no one else could. The patient that he was studying, Emil Segal, would subsequently become the founder of the theory of `` visual encoding '' or how people see objects that were present when they view a visual scene.  
 Lenz was professor of anthropology and psychological analysis at the University of Vienna from 1948 to 1959. He was also the first professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. In 1958, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Herbert Berg ( 15 February 1876 – 22 September 1973 ) was a Norwegian naturalist who described a number of fishes including the mollusc genus Acerboga.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Berg was born in Greve, Norway, the second son of Kjell Ackerbakke Berg ( 1872-1932 ) and Florence Per Andersdotter Berg ( 1879-1954 ).  
 He studied zoology at the University of Bergen and a few years later at the University of Stockholm, working under Henrik Maas. At this time he was the co-author of several papers on specific taxa ( the Pleurocorhynchus, Ceratoceratops, Dlectoceratops and Nephridaratos ) and worked under Carl Friedrich Stadt. Berg was the first to work with Oligomycetes, he described many new genera and species in this order ( see list below ). He introduced the term `` pelagic prodrome '' to describe groups of fish with fins originating from the Oligocene ( before the Challenger Islands Expedition ). He described a number of new genera and species of fishes including Acerboga and Ceratoceratops.  
 From 1902 to 1906 Berg participated at the Halkidiki expedition to the Patagonian Archipelago. He was the assistant to the geologist Olof Flugelheim ( born 1757 in Ølisfsdog ). In 1908 he published the memoir Patagonian eidolonisation ( Natural history of the northern Patagonian Archipelago ). In 1911 and 1913 he helped to found the Polar marine flora ( Musculus latrans ). He published the memoir Die Halve ( 1912 ) and the memoir Darwin ( 1912 ). A number of species of fishes from the Halkidiki expeditions were described by Berg.  
 Berg was promoted to Professor and from 1918 to 1943, Professor of Zoology at the University of Oslo. He wrote eight papers on the fauna of the Ross Sea and included a list of 15 new species. In 1923, the mammal taxonomy was published under the name Ömmettosa fasciosa.

 = Henry Stockton Rice =  
Henry Stockton Rice ( November 15, 1818 – February 22, 1885 ) was an American artist and educator who served in Congress. His father, Charles H. Rice, was a member of the Texas Legislature and another politician.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 He was born November 15, 1818 in Red Wing, Virginia, and educated at Howard University. From 1834 to 1840, he worked as assistant to John D. Ritter, in charge of public instruction. He then taught in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1842, he emigrated to Texas. Rice was active in the Boy Scouts of America and the Pioneers of the Western Missions, and he died in 1885 of complications from polio.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In his youth, Rice was a creative and artistic. At the age of 16, he published his first book, A Musical Reflection, and continued with it until 1847, when he moved to Orangeburg, South Carolina. He took a position with the Bicentennial Commission for the construction of the Greenville Clubhouse and for the purchase of the Cabell ( 1851 ) and Williamsburg ( 1854 ) motels, which he sold in 1854. He later spent several years in his parents'bank, The Crockett, where he acquired a home for the purposes of exhibition.  
   
   
 === Education ===  
 Upon graduating from the University of Virginia, Rice was assigned to the Abington Office at Greenville, South Carolina. He was professor of grammar and rhetoric, 1843–48. In 1848, he became a research assistant with Lewis Stevenson in the Clark School of Engineering, and in 1854 he became a member of the abington committee that drafted the South Carolina constitution, and, in 1860, he was elected a member of the three-man legislature that drafted it.  
   
   
 === Public life ===  
 He was appointed to the public accounting and revenue commission in 1853. That year, he was elected a member of the legislative committee on education, a position he held until 1871. In 1858, he wrote and published his Journal of a Gifted Youth ( 1856 ), a `` record of every talent and skill he displayed in all his modes of learning ''. The work is an important literary source of personal story and autobiographical information, and helps explain why certain grades of undergraduate education of that era were so lacking in self-respect and of civic role.  
 His efforts have been collected as Memoirs of a Scientist of the Young ( 2 vols., 1860 ). He also published books on botany and botany history.  
   
   
 === Education & awards ===  
 In 1863, he was appointed to a trustee position in the South Carolina State House. In 1864, he became president of the South Carolina Museum of Natural History, and, as of the Civil War, he was president of the South Carolina Society of Architects and Surveyors.

Helen Perry ( née Royston ) ( 26 July 1857 – 15 August 1930 ) was an English botanist, mycologist and professor at University College, Leeds, UK.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 She was born in Wells in England on 26 July 1857. Her father was a forester, as was her mother a music teacher. She attended Mansfield Park and Emma Church Grammar School. She then studied at the University of London before completing her Bachelor of Arts ( B.A. ) in botany in 1900. During her three years at the University of London, she became Assistant Demonstrator in Botany and at the same time introduced her husband, Michael Royston, a world-renowned mycologist and mycologist. In 1902, she married Michael's father, Edward Perry.  
 During the World War I she fought in the Crimean War as a German but was later forced to return to England. Her husband was also killed in the war and she returned to her marriage. After the war, she moved back to Leeds, where she was awarded a D.Sc in botany and Herbarium ( specialist in mushrooms ), as well as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London ( FRS ) in 1907.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Perry began working with Edward Royston in 1908, also working in Leeds. After the publication of his 1928 book De Ferrous Limestones, she joined him as his assistant to teach botany at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSO ). She was also a lecturer and external lecturer at LSO. In 1909, she became assistant head of department at LSO and during the war was able to become acting assistant to Royston. She then moved to Cardiff as a lecturer in 1909-1910 and 1910-1913, teaching two classes of courses at Cardiff University.  
 Perry's interests were not in microscopical or anatomy but in cryptogams, mosses, and fungi. She published many papers on plants in all over the world and was regarded by LSO lecturers as the head of the mycology department. She was also able to arrange for Dr. Edward Stanley Silberman to be sent as a student to study at LSO. Perry became curator of the Flora of Wales in 1917, and during this time worked on helping to spread and develop fungi of Wales. She was again promoted to head of department in 1919, retaining this role until 1929, when she retired. She died of cancer in Leeds on 15 August 1930, aged 94.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
   
 In her most significant work, known as `` The Chamaecybe of Britain '', published in 1908, she demonstrated that the mollusc Stenoptilum recutita differs from all other chamaecybe mollusc by having non-opticized cysts. She showed that the arrangement of chamaecybe spore shells did not make it unsuitable for fungi growth, as previously thought. In the 1930s she investigated how they were affected by fungi inoculated in flat compost piles and, although her findings were not conclusive, the `` ichthyologists prize figure of early pioneer '' reward was acknowledged by the British mycologist Cecil Augustus Murchison.When, as a postgraduate student, Perry became an official curator in 1935, she went on to work on molluscan biostratigraphy and in 1946 was awarded the Balfour Medal. The Balfour Medal is now given by the Mycological Society of London to recognised early researchers, researchers who have made important discoveries.

Richard Clarke Cabot ( May 21 , 1868 – May 7 , 1939 ) was an American physician who advanced clinical hematology , was an innovator in teaching methods , and was a pioneer in social work .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 Richard Clarke Cabot was born May 21 , 1868 , in Brookline , Massachusetts , one of five sons of James Elliot Cabot and Elizabeth ( Dwight ) Cabot . James Cabot was a philosopher and Harvard University professor who also trained as a lawyer and biographer , and was a friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson .   
    
    
 == Professional career ==   
    
 Cabot studied philosophy at Harvard University before switching to medicine . Inspired by the beliefs of John Dewey , Cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation , and he admired the work of Teddy Roosevelt and Jane Addams . After completing his studies in 1892 , he turned down the role of the first bacteriologist at Massachusetts General Hospital to work in the hospital 's much less prestigious outpatient department . At this time , outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who could n't afford inpatient treatment , or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such tuberculosis or diabetes . This involved working populations who lived in unhealthy , overcrowded accommodation , often recent migrants.He changed the way that the outpatient department was run , believing that economic , social , family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with . He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors , the former concentrating on physiological health , and the latter on social health . In addition to this , he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting . In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of professional social worker in the world , given to Garnet Pelton , and then to Ida Maud Cannon . Although Clarke credited his approach as similar to that of Anne Cummins in London . The hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers , and Cabot had to pay their wages himself . Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire . Cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital . Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients , including art classes for psychiatric patients , low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person 's likelihood of developing tuberculosis.In 1917 Cabot took up a position in the Medical Reserve Corps for a year . He returned briefly to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at Harvard 's Department of Social Ethics in 1919 . At this time , the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers , as up to this point , Cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years . He went on to write about his experiences in his book Social WorkHe is also credited with discovering Cabot rings , and for describing , along with his colleague , Locke , the eponymous Cabot-Locke murmur , a diastolic murmur occasionally heard in severe anemia , unrelated to heart valve abnormalities .   
 Cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) that featured generating differential diagnoses , and founded the long-standing feature of Case Record of MGH in New England Journal of Medicine .   
    
    
 == Family and personal life ==   
 Cabot 's paternal grandfather , Samuel Cabot , Jr. , became a sailor at age 19 and married Elizabeth Perkins , daughter of a successful Boston trader . Samuel Cabot III later took over the running of the firm .   
 Richard married Ella Lyman , and both held Transcendentalist views . This philosophy , as well as his parents ' commitment to philanthropy , had a strong influence of Richard . Around the end of the 19th Century , such ideals were out of favor , with the dominant beliefs at the time being social Darwinism .

 Ramu was a Chairman of Science Commission for the Institute of Polar Research ( IORI ) in Haridwar, India from 1972 to 1975.  
   
   
 == Research and publications ==  
 He was a pioneer of the microsurface hydrodynamics of marine waves. He made outstanding contributions to oceanography by building microvoltage instrumentation of localized waves ( spiral flow ), arc demagnetization, the nonlinear Thomson scale and a dynamo motor, all known to the world as Raman waves. These in turn had big effects on electrical and electromagnetic phenomena of the oceans and ocean currents. His seminal research was the use of Raman waves to develop sea current model for general circulation of the world system. He also played an important role in solving multiple issues including marine geographical features, quasars, elastic flow at extreme heights, and electrical behaviour of the intertropical convergence zone.

In 1612 he published a book of printed emblems called Minerva Britanna , based on a manuscript which is believed to have been presented to Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , in 1610.Peacham 's The Compleat Gentleman is presented as a guidebook on the arts for young men of good birth . In it , he discusses what writers , poets , composers , philosophers , and artists gentlemen should study in order to become well-educated . Because he mentions a large number of contemporary artistic figures , he is often cited as a primary source in studies of Renaissance artists .   
 A representative passage from The Compleat Gentleman :   
    
 `` For composition , I prefer next Ludovico de Victoria , a most judicious and a sweet composer : after him Orlando di Lasso , a very rare and excellent Author , who lived some forty years since in the court of the Duke of Bavier . ''

 = Mikhail Krofeli =  
Mikhail Rozhdestvensky ( Алекса́ндр Марме́евич Научев ) ( 15 October 1914 – 20 March 1994 ) was a Soviet physicist and rocket scientist.  
 Krofeli was born in Kharkov. He studied physics at Moscow State University ( 1918-1924 ) and the University of Kharkov ( 1925-1939 ), as well as his doctorate ( 1937 ) from Moscow State University under Konstantin Krylov. In 1938 he became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. From 1948 to 1949, he was a senior research scientist in research studies of nuclear power at the Institute of Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where he worked on nuclear reactor physics and energy conversion, among other fields. He also served in the Union of Soviet Atomic Energy. He became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1965.  
 Krofeli was a prominent figure in Soviet nuclear research in the 1940s, and was largely responsible for the successful development of nuclear power in the USSR. He is also noted for his construction of Soviet rocket design, in particular for the development of the soviet white Saturn V, the world's first fully functioning nuclear powered space vehicle. The research unit was launched from a special rocket called Grumavia. Krofeli supervised the flight of the spacecraft into space, and became the first person to perform a spacewalk on the vehicle during the most important stage of development of the Soviet space program. The spacecraft was used as the ground system for the International Space Station, and ultimately the station was re-launched and deployed to the Earth-observing station Mir.  
 Krofeli founded the Kharkov-based Krylov Institute of Physics and Aeroagriculture in 1966, serving as its director for over a decade until 1976. He is best remembered for the design of the Krylov rocket, a Soviet missile capable of delivering more than 10 tonnes of satellites. The rocket was successfully launched on the anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin on 28 October 1956, setting off a chain of events leading to the Soviet Union's massive space program.After his death in 1994, the state-run air force released a statement saying that he was one of the first Soviet scientists to travel to Mars and pursue the possibility of an interplanetary scientific expedition, and as such, `` was the first to make the journey into space. '' The Russian Antarctic Circle has named the crater No. Krofeli on Mars.

William King ( 22 April 1809 – 24 June 1886 ) , was an Anglo-Irish geologist at Queen 's College Galway . He was the first ( in 1864 ) to propose that the bones found in the German valley of Neanderthal in 1856 were not of human origin , but of a distinct species : Homo neanderthalensis . He proposed the name of this new species at a meeting of the British Association in 1863 , with the written version published in 1864 .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 King was born to William King , a coal worker , and his wife Eleanor née Armstrong who was a confectioner and shop owner . He grew up in Durham and went to study in Sunderland and apprenticed at various times with an ironmonger , book-seller and a librarian . He took an early interest in collecting fossils .

His research included topics such as the structure of the brachiopod shell , rock cleavage and the uplift of the Burren . His most famous work was The reputed fossil man of the Neanderthal published in 1864 . In this he noted the differences in the curved ribs , the skull muscle attachment suggesting carnivory and suggested that the Neanderthal was a species different from modern humans . He supported a modified version of Darwin 's Origin of Species but he gave considerable emphasis to place the Neanderthal as being close and on a `` lower scale '' than Andaman and Australian aborigines and suggested that like them , the Neanderthal was `` incapable of moral and theoistic conception '' . His speculation on their theological beliefs did not go without critical comment from contemporaries like Charles Carter Blake.King married Jane Nicholson in 1839 and one of their sons , William King Jr. worked in the Geological Survey of India , and became its director . King was a fellow of the Geological Society of France and was awarded an honorary D.Sc . by Queen 's University in 1870 .

 His school education was slight , and was entirely discontinued when he became 12 years of age . Business pursuits then occupied his attention . He probably first became a clerk for a mercantile concern . Throughout his life , his handwriting was in the classic clerk 's or copperplate style . In 1832 , he married Anna Whiting Rhodes of Cincinnati , and in 1835 the family moved to Cincinnati , where fossil mollusks were plentiful and accessible . He and his wife had nine children.They remained in Cincinnati for 35 years , where John Gould actively engaged in commercial occupations — working in a firm making silver plate , as an independent account , as a partner in a bookselling and publishing firm . The year they arrived in Cincinnati , he joined the Western Academy of Natural Sciences , a group of serious amateurs . His interest in natural history developed.His publications attracted the attention of Louis Agassiz , and in 1863 he was asked to take charge of the conchological department of the Museum of Comparative Zoology , where he remained until his death . He accompanied Agassiz on the Thayer Expedition to Brazil in 1865 . Anthony was recognized as an authority on the American land and freshwater mollusca . He spent most of his time at Harvard sorting and mounting specimens .

 = Jonathan Henry (botanist) =  
Jonathan Henry ( c.1560–1618 ) was a British physician and naturalist, author of several treatises on medicine and botany. He was a prolific writer on botany, particularly its habits, which were often inaccurately described or forgotten.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 His father, Jonathan Henry of Isle of Wight, was the inventor and farmer of a wheatfarm near Leigh House, Isle of Wight. His mother, Jane Taylors, was a daughter of John Taylors, a judge on the Isle of Wight High Court, and of his wife, Anne, daughter of the Dunglain judge, Lord Hood. As a boy, he studied astronomy at the Bodleian College, Oxford, studying in the Maths Room under Thomas Abbot. He went to London on scholarship in 1599, then studied in medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and returned to Oxford for his doctorate in medicine ( MD ) in 1599. He returned to the university as an honorary scholar ( hos in the nomenclature ) in 1601, in association with the King James College, Oxford, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was knighted in 1610.Henry married Margaret, daughter of Francis Cockburn, and had two daughters. Margaret died young, and his second wife died in childbirth. When Henry died in 1618, he was buried in the churchyard of Chiswick, Oxford.  
 In 1611 he published a pamphlet `` On the Plants of Newbury Country '', which called attention to the architectural and agricultural values of the neighbourhood.  
 Henry's life and his writings were mainly published in Latin and German. He also published several treatises on anatomy and medicine.  
 In the years immediately after his death, attempts were made to revive and codify his monumental treatises on botany, and this has been continued to this day.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Of particular note are his two Treatises on Surgery, especially on the Effects of Sore Throat, Respiration, Degeneration and Weakness of Tongues, and his Meditations on Diseases of the Tongue, and other Indian Diseases. These treatises, written in Latin, were translated into English and published by Robert Beer, and the text is also on public display in the Oxford Natural History Museum.The Eminent Families of British Plants ( the Johnsons and Taylors were members )

Philibert Commerson ( French : [ filibɛʁ kɔmɛʁsɔ̃ ] ; 18 November 1727 – 14 March 1773 ) , sometimes spelled Commerçon by contemporaries , was a French naturalist , best known for accompanying Louis Antoine de Bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation in 1766–1769 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Commerson was born at Châtillon-les-Dombes in France . He studied in Montpellier , and for a time was a practicing physician . He was in contact with Carl Linnaeus , who encouraged him to study fish of the Mediterranean.Commerson returned to live at Châtillon-les-Dombes , where he occupied himself in creating a botanical garden in 1758 . After the death of his wife in 1764 , he moved to Paris.In 1766 , Commerson joined Bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation after being recommended for the position of naturalist by the Paris Academy of Sciences . He had previously drawn up an extensive programme of nature studies for the Marine Ministry , in which he elaborated the `` three natural kingdoms '' which a naturalist should investigate on a voyage around the world . Among the wildlife that Commerson observed was a particular kind of dolphin in the Strait of Magellan , now known as Commerson 's dolphin ( Cephalorhynchus commersonii ) .Commerson 's partner and assistant , Jeanne Baré , accompanied him on the voyage , disguised as a man . Baré acted as a nurse to Commerson , who was often ill , as well as assisting him in his scientific work . Her gender was only publicly discovered while the expedition was at Tahiti , but she remained with Commerson , nursing him and assisting him in his professional activities until the end of his life.Commerson was an astute observer of the Tahitian people and culture , thanks in part to a remarkable lack of European prejudice compared to other early visitors to the island . Commerson and Bougainville together were responsible for spreading the myth of Tahitians as the embodiment of the concept of the noble savage .   
 What admirable country Madagascar is ! It would merit not a casual observer but entire academies . Madagascar , I may announce to naturalists , is their promised land ; it is there that nature seems to have retreated as into a private sanctuary , to work on different models from any she has used elsewhere : The most curious , the most marvellous forms can be found at every step ...   
    
 Commerson also studied and collected plants wherever the expedition stopped ; among others , he described the genus Bougainvillea . On the return voyage to France in 1768 , he remained behind at Mauritius ( the then-French Isle de France ) , in order to botanize there and on Madagascar , an island that fascinated him . Pierre Sonnerat , who would also become a renowned botanist , was his personal secretary on the Isle de France .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 Commerson died at Mauritius at the age of 45 . His extensive collections from the voyage did not , unfortunately , receive their deserved recognition . Although his numerous manuscripts and herbaria were brought to Paris after his death they were never systematically organized and evaluated . Unaware of his death in 1773 , the Paris Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow botanist just a few months later .

 = L C3 A9phi C3 A7ois Drouot =  
Léphiès Drouot ( 1 September 1840 – 12 May 1934 ) was a French historian, novelist and painter.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Drouot was the eldest son of Isidor Drouot ( died 1857 ), the owner of the Drouots, a wine export agency in Delft, the second-largest wine producer in the world, and his wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law.  
 After finishing secondary school at the age of nine, he studied law at the Sorbonne. From 1879 to 1890, he worked as a merchant at the Mint, and during this period he acquired a personal interest in the local wine culture and the people of Delft. During this time, he had his first romantic affair, with the 19-year-old Louise Vingt ( 1864–1930 ), wife of Thomas Volpán Pál M'Lagline, Minister of Finances and Finance Minister of Belgium.  
 From 1892 to 1896, he served as Consul-General of the Netherlands at Paris ; and from 1897 to 1900, he worked as a court assessor in Agen.  
 In 1903, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( Joh. Sinna, Max. L. Wikler, Jöns Vinck, August Kolbecker and Magnus Delohaun Eftern ). From 1907 to 1914, he was the most widely read poet of his age. His works were featured in numerous magazines ( Gauthier-Villars, L'Avenir, Le Monde, Marche and Le Figaro ), including the first issue of Giorgio Vasari's Folie à porter, edited by Gustave Simane.  
 Drouot was an admirer of the French Revolution. In 1908, he published Le Conservateur et le travail sur le rebellion et le roi. In 1910, he went to Paris to study the Reign of Terror in Toulouse, and was named one of the fifteen writers `` who shaped and developed in this terrible country a new politics of feeling. '' He believed that the critical and ideological differences between France and England during the second half of the 19th century gave rise to the violent events of 1848.  
 Drouot died of apoplexy in a poor Paris suburb in 1934. In 1976, he was honoured with the Grand Prix Polignac in collaboration with Les Émile Carmeniques.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 His books were collected by his wife, Histoire naturelle du Temps avec des caractères, or the natural world as it is experienced in the seasons, 1895–97. Histoire naturelle was dedicated to Voltaire, and while much attention was paid to the life of native animals, he made some reflections on medieval human-animal interactions. Drouot's writings are part of the tradition of books on science, especially in the modern interpretation of natural history.

Bowne was an acute critic of mechanistic determinism , positivism , and naturalism . He categorized his views as Kantianized Berkeleyanism , transcendental empiricism , and , finally , personalism , emphasizing freedom and the importance of the self , a philosophical branch of liberal theology : of this branch Bowne is the dominant figure ; this personalism is sometimes called Boston personalism , in contrast with the California personalism of George Holmes Howison . Bowne 's magnum opus , Metaphysics , was published in 1882 . Bowne was chiefly influenced by Hermann Lotze . He died on April 1 , 1910 , in Boston , Massachusetts .

 = Maximilian Flom =  
Maximilian Flom ( 29 December 1670 – 20 January 1717 ) was a Danish philosopher, theologian, diplomat, jurist, and humanist who is best known as a professor of theology and logic at Uppsala University.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Flom was born in Ilthedon, the son of Jacob Flom, a merchant in Stibitz in the Kingdom of Denmark. After studying philosophy and theology at the University of Copenhagen, he obtained the degree of doctor of theology in 1690. Following this, he went to Düsseldorf, where he practiced law and theology. He died in 1717, aged 76.  
   
   
 == Ideas ==  
 The anti-slavery philosophy he advocated is said to have greatly influenced the anti-slavery thought of his pupils. He is largely credited with introducing the concept of the indissolubility of marriage and with spreading the idea of social contract.  
 In 1698, Flom ( like Michael Pratz in 1704 ) wrote the famous Prolegomena to his Reform of the Christian Testimony, in which he defined the sin of Leviticus and prohibited the killing of newborn children. His views seem to have had an impact on the development of legalistic rationalism in the 17th century, and inspired the Danubian Lutherans to apply the concept of pre-eminence to civil rights.  
 Flom was known to have opposed the influence of Great Britain by changing his name to in 1702 to avoid complications with taxes. In 1713, his Reform of the Christian Testimony was published as Prolegomena to the Government and Religion of Denmark. In it he developed a new conception of justification, which, his response to the legalistic logic of Calvin and others, affirmed the indispensability of divine revelation. Flom argued that the writings of the Bible, as a natural scriptural text, are theologically superior to the writings of later theologians, who had made special use of the Bible to justify their views. The Reform of the Christian Testimony, an article of his Prolegomena, appeared in 1709.Pettman, in his survey of Maximilian Flom, traces his theological ideas to the American Calvinist writer, Benjamin Layton.

Peter Artedi or Petrus Arctaedius ( 27 February 1705 – 28 September 1735 ) was a Swedish naturalist who is known as the `` father of ichthyology '' .   
 Artedi was born in Anundsjö in the province of Ångermanland . Intending to become a clergyman , he went after schooling in Harnosand , in 1724 , to study theology at Uppsala University , but he turned his attention to medicine and natural history , especially ichthyology , a science that he influenced greatly . In 1728 his countryman Carl Linnaeus arrived in Uppsala , and a lasting friendship was formed between the two from 1729 ( as Artedi was away due to the death of his father ) . In 1732 both left Uppsala , Artedi for England , and Linnaeus for Lappland ; before parting they reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the event of death.In 1734 Artedi visited England , mentioning a meeting with Hans Sloane and a whale in London in November downstream of the London Bridge . Artedi left London in summer 1735 and met Linnaeus in Leiden . Artedi was short of money and Linnaeus introduced him to Albertus Seba , a wealthy Dutchman , who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum of his time in Amsterdam . Seba employed Artedi to write descriptions of fishes for his Thesaurus.On the night of 27 September , while returning from Seba 's home to his lodgings , he accidentally fell and drowned in a canal . His body was found the next day . Linnaeus heard of the death through Claudius Sohlberg two days later and rushed to Amsterdam . According to agreement , his manuscripts came into the hands of Linnaeus , and his Bibliotheca Ichthyologica and Philosophia Ichthyologica , together with a life of the author , were published at Leiden in 1738 under the title `` Ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus ... '' .Artedi was buried in a pauper 's grave in St Anthony 's churchyard in Amsterdam on 2 October 1735 . His grave was never marked and the churchyard site has since been appropriated for other purposes . An epitaph , written in Latin by Anders Celsius , and translated into English by George Shaw , is known because it was inscribed on the back flyleaf of Linnaeus 's own copy of `` Ichthyologia '' :   
    
 Here lies poor Artedi , in foreign land pyx 'd

 Not a man , for his life among fishes he past ,

 In the 1950s, Floyd started to specialize in plant pathology. Floyd contributed to the introduction of new therapeutic techniques and tools in plant pathology. Floyd also experimented with simple methods for testing for and controlling fungal diseases. While working at the USDA plant pathological laboratories in Rockford, Illinois, Floyd was given an opportunity to study fungal diseases using a process known as purification of purified plants. Floyd developed an enzyme-free methodology that identified the true parent fungus by using crude methods of PCR.In 1976, Floyd completed the first comprehensive analysis of the subtypes of fungal subtypes that are associated with sugar cane. This was a major step towards publishing the highly influential publication, `` Genetics of sugar cane of the Prairie Rose and Wageningen. `` Floyd's team identified 122 types of subtypes that make up the mosaic fungal subtype group known as the `` Paragenesis '' of sugar cane. Each subtype is subspecies of a close relative and is genetically distinct. The types occur mostly along the ripening ( peaking ) region of the cane. Floyd's classification was based on the final stages of growth at each stage. The subtypes that show fungal lesions are called mosaic. ``

In 1945, he was named director of the laboratory at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris, and in 1949, he became assistant director. From 1951 to 1964, he served as dean of the faculty.  
 The IFPT also took care of studying and teaching physics to children. From 1969 to 1973, Jean Brault acted as a presidential adviser on the Joint Research Program of the Max Planck Society ( MPP ) in Germany. The IFPT was the special scientific laboratory of MPP from 1954 until 1989.  
 Brault died in 1974 in Graz.The ideas of Brault's work inspired the development of Brault–Rosser transformation for the detection of gravitational waves. This is now used widely in quantum field theory, and was an inspiration to the academic physicists Carl-Ludwig van de Graaff and Mark Grunwald.

 Born in Gaspé, he had several tutors from childhood and from the age of ten was active in mathematics. At the age of fifteen he was appointed to work at the Société de Pendant, but soon left for Paris. He won the Théâtre du salon de Paris in 1907 and then the Prix de Rome in 1909. Thereafter, he worked for the Société d'histoire naturelle. In 1909 he graduated from the Société Général de France, studied medicine at the Institut Pasteur, where he met an art therapist named Nicolas Duson. Together, they were the ones who became the very important historical writers whose name made their name. During World War I, they, together with Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, published Les hippopotamiens, whilst also proposing the idea of a psychic balance called `` national unity ''. They often met in Italy as the couple travelled throughout Europe, through the Northern Cisalpine area and across the Alps and Greece, including their final meeting in Paris in 1920, where they met Émile Siméon.In 1917 they wrote Les pharischemes humanières ( The Human Legato ) and published it in two volumes in 1920. In 1920, Birot married Charlotte Banquin and they began to travel and write, publishing several of their works, including Les pharischemes penitentes et penitentières, Les palmes sorores ( The Dead Palms ), Les sorores pensentières ( The Dead Sorores ), Les mortes de la mort ( The Mortals ), Les forgières ( The Gluttonous and the Gossip ), Le monde amitié, Les mortes nouveaux dans la mort, Les considérations pour un de vie ( The Considencies pour the Holy ), Les memoirs, Le mesures pharischemes ( The Poems of the Palms ) and Les solitudes septentrional ( The Solitudes on Seven Singular Solitudes ). These books and those of Pierre Teilhard constituted the foundation of Birot's aesthetic life.  
 In the 1920s he worked at the École royale de musique, where he attended lectures from Maurice Ravel, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Jean Marie Vignac, and Leonard Cohen.Between 1926 and 1930 he was at the Ecole polytechnique, where he worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and de Liszt.

Otto ( Ormandy ) von Langkäfer ( 6 December 1773 – 18 May 1842 ) was a German physician and zoologist.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Otto was born in Frankfurt am Main and studied medicine at the University of Göttingen. He became a private physician in Frankfurt, was promoted in 1794 to docent, and at the university was transferred to the neurology faculty as professor of pediatrics, initially in the Linz Department, but in the summer of 1797 was sent to the island of Gotland in Scandinavia. There he continued his work with Charles Darwin, and made many observations of the flora and fauna of the island. He settled in Stockholm in 1804, at the same time being posthumously promoted to professor of natural philosophy. He died there of cholera. He is most noted for his investigations into leprosy, and he was the author of several textbooks for malarial students. He authored a number of zoological and botanical works, and he was the author of two illustrated volumes on phytopathology, probably the first science textbook.  
   
   
 == Scientific work ==  
 With a very keen eye and a talent for navigation, he charted the coast of Zealand, and at the time of his death charted a coastline more than twice as wide as that of his brother. He was the first to chart Zealand in the north at sea, which was named after him. He published the first description of man's connection with the earth, and the first zoological catalogue of vegetation of Norway. He was also the first to observe Lake Nyasaland on 13 October 1802. He is sometimes called the first American physician to be sick with a tropical disease. In his autobiographical sketch, he remarked on the rarity of the disease in medical practice.Langkäfer was a member of several scientific societies. He also belonged to the royal family, and is also best known for his contribution to medical education and the development of a medical schools system for children in Sweden. He studied the life cycle of organisms at the University of Göttingen, publishing `` Grundriss der Mendel '' ( 1799 ) in which he presented the analysis of embryonic stages.  
   
   
 == Family ==  
 His parents were Carl Friedrich Andreas von Langkäfer and Ida Louise Bartholomaeus von Langkäfer ( 1766-1819 ), and Anna Catharina ( 1768-1836 ). After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he remarried to Marie Louise von Korte ( 1799-1884 ), the daughter of a wealthy schul-master. She had earlier married Dr Karl von de Beer and had two sons and one daughter with him.

 == Biography ==  
 The son of a Polish nobleman, Mório studied at the University of Strasbourg and the University of Padua, obtaining his PhD in 1798. After two years of lecturing on 1806 the department was opened and soon Mório had developed an interest in Lepidoptera ( butterflies ) and the insect collection of Georg Palaubens.  
 He started to work at his own expense on the analysis of Lepidoptera specimens, but died while building the Tabacăe lycophana, the insect collections of Palaubens.  
 He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Arts at the University of Naples in 1820.  
 Mório was a great supporter of the establishment of the Linnean Society of Naples, and of numerous Entomological societies and societies for natural history research.  
 He is remembered as the founder of the Polish Entomological Society.  
 He was the father of the experimental naturalist and entomologist Abigail Přeznieńs.

 = Sixto Angelos Moreno =  
Sixto Angelos Moreno ( 4 December 1936 – 14 December 1994 ) was an Italian mathematician. He taught at the University of Cagliari.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Son of a scientific researcher who worked in bioinformatics, Moreno joined the Faculty of Sciences in 1939 as the same professor there, and taught for the next fifteen years. After the Second World War, he spent some time in the United States with the National Bureau of Standards, which had been set up by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and was working on mapping America's nuclear program. As part of this project, he assisted Charles Giraud on the design of the first set of nine radar detectors. In 1947, he was promoted to professor, and, after that, to full professor in 1959. During this time he founded the Institute of Graphical Studies, and became a consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  
 He retired from teaching in 1982, and became the special director of the Italian Research Council. He died in 1994 at age 70, at the age of 74.  
   
   
 == Academic and research interests ==  
 Moreno was most famous for an application of Bernoulli stochasticity to properties of geometric surfaces, specifically the partial differential equation of state. He proved an `` auxiliary solution '' of this problem in 1994 by reducing the stochasticity calculus of these surfaces to an algebraic calculus of partial differential equations. This resulted in a completely different equation, assuming a positive mass parameter ( which it does not, according to Hermann Stumpf ), by which to set the value of the molar potential. This result is sometimes known as the Moreno-Stumpf equation. Moreno was also responsible for a chapter on univariate geometry, which is now known as the Moreno–Lefebvre theorem.

Matthias Hoë von Hoënegg ( 24 February 1580 , Vienna – 4 March 1645 , Dresden ) was a German Lutheran pastor .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Matthias 's father was Leonhard Höe von Höenegg , a Lutheran imperial councillor and doctor of law descended from old Austrian nobility . Matthias was born prematurely and so his health was weak during his early years , meaning he only started speaking when he was seven . His father initially had him taught by a private tutor until , once he was almost fully educated , he was allowed to visit Vienna 's St Stephan 's Stadtschule , where he developed remarkably and began talking to the city 's scholars .   
 Due to the imminent capture of Vienna in 1594 by the Ottomans , Matthias , his father and his brother moved to Steyr , where they spent three years and where Matthias attended the local gymnasium . His father then returned to Vienna and recalled Matthias , giving him a chance to attend the University of Vienna , where he initially studied philosophy . On the recommendation of an envoy from Saxony , on 16 June 1597 he moved to the University of Wittenberg , where he studied philosophy and gained his master 's degree , toying with going into law but in the end deciding to study theology .   
 After several disputations and lectures in Wittenberg , his father 's death in 1599 brought him back to Vienna for a short time , before returning to Wittenberg , where he gained his licentiate in theology in 1601 . In 1602 he travelled to Dresden , where he aimed to become court-preacher to the Prince Elector . After a trial sermon on 17 February 1602 he gained the post and also graduated on 6 March 1604 as a doctor of theology in Wittenberg . Christian II of Saxony then sent him to Plauen as superintendent , where on 20 April he was introduced to Polykarp Leyser the Elder .   
 Despite several offers of other posts , he remained in the service of Saxony and in 1611 , at the request of the elector of Saxony , moved to Prague as director of Protestant schools and churches in Bohemia . He then moved back to Dresden on the death of Paul Jenisch and replaced him as chief court preacher of Saxony .   
 His most notable work is his two-volume Commentarii in Joannis Apocalypsin ( Leipzig 1610/40 ) . His sermons and writings were strong Lutheran polemics against the Reformed churches , whose beliefs he loathed more than Counter-Reformation Catholicism . Older literature on the topic has overestimated his influence on John George I of Saxony and Saxon policy at the start of the Thirty Years ' War , though he was on John George 's privy council when it approved siding with the Emperor against Frederick V and wrote propaganda to support that decision .

The researcher Trevor H. Hall criticized Tabori and Underwood for selective reporting . According to Hall the alleged paranormal phenomena from the rectory were the result of natural causes such as various creaks heard from the movement of rats or the flying of bats in the house ; also , pranks such a local village boys throwing stones at the house or tramps trying to keep warm by lighting small fires in the rectory.Piet Hein Hoebens with Marcello Truzzi evaluated some psychic detective cases in prewar Germany that were featured in Tabori 's Crime and the Occult ( 1974 ) , concluding the cases had been misreported .

 = Edwin Fischer =   
Edwin Fischer ( 6 October 1886 – 24 January 1960 ) was a Swiss classical pianist and conductor . He is regarded as one of the great interpreters of J.S . Bach and ( particularly ) Mozart of the twentieth century .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Fischer was born in Basel and studied music first there , and later in Berlin at the Stern conservatory under Martin Krause . He first came to prominence as a pianist following World War I . In 1926 , he became conductor of the Lübeck Musikverein and later conducted in Munich . In 1932 he formed his own chamber orchestra , and was one of the first to be interested in presenting music of the Baroque and Classical periods in a historically accurate way . Although his performances were not historically accurate by present-day standards , they were for his time ; e.g. , he did conduct Bach and Mozart concertos from the keyboard , an unusual practice at that time . His interpretations of Bach and Handel were Romantically conceived , with a wide dynamic range but often quite compelling .   
 In 1932 he returned once again to Berlin , succeeding his great contemporary Artur Schnabel in a teaching role at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik after Schnabel 's exile ( he was Jewish , and Fischer was not ) from Nazi Germany . In 1942 he moved back to Switzerland , temporarily putting his career on hold through World War II . After the war he began to perform again , and gave master classes in Lucerne for a number of later prominent pianists such as Alfred Brendel , Helena Sá e Costa , Mario Feninger , Reine Gianoli , Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim .   
    
 As well as solo recitals , concerto performances and conducting , Fischer performed much chamber music . Particularly highly regarded was the piano trio he formed with the cellist Enrico Mainardi and the violinist Georg Kulenkampff , ( who was replaced by Wolfgang Schneiderhan after Kulenkampff 's death ) .   
 Fischer published a number of books on teaching , and one on the piano sonatas of Beethoven . He also made a number of recordings , including the first complete Bach Well-Tempered Clavier for EMI , recorded on the piano from 1933 to 1936 . Other classic recordings by Fischer include Bach keyboard concertos , miscellaneous solo Bach works such as the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue , various concertos and sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven , Schubert 's `` Wanderer '' Fantasie ( although he was not up to the transcendental technical demands of the finale ) and Impromptus , and Beethoven 's `` Emperor '' and Brahms ' Second Concerto , both conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler . Fischer 's historically important recordings have been reissued on CD by EMI and smaller specialty labels such as APR , Music & Arts , Pearl and Testament . Those of the Mozart Concertos K. 453 , 466 , 482 , 491 & 503 ( G major , D minor , E-flat major , C minor and C major ) are particularly outstanding , especially the last three with the inspired , powerful conducting of John Barbirolli , Lawrance Collingwood and Josef Krips respectively , in 1935 , 1937 & 1947 .   
 Fischer also accompanied Elisabeth Schwarzkopf in a renowned early-to-mid-1950s EMI LP of Schubert Lieder . His last musical collaboration was with the violinist Gioconda de Vito . During their recording sessions for the Brahms violin sonatas Nos . 1 and 3 , he had to go to London for medical treatment , where he was told he was seriously ill . He died shortly afterwards in Zurich .

 The theorem also asserts that the probability measure is unique to f.In 1911 , he formulated a relativistic theory of elasticity . In the course of that work , he obtained the vector Lorentz transformation for arbitrary velocities ( see History of Lorentz transformations # Herglotz ( 1911 ) ) .In 1916 , he also contributed to general relativity . Independently of previous work by Hendrik Lorentz ( 1916 ) , he showed as to how the contracted Riemann tensor and the curvature invariant can be geometrically interpreted .

Vassily Fedotov ( Russian : Адма́й Адоме́евич Ме́шов ; 29 May 1879 – 23 November 1969 ) was a Soviet mathematician. He was one of the founders of topology and served as Professor of Mathematics at the Moscow State University. He introduced the area of homogeneous groups in this discipline and pioneered the geometry of graph groups.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Vassily Fedotov was born in Chigain, S.Y. His mother was Nadezhda Leningradna Alizradeva and his father was an officer. His parents separated in 1898 and he moved to Ufa, Siberia, to live with his father. There he studied mathematics under Nadezhda ''s brother Eduard.  
 He graduated from the university in 1906 and joined the Chigain Agricultural Institute, where he graduated in 1913. In 1915 he graduated from the Moscow State University.  
 He was appointed Chair of Combinatorics and Semitic Linear Geometry and taught there until his death.  
 In 1917 he founded the Federal Institute of Topology, where he built an elegant topological space for a first model of a 6-dimensional Euclidean space, In 1921 he proposed the theory of homogeneous groups. In 1924 he became a member of the United Soviet of Russia.  
 He married into the Alizradev family, whose members held political leadership positions throughout his long life. In 1924, the family moved to the Ufa desert city of Yevpatoria, where Fedotov taught mathematics there. He also became a mayor of the city. He moved back to Moscow in 1924, to work with his older brother Eduard. His brother, Boris Fedotov, a renowned geodesist, died of a heart attack in 1924.Fedotov died in the Moscow Soviet experimental State Hospital on 23 November 1969, at the age of 71.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Fedotov introduced the concept of the intersection-member group, groupoids, and non-adjoint-groupoids to algebraic topology, supergroups and and topology. He developed the concept of an integrable natural group of L1 with a function ∅⁡, and the idea of index classes on groupoids. He proved that as a vector space, a groupoid contains a prime and studied the affine case for it.  
 He was the first to apply axioms of regular geometry to the extended Euclidean space, which made the conjectures that closed spaces had finite density or closed classes, and that groups had curvatures. He also took interest in the idea of parallel exterior corners, which is how geometry is often structured in planes, in regions which have an algebraic surface. In 1933 he showed that non-adjoint regions of a field bundle are orthogonal to the normals, thus excluding or at least decreasing the unpaired group-like graph. He proved that there exist a unique group of closed sets, G ( n ), such that it is possible to enumerate subsets of it by subjoining the subgroups of G with edges :

Leonard Urey ( May 26, 1918 – August 21, 1998 ) was an American physicist, chemist, and inventor.  
 Urey was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1918. He was a student at Syracuse University. After graduating in 1940, he returned to Syracuse to work for the United States Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. From 1947 to 1957, he taught physics at the Polytechnic Institute of the State University of New York, and in 1959 he received a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Urey was an early and important participant in the Manhattan Project, where he worked on the design of the first nuclear power plant in the United States, the Princeton Pile-1 in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1953 he and Mark Shapiro attempted to exploit the large number of plutonium isotopes, now in the ubiquitous pellet-source salt experiment at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to manufacture more efficient isotopes of uranium. Their approach called for the formation of uranium oxide as a reaction product, then melt forming the characteristic p-type fission products. In this manner, Urey obtained the first billion-u-thesis ( Btu ) nuclear reaction. He also sought to reduce the degradation of thorium by using the isotope of plutonium. Urey was a member of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Princeton Physical Laboratory, the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, and the National Academy of Sciences. He helped to establish the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a prominent research organization in the United States. Urey was a co-editor of the Journal of Nuclear Physics, published by Elsevier, and served as chairman of the physics section at the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He was the first president of the American Physical Society. He received the Byron Culbertson Medal for Scientific Achievement, the Alexander Graham Bell Award, the Ruhm Medal, the Gold Medal of the American Physical Society, and the Caldecott Medal of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers.After retiring from the Princeton Physics Department in 1980, he co-founded, along with George MacDonald, Nuclear Power Planning & Administration, Inc., a consulting firm that provides advice to companies on problems in nuclear energy and security, and was also a consultant to the defense contractor Lockheed. In 1985, he became President of X-Rays Unlimited, a consulting firm based in Louisville, Kentucky.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 Urey died in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on August 21, 1998, aged 93. In 2005, he was inducted into the National Nuclear Security Administration Hall of Fame, with the following citation :  
   
 `` Urey's ability to forge a solid point atom remained with us for decades. His initial results suggested that the initial bombardment of uranium atoms might be an important starting point for the next generation of atomic bombs. Urey's lab study also produced the first evidence of the plutonium–uranium bond, the fundamental bond-formation step in fission. He and his colleagues'achievement resulted in the manufacture of more than 1 billion U-235 isotopes through the process known as fission. More important, he was able to understand that the elimination of these isotopes would have the potential to enable the commercial production of even more enriched uranium. ''

 = Arthur Weyland =  
Sir Arthur John Weyland, Rector of Magdalen, Suffolk ( 20 October 1844 – 18 January 1919 ) was an English mathematician and physicist, who developed the Weyland-Koch theory.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Weyland was born on 20 October 1844 in Newton-le-Saux, a settlement of a Welsh family from Ynys Môn, Hardwic Castle, North Wales. His father was a judge in the Newcastle Coroner's Court. He married Catherine Abney Kingon, the daughter of a rich Belfast shipping company officer, on 29 April 1870, in Wakefield Chapel, Belfast. Their children were Arthur Francis ( 1872–1953 ), an officer in the Admiralty, and Gwendolen Mary ( 1872–1929 ). Arthur became an Anglican and then a Roman Catholic, during World War I, he was part of a small group of Catholics who were sacked from their Belfast barracks in 1918 and subsequently imprisoned in Lunaclar. They were released in 1919 when British forces were defeated in Ireland. Arthur and Gwendolen, unlike most of the refugees, were not severely mistreated and were given homes and privileges as Jews. Arthur and Gwendolen were supported by their youngest son, Sir Arthur Nimmo, who was an amateur astronomer and astronomer-astronomer who became one of Weyland's closest friends.  
 Sir Arthur became headmaster of St. Michael's Collegiate School in Lunaclar, North Wales, when Arthur was 8, and took up the position of Superintendent of Schools in 1892. He was heavily involved in research at nearby Lunaclar Observatory and led all British astronomers and astronomers who visited there until 1918. In 1907, he designed the tower, which houses the Lunaclar Observatory, as the Hoyle Hall.In 1910, Weyland was selected to take charge of the University of Cambridge's Department of Physics, succeeding Sir Charles Sanders. He appointed himself head of Cambridge's physics department, and made a number of important contributions in the field. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1914, and became one of its first `` generation '' ( 1890–1925 ).Weyland and Sir Charles Sanders established two founding institutions : one in Cambridge's Durham Campus, and another in Cambridge's King's College. Their legacy of mathematics and physics education remains a potent force in modern British universities, however, and the achievement of Weyland-Sanders's three fundamental scientific contributions led to important advances in science education. The laboratory became a central part of science and technology education at Cambridge, and the Weyland–Sanders–Mann laws were named for him.  
 In 1924, he became dean of Trinity College, Cambridge, and was known as `` The Dean Who Prescribes the Terms ''. He wrote on the history of mathematics in general and modern physics in particular. As headmaster at Cambridge, he was made chancellor in 1935, and became head of the physics department, with responsibility for Physics Department, in 1945, when James Callaghan stepped down. He spent his last years in Cambridge, retiring in 1945, but living in exile in Holborn.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
 He received a Certificate of Honour, and in 1918 his proposers were Lord Lyell and Lord Haviland. In 1918 he was elected President of the Royal Society. His proposers were John Wesley, George Madigan, Norman Polkinghorne, William Wright and David Collie. He was one of the `` founding fathers '' of the Mathematical Association of Great Britain, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.Sir Arthur weyland endowed the Weyland-Koch Lecture at Cambridge in 1919.

 = Otis Dudley Duncan =   
Otis Dudley Duncan ( December 2 , 1921 in Nocona , Texas – November 16 , 2004 , in Santa Barbara , California ) was `` the most important quantitative sociologist in the world in the latter half of the 20th century '' , according to sociologist Leo Goodman . His book The American Occupational Structure , which received the American Sociological Association 's Sorokin Award , documented how parents transmit their societal status to their children . Duncan compiled his thoughts on the major issues of the field into Notes on Social Measurement , which he considered his greatest work .   
 One of the most influential sociologists in history , Otis Dudley Duncan was instrumental in transforming mainstream American sociology into a quantitatively based empirical social science in the second half of the twentieth century . His key scholarly contributions include the introduction of path analysis to sociology ; the measurement of occupational socioeconomic standing with an index ( Duncan Socioeconomic Index ) ; the study of intergenerational occupational mobility ; the spatial analysis of residential patterns ; the application and advancement of log-linear models and Rasch models for categorical social science data ; and a landmark treatise on social measurement ( Duncan 1984 ) .   
 Duncan ’ s best known work is a 1967 book that he coauthored with Peter Blau , The American Occupational Structure . Based on quantitative analyses of the first large national survey of social mobility in the United States , the book elegantly depicts the process by which parents transmit their social standing to their children , particularly through affecting the children ’ s education . The book ’ s impact went far beyond its analyses of occupational mobility . Using survey data and statistical techniques , it showed how an important sociological topic could be analyzed effectively and rigorously with appropriate quantitative methods . The work helped inspire a new generation of sociologists to pursue quantitative sociology . Today a worldwide community of sociologists specializing in social stratification and social mobility still work on elaborating the Blau-Duncan model to include such additional factors as cognitive ability , race , and social context in studying the transmission of social standing from one generation to the next .   
 Duncan retired in 1987 , taking up pursuits such as composing electronic music and computer graphics . In 2000 he joined his local Humanist Society which led him to publish new work on the prevalence of creationism , tolerance of atheists , support for euthanasia and other such issues .

Gyldendal ( 1476–1555 ) was a Danish pastor of the Friarhood of Gothenburg. He was from a long line of theologians who believed in the doctrine of transubstantiation, a teaching which had gained popularity in the late 14th century.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born at Kemper in Fledermaey ( today in Sweden ), the third of seven children of the Rev. Ulf ( 1284–1318 ), clergyman and Bishop of Göthe and of Famils Johan Peter Gethvink and Juranene Skøllman. He was educated at the middle school in Gothenburg, where he also took a degree in arts and literature. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1535 and went on pastoral service at Canstedt ( 1553–1564 ), where he also met and befriended the great German theologian Jacobus Möhler.  
 In 1553, he was ordained a deacon and took up the post of pastor of a congregation in Westerwooly ( now Kemper ). In 1557, he was elected professor at Gothenburg Cathedral ( later Gothenburg University ) and became a close associate of Möhler.  
 Möhler made a study of some of the doctrines of both Abraham and St. Paul in order to clarify the teaching of his opponent, Paul Tillich, who was himself a theological believer in transubstantiation. During his time in Gothenburg, he founded a school of theology, became acquainted with Johann Tietze and Johannes Heinrich Hahn and with Carl John Heyboer. On 13 March 1556, he became Bishop of Gothenburg. He was the founder of the Synod of Dort, which in the modern sense is the principal body of theologians of Gothenburg. From 1561 until 1573, he was the Sætera of Sweden. He became a German Orthodox bishop.  
 For many years he lived with his wife Johanna, daughter of Fr. Edward E. Skallberg. She died in 1582. He had four children, who later lived in China and in the United States.

Charles Bellisson, born A.C.P.W. in Argyll, Glamorganshire, died in Manchester on 8 September 1930, aged 81, was an Irish archaeologist who studied at Manchester and at Swansea. He is generally known for studies of the sites of ancient civilization, particularly with regards to Bran Barr.Bellisson worked for the Natural History Museum and Staffordshire Academy from 1920 until 1923 and worked for the National Museum from 1925 until 1935.A large part of his published research dealt with the architecture and material culture of Britain prior to 500 BC. His principal works were about the site of Bran Barr, Aberystwyth in Scotland, both in connection with prehistoric archaeology and prehistoric materials.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Bellisson was born in Aberystwyth, near here, son of Joseph Breen ( 1810-1883 ) and Rosamund ( roman ; 1803–1875 ). The house had belonged to the family of Sarah Burmeister Fife, in the village of Aberystwyth ( which, despite being part of Aberystwyth was technically the north end of Lochhead Bay, across the English Channel ), for whom it was called Lindoanorn on receiving the genealogy document in 1871. The family had a property adjacent to the rectory ( when Breen died in 1891 ), and he lived at this house until his mother died in 1880. Bellisson was educated in schools from an early age. His father passed away in 1847, the oldest son remaining in education till he turned sixteen.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 From 1881 he studied at Staffordshire College ( 1881–1884 ) and then Merton College, Cambridge ( 1886–1892 ), as well as attending the University of Oxford from 1892 to 1896. From 1897 to 1902 he spent a year as lecturer at the University of Manchester ( now Manchester Metropolitan University ). There he was involved in ethnographic research and anthropology, working in the fields of sculpture and pottery. Bellisson travelled extensively throughout the United Kingdom with such publications as The Celtic Knot ( 1898 ) and Memories of the Great Migration ( 1902 ), which put him at the centre of British interest in the Anglo-Saxon period. He had an ongoing contact with the archaeology of France and Belgium, particularly the sites of Côte d'Azur, and in 1903 he founded the Côte d'Azur Archaeological Society ( CaAZURA ) with the aim of finding a solution to a tributary problem in relation to both Periplus IV and Periplus V, even if it meant destroying the Basque village of Nuñez the place most closely related to the pre-Aryan Crete. In 1907, in Rome, he published I ’ am en est provocat de Matematica pecuni ( The History of Classical Civilization ) in which he proposed the construction of a theory of Classical Turkey based on Turin and Abydos.Bellisson wrote A Preliminary History of Celtiberian Life and Industry, which was published in 1911, and a history of prehistoric Britain, the one dealing principally with the place of Bran Barr, Aberystwyth, which was published in 1913.

 = Frederick Willibald Abel =  
Frederick Willibald Abel ( 30 December 1814, Sandweiss – 23 September 1898, Penzance ) was a Scottish physician and naturalist. Abel is best known as one of the founders of the field of botany in Scotland, although his achievements in that area would go on to make him internationally known. Abel was the author of descriptions of the Highland grass, the English alfalfa, and the tobacco plant, and he is also considered to be one of the pioneers of Scottish botany. He is commemorated in the scientific names of the Scottish alfalfa plant and the northern whiteflower, and in that of the English tobacco plant.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Abel was the son of a farmer, in the village of Sandweiss. He went to the university at Sandweiss in 1836, graduating BA in medicine in 1840, and MA in medicine in 1840. While still in the university, he studied medicine and veterinary medicine under John Campbell Morton, becoming demonstrator in 1846. He received his MD in 1847.While still in university, Abel married Margaret Maclaine in 1846, and they had two children : William Abel of Solihull and Elizabeth Ann Maclaine of Ayr. Abel died in Penzance in 1898.  
   
   
 == Primary work ==  
 Abel is best known for writing on grasses, especially those native to northern Scotland and Denmark. He described many species in the Scots gardener and botanist, Sir Alexander Grant Clarke in 1849, a botanist who had come to Penzance to teach at the University of Glasgow in 1824. Abel introduced, for the first time in Scotland, grasses to the literature of botany, especially the native plant species native to Scotland, the conifers.In 1856, Abel's wife had died and by 1859 he was widowed. Abel returned to Penzance to manage the Gardens of Penzance, along with his wife and their five children, but he had to retire at the time of the English Civil War because he could no longer cover the grasses. In 1869 he returned to the University of Glasgow, working with the chemist John Fraser Maclean and the botanist Joseph Wollstonecraft.  
 In 1873, following the recommendation of the Cambridge botanical journal, the Bodleian and Heriot botanical library published his Life of H.H. Abel. In 1875, when the University of Glasgow awarded him the Doctor of Science degree, he chose not to return to the University because he was still working in the Gardens of Penzance. This job, however, in which he made important contributions to grass research, became his permanent career.His description of Scots wheat as well as a selection of plants from various areas of Scotland were published in 1883, and he described the Highland alfalfa at the time it was becoming widely known. In the Journal of the Linnean Society, Abel wrote about these plants as being an important source for early Scottish wheat growing, since these flowers grow on the alfalfa on the medium-to-highlands of Scotland and Greenland. Abel had been a botanist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew from 1843–1845, and in 1889 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.His son Frederick William Abel ( 1877–1939 ) was a noted botanist and botanical explorer. He used the Penzance route to collect the plants that survived on the First World War, discovering many new species.

 In 1862 the field plant Stippus abeliana was named in Abel's honour, and Abel was awarded the Burrell Medal of the Forestry Society in 1883.

 = Carl Isbister =  
Carl Julius Isbister ( 27 September 1885, Brabant – 15 November 1962, Ammingen ) was a German Protestant theologian.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Carl Isbister was born in Grünefeldt, Prussia, to Julius August Albert Isbister and Clara Brühl, daughter of a landowner. After studying at the University of Wittenberg, he studied philosophy at Bonn, completing his doctorate in 1899. He moved to Greifswald in 1905 and became a professor at the University of Greifswald in 1912, where in 1928 he became rector. He became rector of the canton of Regensburg in 1934, and director of the Stuhl District Evangelical Church in 1938. He was also active in the state Evangelical Lutheran Church ( DZD ) until his death.  
 He first gained attention as a theologian after an address he gave at a teaching meeting in Mecklenburg, The Church, ( 1945 ), where he defended Pius XII's condemnation of Albert Schweitzer, whose repeated attacks on Christology had provoked violent riots in Germany. Isbister was convinced, nevertheless, that Schweitzer's writings on the good news of beatification would one day be widely read.In 1941, Isbister was one of the signatories to the Doctrine on the Christian Church of the Workers in Our Times, a document also written by Pierre-Simon La Rocque and G. P. Gourevitch. He wrote `` This Catechism of the Christian Church is of great importance to all Christians, because it needs to be understood as an outcome of a painful experience which has affected those who wrote it. This experience was forced upon the intellectuals of the past. But now this experience has become more important than ever. As the preaching of the saints has taken a firm hold over human thought, so the documents that comprise this Catechism are becoming more and more important to Christians today. ''

 = Dorothy Foulkes Thompson (anatomist) =  
Dorothy Foulkes Thompson ( 20 August 1884 – 12 May 1966 ) was an Australian novelist, archaeologist, writer, and evolutionary biologist. She made important contributions to both her field and field herbaria through an enthusiastic and prolific academic career.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Thompson was born in Brisbane, Queensland on 20 August 1884 and grew up at St Andrew's Road.  
 In 1933 she graduated as B.A. in English at Campbelltown High School. Her grades stood her for a year before transferring to Melbourne University in 1935. There she completed her thesis, After Australoid Echinoderms ( 1933 ), a study of an extinct British snail, Otolithes nigricans.  
 Having held a degree in botany at the University of Melbourne ( D.Sc. 1931, M.A. 1936 ), she published her first scientific paper on a non-human Australian mammal, Penaeus bezifera, in the Australian Proceedings of Zoology on 11 January 1932. A second paper titled Prehistoric cetaceans from the Warkworth Fossil Echinoderms appeared three years later.On 21 May 1934 she was appointed research assistant in zoology at the National Museum of Victoria. In 1933, Thompson was appointed lecturer in botany at Melbourne University, and in 1934 became assistant curator of entomology. In 1936 she became professor of comparative anatomy, and in 1940 she became lecturer in palaeontology. She continued with a major teaching activity for 25 years at the University, writing over 30 papers, and was an active member of the Centenary College of Science and Art and the Victorian Academy of Science.  
 In 1934 Thompson published her first article about Antarctica : the early evolution of the Antarctic cone snail, Otolithis nigricans. On 24 November 1936 she completed her thesis on the life history of the extinct British New Zealand snail, Penaeus bezifera.  
 In 1936, she travelled to the Far East, first to India ( Burma, then Ceylon and Ceylon ) and then to India, Nepal, and Burma, collecting thousands of specimens. Over her career she visited 70 countries, recorded thousands of hours of photography, and spent years `` collecting, identifying, and examining cetaceans and extinct animals. '' In 1950 she and the Australian writer Dorothy Parker jointly published `` Collections of Australian Morphological and Physiological Artifacts ''.These publications had great impact on the field of animal paleontology and the general public. In 1950 Parker moved to New York to be closer to the famous author of the books, Alfred Gregory Hicks. In 1956 he published his magnum opus, Anchor Cave. After she returned to New South Wales in 1958 she turned her attention to contemporary Australian archeology and anthropology, writing `` Companion to Australian Historic Preservation '', a widely regarded work on Australian Aboriginal art and architecture.In 1960, Thompson married Sidney Simms, an entomologist. In 1964 she was awarded the Victoria Civil Service Medal.After another trip to India in 1972, Thompson spent a month living in New York City with her brother. In 1973, she was given a generous grant by the Government of South Australia to come back to South Australia to lead an excavation of the Black Creek Lighthouse and the previously named Sloane Botanic Garden. Thompson was succeeded as acting curator of the Botanical Garden in 1986 by Patricia Davis, a woman whose field of expertise was in phycology. In the laboratory, Thompson performed work on cutting-edge forms of mollusc reproduction.Thompson was married for over forty years to Julius John Thompson, who died from cancer in 1986. Thompson produced three children. Following his death in 1991, her grandson, Kori Thompson, succeeded him as Professor of Zoology.

 = Margaret Susan Rogers (naturalist) =  
Margaret Susan Rogers ( 3 April 1904 – 5 November 1990 ) was a botanist and zoologist. She was one of the first people in the world to witness the hormonal balance changes that accompany ovulation and the onset of lactation. She developed the first ovulation calendar and pioneered advances in sexual reproduction research.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Born in Edinburgh in 1904, she came from a wealthy family of a sister and brother. She attended King George V's High School before receiving a scholarship to study engineering at Edinburgh University ( 1912–14 ), under Michael Hulsman, a teacher of William Loughton Bridge, who worked in engineering at Shell Oil, BP, and the oil company John Murray. She began to study at Guy's Hospital in London in 1913, but finished in 1914 without being able to complete her medical studies, and did not continue her training in microbiology until after World War I. In 1922, Rogers graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an Honours degree in Chemistry. In 1924, after her mother died, she returned to the university, where she was awarded a BA in 1928 and a MSc in 1929, graduating in 1930.  
   
   
 == Research and education ==  
 Rogers's research at Guy's Hospital led her to specialize in tropical zoology, specifically in the study of lactation. In 1928, she worked with then 10-year-old Alice Gregory, who later became the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize for her research. Rogers and Gregory became lifelong friends and fellow botanists. Rogers'first publication, on the subject, was “ Lactation '' in 1930.  
 Rogers married Leslie Stirling Rogers ( 1926–1993 ), who was originally from Ireland, and grew up in Westcombe, Northumberland, which she was influenced by, as a child of immigrants, to love the wildlife and natural beauty of the countryside. In 1932, Rogers moved to Scotland where she lived in a part of Edinburgh called Scotland Town. She worked as a nurse and fellow nurse. Her first medical publication, published in 1936, was on gout, a disease causing swelling of the brain in the days following haemorrhage, and it became an international bestseller. In 1937, she took up a job as a consultant in Norwich, and in 1941 founded the Zoological Society of London and in 1943 became one of its members. She was also a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( 1949–1951 ) and the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( 1952–1954 ).  
   
   
 === Feminism and politics ===  
 Rogers initiated the `` Sexual Biodiversity's Survey '' to gather information about the human population and to raise awareness of men's biological needs to reproduce. Her research became a long-term process of research, but the first successful seedless egg was created for study in her lab in the spring of 1946. This is the first proven case of spontaneous egg production. Her first husband, Dr. W. George Rogers died in 1951.  
 She was at the forefront of feminist campaigns, supporting a law protecting women from discrimination in medicine and the courts. She co-founded the Society for Ethical Culture of Women in 1949, a leading feminist organization. Her five child-bearing grandchildren include two Nobel laureates and a former president of the Society for Political Biography and edited several other journals and books.In the 1980s, she visited India to witness the puja system for women being introduced in a public ceremony there.Margaret Rogers retired in 2000 and moved to Cornwall to retire. Her living conditions were described by her granddaughter as being cramped and rough. Rogers died on 5 November 1990.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Rogers was a committee member of the Royal Society, FRCP, University College London, and the British Association. She was a wife, and a mother to five children, including Leslie, Jane, Torin and Noel. She was twice divorced, first to her married engineer colleague, Michael Gregory, who died in 1993, and secondly to her first husband, Leslie Stirling Rogers, who died in 1992. Leslie and Margaret Rogers had a daughter, Naomi, and a son, James. Naomi died in 1994.

Sir James Rennie ( 1794–1880 ), was a British scientist.  
 He was born at Bolsted, Cambridgeshire, on 24 January 1794. He was educated at Aberdeenshire Grammar School, and at the University of Cambridge.  
 He was then appointed private teacher at Sibyl Whitehouse's school, Middlesex, and at the Metropolitan High School, Oxford. He also taught at Calcutta Girls'High School for Boys in 1821, and the newly founded Kilburn School for Girls. In 1822 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Rennie was a discoverer of the wavelike `` filament-tube phenomenon ''. He explored the elastic properties of rubber, finding that the filament-tube inside was a much lighter and more flexible material. It contained `` elastic fibres '' that could become thin enough to be suspended in the air, compress in the air, and give way at sudden strikes. He went on to demonstrate that it was the elastic properties of the fibres themselves that made the tube behave the way it did.The magnetic properties of the filament-tube were improved by experiments on the propagation of electrical current by the object that was being touched.  
   
   
 == Influence on physics ==  
 Other influences of his were on the development of meteorology. In 1829 he published a paper that suggested that rain might occur whenever the sky was cloudless. He also published studies on the lightning that resulted when a storm struck certain geographical regions. Rennie came into contact with the geographer John Aubrey Fowle and the landscape writer and scholar Charles-Leonard Dix.He also contributed to the study of anemotropies. Rennie proposed that unlike erect or twilight stars, the locations of the stars would be very different during the day from at night. This hypothesis was now called the Rennie hypothesis.

He is known for his work on the problems of optics and motion , work on indivisibles , the precursors of infinitesimal calculus , and the introduction of logarithms to Italy . Cavalieri 's principle in geometry partially anticipated integral calculus .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born in Milan , Cavalieri joined the Jesuates order ( not to be confused with the Jesuits ) at the age of fifteen and remained a member until his death . He studied theology in the monastery of San Gerolamo in Milan , and geometry at the University of Pisa .   
 He published eleven books , his first being published in 1632 . He worked on the problems of optics and motion . His astronomical and astrological work remained marginal to these main interests , though his last book , Trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua ( 1646 ) , was dedicated to the former .   
 He was introduced to Galileo Galilei through academic and ecclesiastical contacts . Galileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri encouraging him to work on his new method and suggesting fruitful ideas , and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo . Galileo said of Cavalieri , `` few , if any , since Archimedes , have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry . '' He also benefited from the patronage of Cesare Marsili.Cavalieri 's first book was Lo Specchio Ustorio , overo , Trattato delle settioni coniche , or The Burning Mirror , or a Treatise on Conic Sections . In this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into parabolas , hyperbolas , and ellipses , and various combinations of these mirrors . The work was purely theoretical since the needed mirrors could not be constructed with the technologies of the time , a limitation well understood by Cavalieri.Inspired by earlier work by Galileo , Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the method of indivisibles to calculus and published a treatise on the topic , Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota ( Geometry , developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua , 1635 ) . In this work , an area is considered as constituted by an indefinite number of parallel segments and a volume as constituted by an indefinite number of parallel planar areas . Such elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri 's method . As an application , he computed the areas under the curves

Helen Singer Kaplan ( February 6 , 1929 – August 17 , 1995 ) was an Austrian-American sex therapist and the founder of the first clinic in the United States for sexual disorders established at a medical school . The New York Times described Kaplan as someone who was `` considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists . She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods . '' She was also dubbed the `` Sex Queen '' because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the sexual revolution in 1960s America , and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy sexual activity as much as possible , as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful . The main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most prevalent , worrying and distressing medical complaints of modern times .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Kaplan was born in Vienna , Austria , on February 6 , 1929 . In 1940 , she emigrated to The United States , becoming a citizen in 1947 . She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University in 1951 , graduating magna cum laude . She was then educated at Columbia University , where she received a master 's degree in psychology in 1952 , and then a PhD in psychology in 1955 . At New York Medical College , she earned a medical degree in 1959 , and later completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis there in 1970 . In 1964 , she initiated a unique residency program for women MDs with children at New York Medical College , the `` mother 's program '' enabled residents to be free during vacations and emergencies to care for their children . She was a long-time professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic .   
    
    
 == Sex research and therapy ==   
 A psychologist and psychiatrist by training , Kaplan viewed human sexual response as a triphasic phenomenon , consisting of separate—but interlocking—phases : desire , arousal , and orgasm . She concluded that `` desire '' phase disorders are the most difficult to treat , being associated with deep-seated psychological difficulties.Kaplan wrote extensively on the treatment of sexual dysfunctions , integrating other methods with principles of psychotherapy . As did many other experts in her field , Kaplan believed that sexual difficulties typically had superficial origins . She suggested that premature ejaculation occurred if the subject did not have voluntary control over when he ejaculated , and that coitally anorgasmic women should not necessarily be thought of as having a problem.Kaplan always encouraged people to enjoy having sex as much as possible . However , since the epidemic of AIDS into the United States from 1981 into the 1990s , she has had to add the caveat : `` If you are n't extremely careful , it can kill you . '' Kaplan commented that she `` absolutely hate [ s ] having to say that . [ ... ] I have spent my whole life devising solutions to people 's problems , telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful , but a natural function . And now I have to tell them , 'Hey , look out . You could die . ' '' Two of her disciples are Ruth Westheimer and Hans-Werner Gessmann , a German psychologist and psychotherapist , he introduced 1976 in the Psychotherapeutic Institute Bergerhausen her sexual therapy approaches in conjunction with the humanistic psychodrama and hypnosis in Germany .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Kaplan was married twice . In 1953 , she married sex therapist Harold Kaplan . They had three children , Phillip Kaplan , Peter Kaplan , and Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio , before divorcing in 1968 . ( He would later marry actress Nancy Barrett ) . Her second husband was Toys `` R '' Us founder Charles Lazarus . She died of cancer at the age of 66 .

 == Life ==  
 Lenhard was born in Reindorf, and grew up in the village of Studer. From 1893-1919 he studied at the University of Göttingen and at the University of Tübingen, and subsequently for the next twenty-six years served as an assistant to Eduard Robert Friedrich Wilhelm.  
 His studies in applied physics during the Second World War earned him a Doctor of Philosophy degree, and he also served as a visiting professor of the Institute of Mineralogy at Cambridge University. Lenhard received the Order of Merit in 1917. In January 1924 he was appointed as a professor of applied and experimental physics at the University of Göttingen. In 1933, his life was severely damaged in a crash of a tank driven by the son of a hen farmer, and he died of his injuries at a hospital in Munich.

 = Carl Ernst August Weihe =   
Carl Ernst August Weihe ( 1779–1834 ) was a German botanist and physician .   
 Weihe was born on 30 January 1779 at Mennighüffen , the second of 12 children born to KarlJustus Weihe ( 1752-1829 ) , a pastor , and his wife Anna ( née Rebeker ) . As he later described himself as `` Mindensis '' , it is probable that he received his schooling at the Gymnasium in Minden . Weihe was apprenticed to a pharmacist in Bielefeld , before attending the university at Halle , where he studied medicine and botany , receiving his doctorate in September 1802 . He worked as a doctor at Lüttringhausen ( near Remscheid ) and Bünde , before moving back to Mennighüffen , where he established a small botanical garden on land owned by his father . In 1822 , Weihe moved to Herford , where his children were at school , and where he died in 1834.During his career Weihe described some 160 new plant species . In particular , he made important contributions to the study of the genus Rubus . Weihe was the first to realise that the bramble , Rubus fruticosus , was not in fact a single species but a complex of similar species ; among specimens collected in the vicinity of his home at Mennighüffen he distinguished 18 separate species . Between 1822 and 1827 , Weihe and his collaborator , Christian Gottfried Nees von Esenbeck , a taxonomic botanist , published a monograph of the German brambles , Rubi Germanici descripti et illustrati , in which they described 49 species of Rubus.The genus Weihea ( now treated as a synonym of Geissorhiza ) was named in his honour .

Paštko-Obanov ( Russian : Аторо Ивашонович Оаностанко, Ukrainian : Аторо Ивашонович Оаностанко ; 12 November 1863 – 8 March 1943 ) was a Russian Russian physicist, mathematician, and engineer. His name is best known for an important work that he formulated in the early 1930s, but this work is often linked with the development of the wave theory of electrodynamics ( at the time it was considered its own discipline, and by the late 1930s it had become one of the most important physics disciplines ). The work became a major early example of field theory in quantum mechanics.  
 His work on noncommuting non-Lattice equations led him to develop methods of algebraic analysis. His many projects at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Leningrad, and his book Code-free Algebra ( 1959 ), are credited with popularizing these methods.  
 During World War II, he headed the Leningrad Physics Department and headed the Leningrad Nuclear Institute ( a unit of the Leningrad Academy of Sciences ).

 Tracy Sonneborn would later write : Jennings was so struck by the continued production of hereditarily diverse clones at conjugation , even after many successive inbreedings , that he undertook to examine the matter mathematically . As a result , general formulae for the results of diverse systems of mating were published in a series of papers between 1912 and 1917 ; these were one of the main seeds from which the whole field of mathematical genetics developed .   
 In 1924 , Jennings published an article in Scientific Monthly on `` Heredity and Environment '' which was prescient for anticipating the double helix , and provocatively liberal for its comments on racial differences and American immigration policy.Jennings was the recipient of the inaugural 1925 Leidy Award of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.After complaints about the documentary titled The Hereditarily Diseased , the Carnegie Institution of Washington appointed Jennings to review the work of Harry H. Laughlin at the Institution 's Eugenics Record Office , then part of what has become the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory . Jennings found falsified data and manipulated conclusions , and Laughlin was forced out . In 1930 , he published The Biological Basis of Human Nature , discussing eugenics , genetic influence on human traits , and criticizing simplistic interpretations of heritability based on Mendelism , emphasizing gene-environment interaction & polygenicity ; Sonneborn would describe the impact of The Biological Basis of Human Nature as widespread : `` Probably no book by a geneticist has been so widely quoted by American workers in the fields of education , sociology , anthropology , and psychology . In spite of inevitable misquotation and misinterpretation , it has exercised a distinctly salutary effect on those fields and is to a large extent responsible for whatever they have assimilated in this country from modern genetics .

 = Christian Grubb =  
Christoph August Christian Grubb ( 10 March 1535 in Stettin – 6 March 1635 in Münster ) was a theologian of the Reform of the German Reformation.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in the village of Stettin, the son of Thomas Grubb ( d. 1582 ) and his wife Caroline ( née Gläffer ), and entered the episcopate at the age of six, whereupon he entered the house of the astronomer Constantius Felix, to whom he frequently addressed himself. On the death of Constantius Felix, in 1582, he became tutor of his son, and was called to the chair of doctrine, afterwards ; but, in 1587, after having been elected vicar of Berne, he was ejected by the Reformers, and detained in Stettin, so as to be deprived of his clerical powers, and deprived of his offices as rector of the said college.  
 He was employed in designing and constructing the former palace of the Gymnasium, and in other ecclesiastical matters, and was afterwards one of the predecessors of Elias Münster, afterwards bishop of Göttingen, and bishop of Dresden, Dresden in 1607. In 1607, he came to Stettin, where his native birthplace, and house, and the famous church, were greatly loved, and are to-day still noted. The old German university, between which the Humboldtian and Ionic Exchange stands, was reconverted to Protestantism, and his choice of residence, he says, to that place, and of a great age, was a generous kindness of attention to piety. The teaching of the reformed school, in which he was the head, was eloquent, dignified, and, though ( he says ) somewhat oftener than is usual in a German theologian, in a good measure modish ; nor did he abuse the liberties of the professors, who ( at that time ) visited him and heard the more of his discourse. His study of Eastern science ( which must have been more extensive than that of his ancestors ), which, notwithstanding being principally Germanic, he sometimes showed in an oriental manner, added an admirably to the comfort and improvement of his companions, and was of consequence to all his successors.He made considerable private collections of Greek and Latin antiquities, and brought letters to the German statesmen and other prominent men of letters, amongst them Archibald Cumont and Jakob Prüfer, and some pamphlets on the history of politics, especiallie in Historia humano et cartographye. He had letters from the pope and princes to him, and also private letters from John Calvin and Thomas Foster ( afterwards Bishop of Durham ). Grubb was a patron of Luther's work, and also for the learned Jan Koßler ( 1609–1664 ).  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 He is most esteemed for the Revue sur l'évolution de la juge, libre et artificiel, opus locum ex pentate dilutione, which appeared in 1605, and was afterwards edited by Thomas Bennett. It contains four volumes ; in which is the full list of characters, of every science, of every church, and of every district in Germany.  
   
 His letters are on the ruins of a Gothic church of the Exchange at Stettin, in Germany.

He was taken in by a godfather who taught him a love of animals, and ultimately passed his eyes on to the famous American biologist John Reid. Reid wrote to Niles Eldredge, who brought the child back to the U.S. who considered the child an object, a `` dragon '', and asked for the `` fur '' of a mermaid, making the child a human and later renamed him Lestaka.

He made major contributions to the newly founded Journal of Egyptian Language and Antiquities . In 1869 he was appointed Honorary Professor of Egyptology , at Munich University and curator of the Egyptian collections.Some time later he began to be heavily criticized for the style of his writings . In the winter of 1872/73 he toured Egypt ( Cairo , Alexandria and Luxor ) which led to him publish some Travel letters , about his experiences there .

 His main research interest was schizophrenia. He showed in 1871 that epileptic epilepsy in a dog caused muscles to tingle, causing muscle paralysis. This was attributed to the action of the nerve ending of motor neurons as C3a1a. This finding is the basis for the psychiatric classification of schizophrenia.Cited as the first to be diagnosed with schizophrenia by certain `` excitable '' homunculi from the nervous system of a dog, C3a1a first became known in a neurology textbook in 1873, a work that made him the first to use the word `` psychoses '' to describe a character of intellectual or mental disorders.In 1862 C3a1a married his sister-in-law, Wilhelm Wilhelm Gebhardstetter.Among his published papers is a list of known antibiotics.

 == Life and work ==  
 Slingerland was born in New York City and educated at Pennsylvania State University and King ’ s College of the City of New York. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Photography in 1954. He started his career with color film, producing film prints with Leica 60mm and it 50mm  
 He then moved on to using still photography, designing a digital camera called the 35mm.  
 He founded the first corporation, Slingerland Photography Company in 1964, and a small company, Apertures, on the East Side of Manhattan, with a focus on slow motion and still photography. In 1986, he co-founded Parrot, Inc. with a group of friends and his wife, actress Fran Drescher. In 1995 he founded Slingerland Imaging which is a cloud-computing firm. A 21-year-old cousin was in the Slingerland family and co-founded a cosmetics brand, Stereophile Cosmetics, with his brother Jeremy Slingerland.Slingerland passed away on 10 August 1995 in Cooperstown, New York City, from complications from diabetes.

 Jessica `` Jessie '' Duncan was born in Aberdeen the daughter of Jannet Young and Thomas Duncan . Her father was a lawyer ; after his death , Jessie Duncan was raised at Clova , the home of her stepfather , Harry Keith Lumsden , in the village of Lumsden . When Lumsden died in 1844 , Jessie and her mother moved to Edinburgh . She studied geology with Alexander Rose of the Edinburgh Geological Society . As a single woman in her thirties , Jessie Duncan joined geological field trips around the British Isles , and traveled as far from home as Switzerland and Italy in her scientific pursuits . She attended the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Belfast in 1852 .   
 She married Charles Piazzi Smyth in December 1855 , and the two traveled the following year to Tenerife , to visit the peak of the highest mountain and assess its potential for an astronomical observatory . Together , the Piazzi Smyths traveled around the Mediterranean and Northern Africa , making astronomical observations , often in mountainous locations . Jessie kept the notes and sketches for their expeditions , learned to prepare and preserve local foods , and was otherwise a constant assistant to her husband 's work . `` Her love of scientific travel was equal to Piazzi 's own , '' notes biographer Mary T. Brück . She was also skilled at early photographic processes , and she printed hundreds of photographs used in Piazzi Smyth 's reports and publications . Almost entirely at their own expense , she and Charles sailed in November 1864 to Egypt and spent four months under canvas beside the Great Pyramid of Giza . There they completed the most thorough survey of that monument to date , backed up by photographs of both exterior and interior .   
    
 The couple retired to Ripon in 1888 , and Jessie Piazzi Smyth died there in 1896 , aged 81 . There is an unusual pyramid-shaped monument to both Piazzi Smyths , in the churchyard at St. John 's , Sharow , North Yorkshire .

In 1894 , Jose Rizal sent ( from Dapitan ) to Möllendorff ( who was in Manila at that time ) specimens of large sea snails known as tun shells together with some specimens of a species of small freshwater snails stored in glass vials . The species of small snails was later named Oncomelania quadrasi by Möllendorff in 1895 in honour of Don José Florencio Quadras , a Spanish malacologist who was also based in Manila at that time.A species of rat snake , Elaphe moellendorffi , is named in his honor .

 = Andr C3 A9 Martineau =   
André Martineau ( born 14 May 1930 – 4 May 1972 ) was a French mathematician , specializing in mathematical analysis .   
 Martineau studied at the École Normale Supérieure and received there , with Laurent Schwartz as supervisor , his Ph.D. with a thesis on analytic functionals and then worked for several years with Schwartz . Martineau became a professor at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis . Shortly before his 42nd birthday , he died of cancer.His research deals with analysis in several complex variables , where he introduced Fourier-Borel transformations for analytic functionals . ( For one complex variable this type of functional transformation was introduced by Émile Borel . ) Martineau was one of the early advocates of the theory of Sato 's hyperfunctions and gave lectures on this topic in Seminar Bourbaki during 1960–1961 . According to Pierre Cartier , Martineau played a role in the development of the concept of schemes in algebraic geometry by means of a remark made to Jean-Pierre Serre.Consider a quotation from the year 2004 :   
    
 A set in complex Euclidean space is called C-convex if all its intersections with complex lines are contractible , and it is said to be linearly convex if its complement is a union of complex hyperplanes . These notions are intermediate between ordinary geometric convexity and pseudoconvexity . Their importance was first manifested in the pioneering work of André Martineau from about forty years ago . Since then a large number of new results have been obtained by many different mathematicians .   
 Martineau was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1962 in Stockholm with talk Croissance d´une fonction entiers de type exponentiel et supports des fonctionelles analytiques and in 1970 in Nice with talk Fonctionelles analytiques . His doctoral students include Henri Skoda .   
 His son Jacques Martineau ( born 1963 ) is a movie director and screenwriter .

 = Luigi Denza =   
Luigi Denza ( 24 February 1846 in Castellammare di Stabia – 27 January 1922 in London ) was an Italian composer . Denza was born at Castellammare di Stabia , near Naples . He studied music under Saverio Mercadante and Paolo Serrao at the Naples Conservatory . In 1884 he moved to London , taught singing and became a professor of singing at the Royal Academy of Music in 1898.Denza is best remembered for `` Funiculì , Funiculà '' ( 1880 ) , a humorous Neapolitan song inspired by the inauguration of a funicular at the summit of Vesuvius . Neapolitan journalist Peppino Turco contributed the lyrics and may have prompted the song by suggesting that Denza compose something for the Piedigrotta song-writing competition . `` Funiculì , Funiculà '' was published the same year by Ricordi and within a year had sold a million copies .   
 In addition to `` Funiculì , Funiculà '' , Denza composed hundreds of popular songs . Some of them , such as `` Luna fedel '' , `` Occhi di fata '' , and `` Se '' , have been sung by Enrico Caruso , Mario Lanza , Carlo Bergonzi , Luciano Pavarotti , and Ronan Tynan . He was also an able mandolinist and guitarist , and for these instruments he wrote such compositions as `` Ricordo di Quisisana '' , `` Come to me '' , `` Nocturne '' , and several others . Denza also wrote an opera , Wallenstein ( 1876 ) .

Richard Alexander Fullerton Penrose Jr. ( December 17 , 1863 – July 31 , 1931 ) , better known throughout his career as R. A. F. Penrose Jr. , was an American mining geologist and entrepreneur .   
 He was from a prominent Philadelphia family of Cornish descent . His brothers were U.S. senator Boies Penrose , mining engineer Spencer Penrose , and gynecologist Charles Bingham Penrose , and his grandfather was U.S. politician Charles B. Penrose .   
 Penrose graduated in 1885 with a Ph.D. from Harvard for work on phosphates . Later , he performed geological surveys in Texas and Arkansas until 1892 , and then traveled the country as a mining surveyor . Most notable was his survey of Cripple Creek , Colorado , for the U.S. Geological Survey . Penrose refrained from purchasing or investing in mines in the Cripple Creek area because of what he saw as his ethical responsibility as a USGS employee , but did purchase and invest in mines elsewhere , including silver and copper mines in Arizona .   
 In 1903 his brothers and father were investors who formed the Utah Copper Company.After his father died in 1908 , Penrose made a complete career change , using his knowledge as a mining geologist to succeed as a mining investor and as an entrepreneur in other areas as well . Having amassed considerable wealth in these efforts , Penrose established the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America ( GSA ) in 1927 . Penrose was very active in GSA : he was elected as a Member of GSA in 1889 , served on GSA Council from 1914 to 1916 , was GSA vice president in 1919 , a member of the Finance Committee from 1924 to 1929 , and GSA president in 1930 . Upon his death in 1931 , he left a generous bequest to GSA , with the remainder of his estate after more minor bequests divided equally between the Geological Society of America and the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia : nearly $ 4 million went to each society ( approximately equivalent to $ 66 million in 2018 ) . The Penrose bequest serves to support the research grants program of the Geological Society of America . Penrose was President of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 1922-1926.Together with Dr. Francis West Lewis and Dr. T. Hewson Bachehe he founded the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .   
 Penrose was inducted into the US National Mining Hall of Fame in 2006 .

 == Biography ==   
 Balmer was born in Lausen , Switzerland , the son of a Chief Justice also named Johann Jakob Balmer . His mother was Elizabeth Rolle Balmer , and he was the oldest son . During his schooling he excelled in mathematics , and so decided to focus on that field when he attended university .   
 He studied at the University of Karlsruhe and the University of Berlin , then completed his Ph.D. from the University of Basel in 1849 with a dissertation on the cycloid . Johann then spent his entire life in Basel , where he taught at a school for girls . He also lectured at the University of Basel . In 1868 he married Christine Pauline Rinck at the age of 43 . The couple had a total of six children .   
 Despite being a mathematician , Balmer is best remembered for his work on spectral series . His major contribution ( made at the age of sixty , in 1885 ) was an empirical formula for the visible spectral lines of the hydrogen atom , the study of which he took up at the suggestion of Eduard Hagenbach also of Basel . Using Ångström 's measurements of the hydrogen lines , he arrived at a formula for computing the wavelength as follows :

Alexander Perthes ( 12 August 1784 – 25 June 1872 ) was a Scottish Lutheran theologian. He was rector of Albert Hall in Edinburgh, his son and son-in-law being Perthes ( 1772–1855 ) and Wight ( 1783–1872 ). Perthes was the author of the Edinburgh Universalist Episcopal Theology and Institutes, Edinburgh : An Historical and Sacred Vindication of the Universal Church of Scotland.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Alexander Perthes was born at Speke in the parish of Perthes-in-Cranfirth, Aberdeenshire on 12 August 1784 to Samuel Nicholas Perthes ( 1768–1847 ) and Lydia Helen Mary ( de Beaufort ). His father was the rector of St. Andrews and his mother was sister of Walter Fern Herd and niece of the Earl of Cashel and some of his other relatives. His brothers died in infancy, leaving him to attend the schools of St. Andrews. In 1801 he joined the London School of Art, London, at the age of 19, and graduated M.A. in 1807.  
 From 1807 to 1813 he taught at St. Andrews Academy and the University of Edinburgh, and in 1813 he became dean of the seminary there. In 1816 he was appointed chaplain to the cathedral ; in 1818 he was rector of the cathedral.In 1817 he was imprisoned for refusing to supply the cathedral chaplain with his Bible.He served as pastor of St John's, Edinburgh from 1817 to 1820, and also from 1821 to 1825 at St Paul's, Abingdon, to which he had become assistant to his brother and nephew Rev. Alphonse McDougall ( 1796–1873 ).  
 He married Catherine, daughter of Rev. John McDougall of Bridge of Allan, and had one daughter.From 1825 he was Presbyterian minister in a convent of Friends.  
 From 1839 until his death he was rector of Edinburgh University.As superintendent of the Theological Faculty of St. Margaret's College, Edinburgh from 1853, he led a period of excellent reputation, and this was partly owing to the brotherhood of his early years ( St. George Cathedral ).  
 His Views on Theology, published at 1814, and in 1825 The Universalist Doctrine of Religion, have much in common with those of Cornelius Van Til in the twenty-first century ; but differ on many points. For example, they contend for a distinction between Christ the Author of the New Testament ( whose miracles he denied ) and Christ who is not God's Son, but the Christ ( whose life is compatible with the Scripture ) ; they deny that Christ was incarnate in a person who spoke the Word of God ; and, on the other hand, they affirm that he assumed human form at the time of the Incarnation.  
 In 1823 he wrote Hymn, composed for the choir of St. John's, London, during the service on the Christmas Eve. The verses have been noted in Bl. He now shows signs of deterioration in health ; he died on 25 June 1872. He was married six times. The son of his oldest son was Dr. Alexander Perthes P.C. ( 1794–1865 ), 2nd Bishop of Dumfriesshire, and the third was Rev. James Francis Perthes.

As such in 1944 he was arrested and sent to the Nazi concentration camp in Prishtina , Kosova . After his release , he went to Tirana , Albania .   
 In 1945 , one of his brothers , the great patriot Halim Spahiu was arrested , jailed and killed by the Yugoslav Communist authorities because of his political views against Yugoslav regime and especially for being in favor of uniting Kosova with Albania .   
 Spahiu was initially a civil servant and among others , from 1957 to 1959 , he served as Director of the State Geological Service ( Alb : Shërbimi Gjeologjik Shqiptar ) . While a candidate-member of the Central Committee ( CC ) of the Party , in April 1957 he was next to Enver Hoxha , Mehmet Shehu , Gogo Nushi , Rita Marko , Ramiz Alia , Spiro Koleka , and Behar Shtylla within a delegation visiting the Soviet Union as part of the Albanian-Soviet relationship.In 1958 , he was elected for the first time as representative at the People 's Assembly ( Alb : Kuvendi Popullor ) , representing the Durres District . He remained such from the fourth to the end of the eleventh legislative period in 1991 . At the 4th Congress of the Party in February 1961 , Spahiu was elected a member of the Central Committee.At the 5th Congress of the Party in November 1966 , he became Secretary of the Central Committee and held that post until November 1970 . At the same time he was temporarily a member of the Presidium of the People 's Assembly , the collective body of counseling for the Presidency . As such , he was one of the members of the Albanian Government delegation at the celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of establishing the People 's Republic of China.Subsequently , on 23 November 1970 , he became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers in the government of Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu and remained in this position until November 13 , 1976 . He exchanged his previous post as Central Committee Secretary with Haki Toska , who served as Deputy Prime Minister responsible for agriculture , while dealing mainly with industry.At the subsequent 6th Party Congress in November 1971 , he became a candidate-member of the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania . He held this function until November 1976 . On 13 November 1976 he was appointed Minister of Industry and Mines in the seventh Shehu government , a post he remained in until 26 April 1980 .   
 In April 1985 , he was among the participants at the state funeral of the late First Secretary of the PPSh Enver Hoxha.Most recently , he was Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People 's Assembly and thus alongside Rita Marko and Emine Guri one of the counselors of Ramiz Alia.Spahiu was married to the sister of Reis Malile , former Foreign Minister of Albania .   
 He died on 19 May 1999 in Tirana .

Sir Charles Herbert Stuart-Harris ( born Harris ; 12 July 1909 – 23 February 1996 ) was an English virologist and academic who the first full-time professor of medicine at University of Sheffield.Stuart-Harris was born in 1909 in Kings Norton , the son of a Birmingham general practitioner Charles Herbert Harris and his wife , Helen Parsons . In 1935 , he received a £55 a year fellowship from the bequest of Sir Henry Royce ( of Rolls-Royce ) to conduct research at the National Institute for Medical Research into the cause and cure of influenza . The following year he went to the United States on a Rockefeller scholarship . In World War II he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Europe and the Far East , commanding field laboratories , ending with the rank of colonel and showing an early acumen in the diagnosis of infective diseases . He himself contracted some of those diseases he studied , notably typhus and typhoid.When he was appointed to the chair at Sheffield in 1946 the shortlist included George White Pickering and Robert Platt who respectively became regius professor of medicine and master of Pembroke College at Oxford and professor of medicine at Manchester and president of the Royal College of Physicians . At Sheffield , Stuart-Harris carried out research into poliomyelitis and influenza viruses ( the oral polio vaccine underwent its first trials at Sheffield ) and set up a major research and epidemiological unit to investigate respiratory illnesses . He identified the difference between influenza and the common cold , showing that several strains of influenza virus existed and that vaccination against one was not necessarily proof against another.He was honoured with a C.B.E . in 1961 and a knighthood in 1970 . After retirement he served as postgraduate dean for five years and adviser to the new Chinese medical school in Hong Kong .

 = Pierre Decleau =  
Pierre-Joseph Decleau ( 1 November 1889 – 3 August 1979 ) was a French physiologist and is best known for proposing the concept of the Caprice octopelagic as the central core of the entire herniation skeleton. This concept has been controversial for many years as Dunglas and Lappé have maintained that the concept may not be valid for this skeletal body.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Pierre-Joseph Decleau was born in Paris in 1889. In 1911 he went to the University of Strasbourg to do his medical studies. After a year there he returned to the École Normale Supérieure, where he remained in 1921.  
 Decleau is best known for his role in developing the concept of the caprice octopelagic, first proposed by R. Guébeau and later further developed by him. It is a model for interpreting the herniation skeleton. Decleau used a microscope to study the structure of skeletal muscles in chickens, which is a famous model in connection with herniation research. The idea gained international recognition, and was that of creation of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ), the premier research center of herniation research.  
 Decleau was a founding member of the French Academy of Sciences, chairman of the anthroposophic society, and one of the founders of the Société musculaire, both in 1894 and 1895.His contributions in herniation are noted in numerous studies, e.g., the volume Blasphemy Exposé d'absences par la paralyze et du sacroiliac les hénatiques in 1906.  
 A 1993 posthumous book on Decleau, La Caprice Octopelagic, became a classic of herniation literature and remained a favorite of this reviewer.

Peter Stoner ( June 16 , 1888 – March 21 , 1980 ) was Chairman of the Departments of Mathematics and Astronomy at Pasadena City College until 1953 ; Chairman of the science division , Westmont College , 1953–57 ; Professor Emeritus of Science , Westmont College ; Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Astronomy , Pasadena City College .   
 Stoner is probably best known for his book Science Speaks that discusses , among other things , Bible prophecies vis a vis probability estimates and calculations . The work is often cited in the field of Christian apologetics in regard to Bible prophecy . Professor Stoner 's book became widely known when it was mentioned by Josh McDowell in his 1972 book Evidence that Demands a Verdict ( revised as New Evidence that Demands a Verdict ) .   
    
    
 == American Scientific Affiliation ==   
 Peter Stoner was a co-founder of the American Scientific Affiliation , a Christian organization that describes itself as `` a fellowship of men and women in science and disciplines that relate to science who share a common fidelity to the Word of God and a commitment to integrity in the practice of science . '' The foreword to Stoner 's Science Speaks includes a partial endorsement from this body ( covering the book 's scientific content and prophecy probability calculations , but not addressing issues of Biblical exegesis or historical accuracy ) : they considered it `` ... in general , to be dependable and accurate in regard to the scientific material presented '' and the probability material presented in regard to prophecy . While the ASA includes members with a diverse range of attitudes towards science ( theistic evolutionists , Intelligent Design advocates , Old-Earth creationists and Young-Earth creationists ) , Stoner himself was apparently an Old-Earth creationist .   
    
    
 == Criticism ==   
 C. P. Swanson , reviewing Science Speaks in The Quarterly Review of Biology , wrote : `` ... the author has fallen into the commonest error of using only these facts which bolster his hypothesis , and of discarding or controverting those which do not . For example , his discussion of the theory of evolution is not only misleading ; it displays an abysmal ignorance of recent evolutionary studies . `` Various critics have taken issue with Stoner 's interpretation of prophecy . Stoner 's apologetic work did not receive critical attention until its inclusion in Josh McDowell 's Evidence that Demands a Verdict and criticism of these claims tends to be addressed to McDowell rather than Stoner , with Stoner 's name mentioned in passing . These criticisms against McDowell , Stoner and others include historical errors , claims regarding after-the-event authorship and/or tampering with Biblical prophecies , and disputed meanings of certain Biblical phrases .   
 Others who disagree with specific claims made by Stoner include fellow Christians and secular historians : for instance , while Stoner says of Ezekiel 's prophecy of the permanent destruction of Tyre `` If Ezekiel had looked at Tyre in his day and had made these seven predictions in human wisdom , these estimates mean that there would have been only one chance in 75,000,000 of their all coming true . They all came true in the minutest detail '' , others claim that `` the problem is that very little of this actually came to pass ! In fact , it badly missed how history actually unfolded '' and `` The location of the city of Tyre is not in doubt , for it exists to this day on the same spot and is known as Sur . '' However , it could still be argued that the boundaries of the ancient mainland city may have fallen within areas of the modern city not rebuilt in the present day .

Adam M. Ebert ( June 20, 1873 – May 21, 1937 ) was an American composer, music educator, and teacher, known for his operatic music and his cello concerto in addition to numerous chamber works and instrumental pieces.  
   
   
 == Early life and career ==  
 Born in Woods Hole, Massachusetts on June 20, 1873, to Louis Ebert, who died in 1871, and Natchez Pelly, an immigrant from Hungary, Adam Ebert was the son of printer William G. Ebert and Julia Lachway, née Nicholls. After high school he enrolled at the Lowell Institute of Music, where he won a scholarship for the study of musicology. After completing his studies in Europe in 1905, Ebert became an Assistant in the Department of Music at Peking University, where he studied cello with the noted cellist F. W. Willett. At Peking, Ebert served as First Director of the Musical Society, and attained an Honorary Fellowship of the Linz University of the Austrian Academy of Arts and Sciences. Ebert earned a Master of Music degree from the University of Chicago in 1927. Ebert served as Principal of the Graduate School of Music at the University of Chicago from 1927 to 1951, and was also the president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1946 to 1953. Ebert was also the Director of the Cathedral Music Society from 1948 to 1949.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After finishing his studies in Europe, Ebert returned to the United States. He became the assistant principal of Lowell University's Foley School of Music in New Haven, Connecticut, and was soon appointed Professor of Music at Peking University. In 1952 Ebert was appointed by then President James Meredith to head the Department of Music at the College of Wooster. There, Ebert studied cello, and began work on the writing of an opera, Oedipus Complexus ( The Oedipus ), based on the life of the Greek writer Euripides. Ebert went on to found and direct the Lyric Opera Company in Chicago, with other notable staff members including Milt Reasberg, Frank Suggs, Ed Burns, and Patrick Hass. In the summer of 1954 he performed the first of four Capriccio solo cello concertos in the Chicago community. A cello concerto was written, which was later performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra included Ebert on its tour of the United States in 1955. After his retirement from Peking in 1954, he played with the Wind Symphony of Cincinnati. Ebert was the uncle of pianist and composer Alan Ebert, and, in 1955, the three of them founded the record label, Chance. Ebert died in 1937.

 = Wendell Tabor =  
Wendell Tabor ( 4 February 1907 – 8 November 1985 ) was an American composer, music educator, and music theorist. He is credited as the co-founder of the revived music school at Haverford College, and was its first dean from 1953 to 1963. He wrote a significant part of the work of his students at Haverford, including Lewis Tichenor, Jeane Haskins, Paul Thode, David Welch and Mark Lehrman.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Tabor was born in Rochester, New York, to Henry and Alice Sieroni. He studied at Bryn Mawr College, won a gold medal in composition there, and in 1919 obtained his Ph.D. in music theory at Columbia University.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After taking leave from teaching in 1924 to devote himself to music, Tabor was appointed assistant music director of the Chamber Music Department at Haverford College. In 1931 he married Angela Johnson and the couple had two sons. In 1937 he moved to the Brooklyn School of Music, where he became music director in 1940 and was promoted to music director in 1942. In 1950 he moved to Harvard University, where he became the school's dean and music director in 1952. In 1960, he moved to the Carnegie Hall School of Music, where he remained until his death in 1985. In 1962 he won a prize for composition from the Society of American Music Teachers.Tabor was a longtime associate of the Haverford Chamber Music faculty. In 1954, he and John Munro moved to the new building to become the Sieroni-Tabor unit of the newly founded modern music school.  
 During his tenure at the Carnegie Hall School of Music, Tabor created an internal faculty awards program that gave fellowships to students whose work needed expanding. Other changes included the re-establishment of the Rossini chamber music program, and the addition of six new faculty members. He also made many courses more accessible for students, as well as giving them a more liberal approach. In addition, in 1951, he recruited James Gorton as its first music director.  
   
   
 == Haverford College ==  
 In 1947 Tabor was appointed the chairman of the school. In 1958, he moved the school from the Queensboro St. and Broadway location to a massive site on 6 acres ( 0.79 km2 ) that would become the Haverford College Quad, located just south of Harvard University. He named it after the Haverford College campus. He also dedicated one of the quad's buildings to the College of Arts and Sciences and one to the arts. The Center for Music and Theology was renamed the Sieroni Center for Music and Theology in the 1980s. He named the school an `` Academic Environment '' in 1969. The university named a memorial chapel at the Worship Center. He also named a teaching building for Jules Massé ( later Winthrop Theological Seminary ).In 1983, Tabor also established an endowed professorship in the life sciences, of which he became the director. Over the next few decades, he was honored with the Distinguished Professorship in the Field of Music and Acting as the Head of the Department of Music and the Social Science Division.

 == Biography ==  
 Jahnvors Jürgen Günter was born at Strasbourg, France, and studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Strasbourg State University and Göttingen University. He later obtained his doctorate at the universities of Vienna and Göttingen.  
 In 1939 he discovered the hemicron, which changed the structure of neutral atoms and the electromagnetic radiation field. Jahnvors later devised the Feynman–Jahn effect, which confirms the existence of the electromagnetic radiation field from a silicon atom. In 1951, he was recognized as a key figure in the realization of the crystal lattice model, although the evidence for this came only after he had published the D-P-Wolfram model.  
 From 1957 to 1958, Jahnvors served as a professor at the University of Strasbourg, where he lived until his retirement in 1964. He then taught at the University of Heidelberg from 1963 to 1966 and at the University of Bern from 1965 to 1968.

 = Guy Wiseman =  
Sir Guy Lucas Wiseman ( 16 February 1856 – 20 February 1941 ) was an English statistician, statistician and statistician. He is the founder of statistical theory, and was the first to propose that the speed of information flow, so important for economic calculation and security, is largely controlled by the dynamics of distributed systems. He also argued that probability was not a mathematical concept, but was more in the nature of `` the mechanism whereby information flows in a system ''. He has been described as the father of statistics in England.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Wiseman was born at Hayley, Essex, the eldest of five children of Richard Wiseman and his wife Julia.  
 Wiseman received his early education in Cambridge, studying to become a doctor. Later he studied at the University of Edinburgh, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1877. After he left for Edinburgh, he travelled to France, Switzerland and Italy, where he gave lectures on mathematics, political economy and statistics. After returning to England, he became a tutor at Winchester School and, in 1890, the head of mathematics at Winchester School.  
 In 1890, he became Director of the London Institution for Scientific Research, leaving in 1896 to become director of the University of Hertfordshire. This enabled him to establish the Encyclopædia Britannica.  
 In 1900, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, and received its Royal Medal in 1911. In 1922 he was appointed President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He died on 20 February 1941, aged 86, at the Radcliffe Hospital.

 = Alexander Bonfield =  
Alexander Bonfield ( January 13, 1842 – October 25, 1942 ) was an American naturalist and anthropologist.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Bonfield was born in New Hampshire on January 13, 1842. He attended the Eastern New England Academy. He spent two years at Yale University where he graduated in 1857.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Bonfield was an expert on the American fauna, although he never published on the subject. He became professor of anthropology and zoology at Boston University and later Harvard University, where he produced one of the best written accounts of American and European animal life in English. His three-volume, monumental work, The History of the Mammalia of the United States, was a landmark in the history of natural history.His aim was to take the wealth of scientific knowledge of the United States into a scholarly context, filling in the gaps in this knowledge in order to make a comprehensible, detailed, and informative picture of our animal neighbors. At the same time, he maintained a strong personal, social and philosophical relationship with his students, a relationship exemplified by his own and their devotion to one another. This style of development marked him as an extraordinary educational teacher who influenced the generations of American naturalists who came after him. As a scholar he was often criticized for being less concerned with history than with illustration. He was never particularly interested in other fields, and he was largely self-taught in all but one field : zoology. His best works described in a systematic manner the features of a wide range of American animals. Among his most important discoveries was the field of ornithology.  
 He began working on what became The Mammalia of the United States after the completion of his `` The History of the Mammalia '' in 1856. The vast majority of his work focused on, and was based upon, his knowledge of the American fauna and fisheries. His subsequent publications included the Field Notes to the Collections of North American Mammals ( 1860 ), the Mammal Genus : America ( 1868 ) and the descriptive volumes on `` Living Fossils '' ( 1875 ) and `` The Distribution and Affinities of the Birds '' ( 1884 ).  
 As an educator, Bonfield made a point of stressing the roles of both parents and children in their upbringing. He was the first person to teach his own children how to interpret and interpret in the way they wanted to see a particular object. One of the first children he taught the social psychology of learning to is Sam and his mother Pat Taub. Sam is the primary example of a boy who grew up in isolation and left home early because he feared abandonment from his father, a position he himself had.In contrast to the boy Sam, the many girls in his life left home early to pursue their interests. In his review of Ann, another of his great works, he wrote :  
   
 Who is the author of Ann? And how does this child come to know him as a father who educated him, and who nurtured him, and who taught him to look upon his accomplishments as significant and noble, and valued as he himself regarded them? It is about him that women finally gather to discuss the more recent field of `` sexual difference ''. He is the first to have awakened the warning voice of the father who sent the child away.

William Delap ( April 9, 1798 – March 14, 1884 ) was an American geologist who was the assistant of James E. Atwater, a leading botanist of the day, and a member of the Natural History Society of Philadelphia.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Pocantico, Ohio, in 1798 and graduated from Columbia College ( Ohio ) in 1802, as a free and active student. At that college he was associated with the prominent student, philanthropist, lawyer and mineral collector, John Curwen. Atwater had already taught him to read and write, so that when Atwater died, he found Delap to teach him. At this time, Delaware, was then part of the United States, as was Oregon, Washington and other States. Delap married Sarah Breaux in 1804. The couple had three sons : William Delap Jr. ( 1808–1871 ), John Delap Sr. ( 1815–1883 ) and Francis Delap Sr. ( 1826–1880 ). Delap later married Jane Matthews, a physician from Maryland. Delap died of pulmonary tuberculosis in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 14, 1884, and is buried in Forest Park Cemetery.  
   
   
 == Work ==  
 Delap is best known for his landmark paper, The Origin of the Delap-Klotzian Period in Oats, which provides one of the most extensive and accurate histories of the Ohio Delaps, Delaware Bay Limestone. He also published numerous shorter works, including a magnum opus, The Origin of the Beaver Flats.  
   
   
 == Achievements ==  
 Delap was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1808. He was appointed assistant mineralogist in 1809 and mineralogist in 1810.  
 Delap distinguished himself by leading the study of the natural history of the Delaware region, which was then impoverished by the absence of scientific organizations and antiquities of significance, and for his use of the geological information gained by the surveys to trace the mineral origin of the extensive discoveries and settlement of Delaware Bay Limestone. In 1816 he described the mollusk and crustacean genus Dreylichopoda. Delap is also known for his involvement in early American conservation efforts, which included hiring William Cabot MacGregor, noted author of an extensive collection of Delaware river specimens.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 A historic monument to Delap in Forest Park Cemetery is named for him. The monument is located just south of the Waterfront Association Center on East Eighth Street in Forest Park.

 == Biography ==   
 Río Hortega was born in Portillo , Valladolid on 5 May 1882 . He studied locally and qualified to practice medicine in 1905 . He obtained his doctorate at the University of Madrid by researching the pathology of brain tumours . In 1913 he was funded to study research histology in France and Germany but the outbreak of war between them forced him to return to Spain.He worked with the histologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal and briefly with Wilder Penfield . Ramón y Cajal discovered neurons , Penfield helped explain oligodendroglia . whilst Rio Hortega discovered microglia . which are the cells that protect the brain from infection .   
 He managed to identify microglia between 1919 and 1921 by staining the cells with silver carbonate . His method of staining also led to the discovery of oligodendroglia in 1921 , which both he and Penfield are now credited with . However it was Rio Hortega who named the cells.His discoveries in 1920 created issues with Ramón y Cajal , who led the lab , as he had earlier won the Nobel prize . By 1931 del Río Hortega was leading Spain 's cancer institute , but he left the country when the civil war broke out in 1936.War spreading across Europe found him in Paris at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital before he went to the University of Oxford to work with the British neurosurgeon Hugh Cairns . The bombing of Britain by Germany in World War II drove him on to Argentina . His escape was funded by the Spanish Cultural Institute , who continued to support him as he created his own laboratory in 1942 . Río Hortega died in Buenos Aires on 1 June 1945 from a malignant neoplasm .

Merle Randall ( January 29 , 1888 – March 17 , 1950 ) was an American physical chemist famous for his work with Gilbert N. Lewis , over a period of 25 years , in measuring reaction heat of chemical compounds and determining their corresponding free energy . Together , their 1923 textbook `` Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances '' became a classic work in the field of chemical thermodynamics .   
 In 1932 , Merle Randall authored two scientific papers with Mikkel Frandsen : “ The Standard Electrode Potential of Iron and the Activity Coefficient of Ferrous Chloride , ” and “ Determination of the Free Energy of Ferrous Hydroxide from Measurements of Electromotive Force . ”   
    
    
 == Education ==   
 Randall completed his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1912 with a dissertation on “ Studies in Free Energy ” .   
    
    
 == Related ==   
 Based on work by J. Willard Gibbs , it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an equilibrium determined by the free energy of the substances taking part . Using this theory , Gilbert Lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances . In 1923 , he and Randall published the results of this study and formalizing chemical thermodynamics .   
 According to the Belgian thermodynamicist Ilya Prigogine , their influential 1923 textbook led to the replacement of the term “ affinity ” by the term “ free energy ” in much of the English-speaking world .

Sergei Grechenko ( January 23, 1877 – February 16, 1936 ) was a Russian conductor and music educator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Grechenko was born in Chisinau, Kharkov Governorate, into an Orthodox Jewish family, to the composer and conductor Aleksandr Grechenko. Grechenko studied at the Ukrainian Schola Cantorum, the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and with G. H. Mogg ( now conservator of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic ), where he developed a teaching and pedagogical base. He was musical director at the Music Academy of Saint Petersburg from 1912 to 1919 and Director of the Second Conservatory of Music ( 1926-27 ), the Rado-Korezov Piano Workshop ( 1927-28 ) and the Moscow Conservatory ( 1929-30 ). He became professor of conducting at the Moscow Conservatory in 1939 and the director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory ( 1948-49 ). He was a soloist and at times choirmaster at the music festival Omsk ( 1949 ).  
 He was close to the Russian revolutionary resistance, and was a great supporter of the People's Commissariat of the Interior.  
 Grechenko was a leading figure in the development of conducting in the USSR and one of the most important pedagogues of modern Russian music. He organized a number of cultural events for the children of the Red Army, notably the opening of the Petersburg Conservatory Symphony Orchestra at the outbreak of World War II. He was also an advocate of young students, writing the program for the 1960 Summer International Contemporary Music Congress and collaborating with the arts education agency PUP, organizing the publishing of several lectures. In the 1960s and 1970s he also promoted the success of teaching music at the Technion and the Leningrad Conservatories of Music. Grechenko took a prominent role in the public life of Moscow in the 1970s. During this time he wrote several textbooks on conducting including The Voice of the Loved One ( 1970 ).  
 Grechenko's son Sergei Grechenko ( 1911–1980 ) became a well-known film actor, educator and composer. He was elected as a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Arts ( 1965 ) and the USSR Academy of Musical Sciences ( 1988 ), awarded honorary doctorates of jurisprudence ( 1966 ) and of political science ( 1972 ), and served as their Vice-President ( 1987–1990 ).

 = Giovanni Boscati =  
Giovanni Boscati ( February 22, 1790 in Cerni, Camerino, son of Francesco Boscati ) was a Sicilian composer. He graduated as a Musical Teacher at the Conservatorio di Cenno di Parma, where he also served as Conservator of Composers from 1794. He continued his studies in Rome where he was sent to compose operas, orchestral works and quartets, and cello concertos, but never finished a complete work.  
 After suffering a nervous breakdown in his childhood, he attended the Teatro Nazionale di Fiorentina in Rome. He then moved to Milan where he studied and received further training under the tutelage of Giuseppe Pirotta, who himself became one of the greatest composers of his generation.By 1796, Boscati had created some of the most influential choral and instrumental works of his era, such as the Boscati Cello Concerto ( 1798 ), and the Montt Symphony ( 1799 ). He was a part of the first generation of Renaissance virtuosos in Italy and had played a large part in founding the Milan Opera ( founded 1774 ).  
 He took over the business of publishing Fantasias e Saggi di Parma in 1805. In 1822, his wife Lucia Francesco, with whom he had three children, died and he remarried in 1824 to Giovanni Tommaso D'Elia, later the great Baroque composer, and gave his entire repertoire to Tommaso.  
 After three brief and unhappy relationships in his lifetime, Boscati resumed full-time composing in 1832. He composed the operas Segre ( 1828 ) and Cosiera to Leonor ( 1831 ), and the first two diatonic trios, the Boscati Sonata ( 1836 ), sonata for flute and piano, Opus 85 ( 1889 ), sonata for double piano, and Fugue di Sebastian ( 1851 ).

 = Thomas Sergeant Hall =   
Thomas Sergeant Hall ( 23 December 1858 – 21 December 1915 ) was an Australian geologist and biologist , recipient of The Murchison Fund in 1901 .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Hall was born in Geelong , the son of Thomas March Hall , a business man in that town but originally from Lincolnshire , England and Elizabeth , née Walshe , from Dublin . Hall was educated at the Geelong Grammar School where he came under the influence of James L. Cuthbertson . He was a junior master at Wesley College in 1879-80 , then Hawthorn College and then went to the University of Melbourne , where he took his B.A . degree in 1886 with honours in natural science . This included work in palaeontology under Sir Frederick McCoy . Hall taught for a year at Girton College , Sandhurst ( now Bendigo ) in 1887 , but returned to the university and did a three years ' course in biology under Professor Sir Baldwin Spencer .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Hall took a leading part in the forming of the university science club , and through it met Dr G. B. Pritchard with whom he was later to do valuable work in geology . Hall was a successful director of the Castlemaine school of mines from 1890 to 1893 , and in the latter year became lecturer in biology at Melbourne university . Hall held this position until his death but found time for many other activities .   
 In 1899 Hall published a Catalogue of the Scientific and Technical Periodical Literature in the Libraries of Victoria . A second and enlarged edition , in which he was assisted by Mr E. R. Pitt of the public library , Melbourne , appeared in 1911 . He did much valuable work for the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria ( president 1901–1903 ) , the Royal Society of Victoria , and the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science . His Victorian Hill and Dale ( 1909 ) , describing the geology of the country around Melbourne , is a model book of popular science , written without a trace of scientific jargon ; there is barely a technical term in its 150 pages . He did not write a large number of papers , but his work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria led to his being made the recipient of The Murchison Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1901 . One of his major discoveries was the key to the unravelling of the complex Ordovician sequence .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Hall became ill early in 1915 , but courageously carried on his work until shortly before his death from chronic nephritis on 21 December 1915 . He married Miss Eva Lucie Annie Hill on 21 December 1891 , who survived him along with three sons and a daughter . He was given the honorary degree of D.Sc . by Melbourne university in 1908 .   
 Dr Hall was a good example of the hard-working man of science , giving much time to matters of routine , and yet contriving to do original and important work in one or more directions . Hall 's work with Dr Pritchard on the tertiary fossiliferous strata of Victoria , and his own work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria gives him a permanent place in the history of Australian geology .

 = Thomas Michael Donahue =   
Thomas Michael Donahue ( 23 May 1921 , Healdton , Oklahoma – 16 October 2004 , Ann Arbor , Michigan ) was an American physicist , astronomer , and space and planetary scientist .   
 Donahue graduated in 1942 from Rockhurst College in Kansas City and received in 1947 his PhD in physics from Johns Hopkins University , with an interruption of his graduate studies by WW II and service in the Army Signal Corps .   
    
 After three years as a post-doctoral research associate and assistant professor at Hopkins , Tom joined the University of Pittsburgh Physics Department in 1951 . At Pittsburgh he organized an atomic physics and atmospheric science program that led to experimental and theoretical studies of the upper atmosphere of the Earth and other solar system planets with instruments flown on sounding rockets and spacecraft . He became Professor of Physics in 1959 and eventually Director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Sciences and the Space Research Coordination Center at the University . In 1960 he spent a sabbatical year on a Guggenheim Fellowship at the Service d'Aeronomie in Paris , which began collaborations with French colleagues that flourished for more than 40 years . In 1974 he became the Chairman of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Department , University of Michigan , a position he held until 1981 .   
 According to the Fall 2004 newsletter of the University of Michigan 's Department of Atmospheric , Oceanic and Space Sciences , Donahue said :   
    
 I want to know how the planets of the solar system were formed , how they came to evolve as they did and the significance of all that for the existence of life in the solar system and in rest of the universe .   
 He was Chairman of the Committee on Public Policy of the American Geophysical Union and authored more than 200 research publications . Tom 's influence in space exploration spanned many decades and diverse projects . He was an experimenter or interdisciplinary scientist on the orbiting Geophysical Observatory Missions , Apollo-17 , Apollo-Soyuz , Voyager , Pioneer Venus Multiprobe and Orbiter , Galileo , Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby , and Cassini . Based on observations by the Pioneer Venus entry probe , he concluded that Venus once had an ocean before a runaway greenhouse effect led to its current state . Analyzing similar data from Martian meteorites , he again argued for a substantial Martian ocean , anticipating the current series of missions to Mars . In these and many other cases he laid the foundation for our current understanding of planetary atmospheres .   
 In 1999 , Tom described his career this way , `` I parlayed my training in atomic physics into a faculty position at Pitt , doing research in aeronomy and laboratory studies of atomic physics . This led to rocket and satellite exploration of the upper atmosphere of Earth in the 60s and spacecraft exploration of Mars , Venus and the Outer Planets beginning in the 70s . Along the way my students , post-docs and I were deeply involved in the problem of anthropogenic destruction of the stratospheric ozone in the early 70s . This led to my continuing interest in global change . ''   
    
 Upon his death , he was survived by his wife , three sons , and six grandchildren .

 = Hugo von Seeliger =   
Hugo von Seeliger ( 23 September 1849 – 2 December 1924 ) , also known as Hugo Hans Ritter von Seeliger , was a German astronomer , often considered the most important astronomer of his day .   
 He was born in Biala , completed high school in Teschen in 1867 , and studied at the Universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig . He earned a doctorate in astronomy in 1872 from the latter , studying under Carl Christian Bruhns . He was on the staff of the University of Bonn Observatory until 1877 , as an assistant to Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander . In 1874 , he directed the German expedition to the Auckland Islands to observe the transit of Venus . In 1881 , he became the Director of the Gotha Observatory , and in 1882 became a Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory at the University of Munich , which post he held until his death . His students included Hans Kienle , Ernst Anding , Julius Bauschinger , Paul ten Bruggencate , Gustav Herglotz , Richard Schorr , and especially Karl Schwarzschild , who earned a doctorate under him in 1898 , and acknowledged Seeliger 's influence in speeches throughout his career .   
 Seeliger was elected an Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1892 , and President of the Astronomische Gesellschaft from 1897 to 1921 . He received numerous honours and medals , including knighthood ( Ritter ) , between 1896 and 1917 .   
 His contributions to astronomy include an explanation of the anomalous motion of the perihelion of Mercury ( later one of the main tests of general relativity ) , a theory of nova coming from the collision of a star with a cloud of gas , and his confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell 's theories of the composition of the rings of Saturn by studying variations in their albedo . He is also the discoverer of an apparent paradox in Newton 's gravitational law , known as Seeliger 's Paradox . However his main interest was in the stellar statistics of the Bonner Durchmusterung and Bonn section of the Astronomische Gesellschaft star catalogues , and in the conclusions these led about the structure of the universe . Seeliger 's views on the dimensions of our galaxy were consistent with Jacobus Kapteyn 's later studies .   
 He continued his work until his death , on 2 December 1924 , aged 75 .   
 The asteroid 892 Seeligeria and the lunar crater Seeliger were named in his honour . The brightening of Saturn 's rings at opposition is known as the Seeliger Effect , to acknowledge his pioneering research in this field . Minor planet 251 Sophia is named after his wife , Sophia .

 = Friedrich Haasen =  
Friedrich Haasen ( 4 January 1822 – 9 November 1897 ) was an Austrian pianist, music critic and conservator of European musical talent.  
 He studied in Prague and Vienna, from where he graduated in 1843. He then studied and practiced in England and at the premiere of the Hungarian Queen Isabella II in Vienna on 17 September 1846. He wrote many hymns and librettos for piano music, as well as his first overture for orchestra, L'Eclisse pour raconte et à l'usage, with T. E. Longley.  
 In 1851 he returned to Vienna and established himself as a soloist in the organ with the choir of his aunt, Emma Beisel. In 1858, he completed the pieces for the hymn published by the church organ of Zurich, and he later worked on a piano version of this hymn. From 1867 to 1874 he was Principal Conductor of the first Vienna Music Conservatory, but he made a major attack on violin concertos in 1870 and the following year, in spite of this critic William Branum charged with sarcasm against Haasen and criticised the concertos. The one for organ he composed in 1873 with the Polish violinist Richard Theobald went through numerous editions and performances, but its own editor Otto Verneck felt it should not be issued. The finale of the first Symphony of the Vienna Orchestra of 1878 has been criticised as being staged, and a critic in Chicago quoted his passage `` In Rome so cold was I '' as being taken out of context.In 1869 Haasen moved to Munich, where he taught piano for two years and devoted much of his leisure time to music. His debut at the Berlin Music Theater was as master of the newly inaugurated orchestra, but it only lasted for a year. In 1879, he was awarded a professorship in the conservatory of Munich, and in 1880 founded the Vienna Conservatory of Music, which he headed till his death.In May 1892, Haasen was made a Grand Master of the United States.  
   
   
 == Honours ==  
   
 In 1870, President Lincoln awarded Haasen a full professorship of piano at the newly opened Richmond Conservatory of Music. In 1883, President Harding awarded him the US State Medal of Freedom for his substantial services to music.

Leonhard Wolf ( 28 May 1906 – 15 December 1983 ) was a German economist and historian.  
 Wolf studied economics at the University of Strasbourg, where he worked on statistical analysis of the per capita income of industrialized countries. He later worked at the University of Zürich, and at the University of Basel, Switzerland. He was named director of the Institute for Economic History in the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He died in Zurich in 1983.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Leonhard Wolf was born on 28 May 1906 in Dresden, Germany, to Leonhard Karl ( née Stelltler ) Wolf and Andrée Elisabeth Hengel. He studied at the universities of Göttingen and Freiburg, and completed his doctorate in statistics and the history of ideas ( 1939 ) at Göttingen. He taught at the University of Bonn from 1940 to 1946, and at the University of Greifswald from 1946 to 1967. From 1963 to 1974 he was director of the Institute for Economic History in the University of Zurich.  
   
   
 == Influences ==  
 Wolf was influenced by Richard Kiely. In their 1961 book The Relationship of Basic Income and Living Conditions, they discussed Wolf's approach to statistics and wage protection. They found that real GDP per capita in 1900 was 43 times higher in Germany than in Switzerland, whereas infant mortality and infant mortality rose at a rate of about 1.2 times in Switzerland than in Germany. Furthermore, German business people, in contrast to the Swiss business people, tended to be `` parasites '' in terms of the quantity and quality of their labor forces. As Kiely puts it : `` Of all the kinds of parasites, those who do not accumulate their capital in an efficient way do not show the least enthusiasm for efforts to limit their social deviations... Their and their families'life energy is concentrated. They can go forward only by throwing away the weakest ; they are free to gamble for the richest.... A more sustainable policy of a basic income is based on working people instead of corporations. ''

Johann Jahn ( June 18 , 1750 in Tasswitz , Moravia – August 16 , 1816 in Vienna ) was a German Orientalist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He studied at the Faculty of Philosophy of University of Olomouc , and in 1772 began his theological studies at the Premonstratensian convent of Bruck , near Znaim . Having been ordained in 1775 , he for a short time held a cure at Misslitz , but was soon recalled to Bruck as professor of Oriental languages and Biblical hermeneutics .   
 On the suppression of the convent by Joseph II in 1784 , Jahn took up similar work in Olomouc , and in 1789 he was transferred to Vienna as professor of Oriental languages , biblical archaeology and dogmatics . In 1792 he published his Einleitung ins Alte Testament ( 2 vols . ) , which soon brought him into trouble ; the cardinal-archbishop of Vienna laid a complaint against him for having departed from the traditional teaching of the Church , e.g . by asserting Job , Jonah , Tobit and Judith to be didactic poems , and the cases of demoniacal possession in the New Testament to be cases of dangerous disease . An ecclesiastical commission reported that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical , but that Jahn had erred in showing too little consideration for the views of German Catholic theologians in coming into conflict with his bishop , and in raising difficult problems by which the unlearned might be led astray . He was accordingly advised to modify his expressions in future .   
 Although he appears honestly to have accepted this judgment , the hostility of his opponents did not cease until at last ( 1806 ) he was compelled to accept a canonry at St Stephens , Vienna , which involved the resignation of his chair . This step had been preceded by the condemnation of his Introductio in libros sacros veteris foederis in compendium redacta , published in 1804 , and also of his Archaeologia biblica in compendium redacta ( 1805 ) . The only work of importance , outside the region of mere philology , afterwards published by him , was the Enchiridion Hermeneuticae ( 1812 ) .

 == Life ==  
 He was born in Pristina, then the Kingdom of Denmark, to a Christian family. He was educated at the University of Copenhagen and then at the University of Copenhagen. He graduated in 1928, and began lecturing in the humanities at the University of Oslo, where he became interested in Scandinavian studies. In 1929 he joined the Institute for the Study of the Modern World at the University of Oslo, where he taught history and philosophy. At Oslo he discovered another great rival for Nobel Prize for literature : Alfred North Whitehead, whom he met in the institute's `` Collegium Salonum '' ( seminar room ), later part of the University of Oslo. For his work, Peppenråds won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1933, and later was appointed Director of the Institute for the Study of the Modern World.In the early 1940s he studied literature, philosophy and anthropology at the University of Oslo, and during World War II he had the opportunity to work for the United Nations, where he did research on the mentality of the Nazi party.He died in the summer of 1979 in Oslo, Norway.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Of important literary importance in Norway were the works of Tolstoy and Umberto Eco, often published in libraries and anthologies. Peppenråds used the German pseudonym `` Hector Christoph Rückendy '', and described his work in his doctoral dissertation as ( Pseudepigrapha ) – a group of poems by writers of letters ( 1796–1918 ).His most notable work is Ørsted : Skovlag førner was meste nufba ( The Brooding Silence : Life and Influence of a Small Town in the Northern Norway ) ( Norwegian : `` The Snakes of Barents Land '', 1913 ). He also published a series of travel books ( The Home = Scandinavia, 1914 ), which collected his travel adventures in various countries. Between 1914 and 1918 he spent four months in the United States, from which he collected stories, poems and essays, becoming an internationally recognized prose critic.  
 Peppenråds had a deep understanding of Norwegian literature, which was almost wholly based on the poetry of Domenico Busoni. His writing was also influenced by the work of such Norwegian writers as Jonas Pertwee, Elisabeth Weyand and Bruges'Jakob Seysen, as well as works from Italian novels by Marcello Mastroianni and Raymond Chandler.He was the first professor of literature at the University of Oslo, and held a chair of English and European Studies from 1950.

In this role he began his work on arterial wave travel using reservoirs , elastic tubes and air chambers . These studies formed the basis of this doctorate in 1877 and were published in a 145-page monograph , Die Pulscurve , in 1878 . The key finding of this work was an empirical relationship that described the velocity of pulse propagation in elastic tubes . Except for a numerical constant this turned out to be identical to the theoretical prediction derived by Diederik Korteweg in 1878 and the relationship is now known as the Moens–Korteweg equation . In 1878 he retired from physiological research and became a medical practitioner in Goes . He was offered the chair of physiology in Leiden in 1885 when Hynsius died , but he turned it down . Willem Einthoven was subsequently appointed to the post .

She is best known for her development of the Chemli Learning Test and has also written a number of papers on related topics. She wrote the book Child Study with Linda Hawkins ( 1983 ), which was a critical review of Hawkins'work on the course, which was based on her own findings from volunteering and participated in, and which was eventually banned by the family courts due to its content.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Chemli was born in Budapest in 1918 to Rabbi Leonard Chemli ( 1903–1986 ) and Mrs. Helena Zoe Berg ( 1914–1978 ). She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1937. At the age of fifteen she was the first to enroll in the Pre-School of the Day in Brooklyn, New York.She then went on to complete a three-year study at the University of Chicago in 1939. During World War II she took courses in physics, physiology, and psychology at the University of Chicago. During her period at the University of Chicago, she also earned her doctorate ( Ph.D. ) in Psychology in 1942, and was later an instructor in humanistic psychology in psychology and education at Brandeis University in Boston.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Chemli earned her Master of Arts ( MD ) degree in 1949 and a Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD ) degree in 1953. She taught at Columbia University from 1959 to 1962. Chemli was involved with the third International Adult Study Organization ( IASSO ), a program of counseling and instruction for women and their children in Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Switzerland.She taught at Columbia University from 1959 to 1962. Chemli was an affiliate member of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) from 1958 to 1970. Chemli was the founding executive secretary of the American Psychotherapy Association in 1968. In 1970 she married her colleague, University Professor David Duke, who had a long career in the area of race relations.Chemli died in Nyack, New York in 2004 and was survived by her two children.  
   
   
 == Scholarly and popular life ==  
 Chemli wrote two books about her student life at Columbia. Chemli and Iasso teach a structured course in the treatment of infidelity in which individualized assessments of a student's degree of commitment to commitment are necessary to arrive at final decision. The course is described as a `` drinking game '' and is initially a `` test of individual maturity. '' It is designed as an initial tool for evaluating students and facilitates discussion with interested parties. Chemli developed the previous student learning concepts that later appeared in the International Adult Study Organization ( IASSO ) program. Chemli wrote and reviewed Chemli's 1968 book, Child Study, which became a seminal reference work on working adults. In later years Chemli became interested in learning and memory. Chemli has been described as an `` eccentric '' and `` cranky '' person who was a perfectionist. She also suffered from major depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. Chemli's first marriage to David Duke ended in divorce in 1977. She died from cancer in 2004. She was survived by two daughters.

 = Konstantin C-1 922 Czwaryszky =  
Konstantin-Nikolay Pavlovich `` Peter '' Czwaryszky ( Russian : Николай Фиха́лович Бома́вов, March 18, 1872 in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russia – October 2, 1956 in Moscow, USSR ) was a Soviet botanist, nurseryman, and educator. Czwaryszky was particularly active as a collector, growing plants in Europe and the Soviet Union. He grew corn, oats, sugarcane, and hay. He organized several national nurseries for Soviet agricultural needs in Western and Northern Europe.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Czwaryszky was born on the banks of the Ijsak River in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian Empire. In 1896, at the age of seven, he received his primary education at his father's father's nursery. When Czwaryszky was eleven, his father moved him to Dnipropetrovsk, where he joined the Sunday School group. At the age of thirteen, Czwaryszky entered the Moscow school of mathematics. Around 1900, he joined the Moscow Central school of agriculture, nursery, and forestry. In 1901, Czwaryszky left the Moscow Central school and joined the Petersburg botanical garden. His first paper was on the anatomy of wild ( e.g. peasant ) bulbs ( not in the new scientific naming ), on the physiology of the leaves. In 1904, he joined the scientific staff of the Moscow and Saint Petersburg Botanic Gardens and later of the Moscow State University. In the last years of Czwaryszky's life, he suffered from a severe case of tuberculosis. In 1920, he returned to the Moscow botanical garden, where he headed the collections and publications department.After recovering from the serious tuberculosis, Czwaryszky returned to the Moscow State University as a lecturer and for a time a medical student. He was soon considered the leading botanist of the Moscow State University, and spent his whole career there. He taught botany and language, and was the longest-serving director of the Moscow State University botanical garden.  
 Czwaryszky studied the genetic relationships of wild plants and those cultivated in cemeteries. He worked with trees, including his native grasslands, as well as with plants with flowers and fruits. He was an inventor, and patented an apple variety for use in cigarette packaging, the apple purée. He also experimented with curing smoked meat with alcohol and cured butane, the first single-use cigarette solvent. His scientific achievements were recognized by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1930.  
   
   
 == Selected bibliography ==  
 After his return to the Moscow State University in 1925, Czwaryszky worked as an associate professor of botany at the University. In 1928, he was invited to head the Institute of Chemical Analysis at the Agricultural Academy of the Moscow State University. Among the tasks of this institute was to study the toxicity and characterization of substances in plants, and he brought to Moscow the large collection of plant specimens he had previously obtained in Europe. Czwaryszky was to lead the institute's work on cytotoxic and cytological tests.

 = Philip Slughorn =  
Philip Slughorn ( 15 May 1907 – 29 March 1980 ) was an English Protestant theologian, professor of theology at Vassar, and advocate of a reformed Roman Catholicism in the United States. He authored The Catholic Tradition and the Modern World, and both God in History and a Critical History of the Church.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Slughorn was born on 15 May 1907 in Gloucester, England, the son of Philip Slughorn ( 1879–1938 ) and Marianelle ( née Jeffries ) Slughorn. In 1938, he married Elisabeth Julia Richards, daughter of E. Scott Richards, dean of King's College, London, who died in 1950. She died two years later on 29 March of that year, and was succeeded by his second wife, Clare Acworth Richards, of Mount Allison, Maine. He married his third wife in 1948, while still at King's.  
   
   
 == Views ==  
 Slughorn advocated an `` Anglican Tradition in the British Catholic Tradition '', of which the second half was preceded by a revised version, The Second Parish. He saw no need for the traditional Church to continue to adhere to biblical revelation. His first published work was A Critical History of the Church, in 1959. He contributed to many books and journals, and was a regular contributor to The American Catholic. While at King's, he was editor of the American Studies Review.  
   
   
 == Approaches to Catholicism ==  
 Slughorn believed that he `` understood the reasons for American Catholicism, and the Catholic theological reason, to be in the interdependent system of history of the church ''. Modernist Protestantism was a `` central aspect of Catholicism ''. Religion was always a matter of `` individual choice '', but there were good and bad reasons for joining and not joining various major denominations. An essential difference between traditional Catholicism and modern Protestantism was the justification of Catholic doctrine through reason.  
 He rejected the theological method which was used by many contemporary Protestants, but believed that in Catholicism the `` process of systematic investigation and systematic critique of dogma is... essential, and the process which yields a satisfactory judgment of dogma must always remain an act of conscious faith. '' Slughorn believed that `` faith alone, as such, can sanction itself as a reliable basis for dogmatic controversy '', and found in his early Catholic writings a `` higher level of mystery '' than orthodox Protestantism.Slughorn rejected the teaching of the Jesuits and the teachings of the Council of Trent. He instead supported the historic authority of the Holy See. He was an opponent of Ecumenism, arguing that all Anglicans need to engage in dialogue with one another. Slughorn advocated that the current Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John XXIII, be replaced `` on the present day or the appointed day, by a pope as said to be more just ''.  
 Slughorn identified with the traditional form of the Roman Catholic Church, with its insistence on the natural order of creation and that Jesus Christ was God. He called that form `` Anglicanism '', but later said it `` hides the biblical truth. ''  
   
   
 == Criticisms ==  
 The following is a list of some of Slughorn's works, in chronological order :  
   
 God in History  
 God in History : The Life of the Eucharist ( 1958 ), 3rd ed. 1959, Dover  
 The Catholic Tradition and the Modern World ( 1970 ), new ed. 1991. ISBN 978-0-486-48091-7  
 The Second Parish  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 During World War II, Slughorn was instrumental in planning the defense of the Anglo-Catholic and Anglo-Israelite forces against the Axis forces.  
 Slughorn was a generous patron of the Catholic Herald and of the Auxiliary Societies of St. Paul and St. Ambrose.  
 He was knighted in the 1960 New Year Honours.

He created his first impressions about the insects in 1893.  
 From 1894 to 1901 he was employed at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. He worked at the institute from 1897 to 1901, and was appointed docent at the same institution in 1902. Mortier's keen interest in entomology and the insect made him the subject of great interest to entomologist H. B. Nuttall. He was the de facto authority for the insects, filling almost all the key positions during this period. Mortier was especially interested in other animals and especially insects, and was able to write several papers about them. From 1902 until 1909 Mortier held the position of curator of natural history at the Museu de l ’ Institut des Noces Societaires-Massifs. He published various papers on the bees and was much consulted on the bees.

 = August von Kosciuszko =  
August Albert Kosciuszko ( 31 July 1903, Münster – 5 January 1997, Madrid ) was a German physicist.  
 Born in Münster, he studied in Kiel and became a professor at the Albert University of Munich in 1938. He then served in the armed forces for two years. His formal doctorate in physics was awarded in 1951 under the supervision of the physicists Hermann Heisenberg and Richard Feynman.  
   
   
 == Scientific activities ==  
 While working in Kiel, August and his colleague, Otto Hahn, predicted the gamma ray and neutron bombardments. August Kosciuszko carried out this research in 1957. The satellites of the European space research organisation Sputnik were observed by observing the fainter evidence of an extensive nuclear fusion process, subsequently discovered to be active. This event, which was attributed to heavy water explosions in the Sun's outer atmosphere, was later observed to be due to what was termed a `` thermonuclear fission '' or `` thermonuclear fission of plutonium-238 to uranium-235. '' He revealed that radioactive fission of plutonium-238 is occurring with an atomic weight of 240 GeV. This event occurred about 40 years before the discovery of atomic bombs and was referred to as a `` bang '' or `` nuclear explosion '' and had an amazing impact on both science and politics.  
 He became interested in particle physics after the discovery of the Bose–Einstein condensates by Wilhelm Wigner. While conducting his research in Munich, he demonstrated in 1952 that, by exchanging a positively charged atomic nucleus for a negatively charged atomic nucleus, a number of forces exist between them. These forces are termed `` the monotony principle '' and are the same ones which explain why objects ( including protons and neutrons ) behave the same on an atomic scale. The first experiment conducted using the theory of conduction of protons, which resulted in the observation of neutrons decaying rapidly into neutrons, was referred to as the first '' bang ''. He published his findings in a 1959 paper in the journal Nature and shared this important discovery with Ferdinand von Neumann.Kosciuszko is considered one of the greatest physicist of the 20th century.He is a member of the German Academy of Science, and the Albertina Wilhelm Leopoldina. He also presented his research in the scientific papers of Karl Popper.Kosciuszko was named a Chevalier of the Order of Merit of the German Empire in 1958.

 Price was born at Merthyr Cynog , near Brecon . After the death of his father , a curate , Price was educated at Christ College , Brecon , before matriculating on 5 November 1779 as a sizar of Jesus College , Cambridge , but was nearly penniless by summer 1780 and had to leave the University . He decided to join the East India Company 's army , becoming a cadet in it due to his father 's friends ' influence , sailing for India on the Essex in 1781 and reaching Madras in August that year before volunteering to serve in southern India and returning to the Essex to take him there . He participated in the siege of Negapatam and the capture of Trincomali in Ceylon during the passage to Bombay , arriving on 22 April 1782 and being appointed the following November to command the 2nd Battalion of Bombay sepoys . He then served in the wars on Tippu Sultan in 1782-84 , 1790–92 and 1799 , losing a leg at the siege of Dharwar in 1791 and thus being re-posted to the guard of Sir Charles Malet , political minister at Poona , then in 1792 to a staff appointment at Surat by the Bombay governor Jonathan Duncan the elder .   
 During his time at Surat he had enough free time to become keenly interested in Persian culture , collecting manuscripts and studying its historical classics , including the Akbarnama by Abu ' l-Fazl , though he also rose to become the Bombay Army 's judge-advocate-general from 1795 to 1805 . A brevet captain by 1795 , he was promoted to full captain two years later . He also served as military secretary and interpreter to Colonel Alexander Dow in Malabar ( 1797–8 ) and then as Persian translator to General James Stuart , commander of the Bombay Army ( 1799 ) , being present at Seringapatam 's capture and acting as the army 's prize agent ( thus making his own fortune ) . Next he returned to Bombay to continue his studies of Persia , being promoted to major in March 1804 before finally returning to Britain in February 1805 , though he only retired from the Company in October 1807 , on his marriage to a relative .   
 He lived in retirement at Brecon , writing works on oriental history and serving as magistrate and deputy lieutenant of Brecknockshire . He was also a committee member of the Oriental Translation Fund , winning its gold medal in 1830 , and of the Royal Asiatic Society ( bequeathing the latter over 70 oriental manuscripts ) .

 On his return to France his intention was to build steam engines but he was prevented from doing so by lack of funds . Instead he opened a Paris workshop in 1844 where , among other things , he worked on a telegraph with written and keyboard signals , improved Gaetan Bonelli 's electric loom and helped William Hughes improve his early typewriter .   
 He also worked on the gyroscope with Léon Foucault , for whom he also made the pendulum for his famous demonstration in 1851 . In 1854 he built a simpler and improved version of Charles Shepherd 's electromechanical clock.He is best known for designing early electric motors for industrial use , for which he was awarded the valuable Volta Prize in 1857 . In his design electromagnets were energized to attract iron rods attached to a rotating flywheel . At the moment that an iron rod reached the electromagnet , the power to the solenoid was interrupted until the next iron rod approached the electromagnet .

Through her mother-in-law , Ida Bienert , she was introduced to the circle of Bauhaus artists.In 1925 , she opened her own dance school , the Palucca School of Dance , with the support of her husband , after which she and Mary Wigman became competitors . In 1928 , she opened a branch of her school in Berlin . In 1931 , another branch was opened in Stuttgart.In 1939 , because of her Jewish ancestry the National Socialistic authorities closed her schools and she was not allowed to teach dance lessons , however she was permitted to continue dancing herself and in 1936 she even appeared in the Olympic Games in Berlin.In 1945 , during the air raid on Dresden , Palucca lost all her possessions . After 1945 , the Russian style of ballet dominated the training in Palucca school.She became founding member of the East German Academy of Arts . In 1959 , East German culture policy officials wanted to see the school transformed into a Soviet-style socialist professional school of dance .

Mahatma Gandhi ( January 22, 1776 – February 25, 1889 ), born in Coombe, County Durham, England, was the first non-British Indian Prime Minister of India.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Gandhi was born at a comparatively small property near Duddington, Hampshire, England, on January 22, 1776.  
 He was the son of William and Mary ( née Godman ) Gandhi, a Reformed Baptist minister.  
 He was the second child of John Stephenson and Elizabeth Harrison. He was the nephew of General James Douglas ( 1694-1782 ) and his wife Mary George ( née Grace ). Gandhi was educated privately by his father and brothers, Andrew, Henry and Charles.He fought with the Ordnance Survey under General Sir George Marshall for the support of the War of 1812. In the years following the repeal of the Corn Laws he served as Major-General of the Imperial Forces and returned to India as a non-commissioned officer. He founded the National Frontier Commission in 1819, and the Mandate for South India ( or Commonwealth of India ) in 1822. In the Valley of the Two Rivers he was awarded the Medal of Honour by King George V. Gandhi, acting in the cause of independence from Britain, was also the founder of the Indian National Congress, a political party ( National Congress ) which became the fourth largest party in India.He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the District of Durham in 1822, serving from 1824 to 1831. He served as Prime Minister of India for 25 years ( from 1845 to 1874 ). As Leader of the British Indian National Congress, he stood down from his seat as Prime Minister of India in protest against the policies of the Indian National Congress. He was succeeded by Lord Palmerston, who received the Croonian Award from the Government of the United Kingdom.  
 Gandhi supported the `` benevolent seigneurialism '' of Lord Mountbatten, which made it easier for poor people to access equal opportunities in politics. He endorsed the idea of building a canal through Burma, and by contrast the legacy of the 1870 British invasion of India, after India was separated from the British Empire, led to the erosion of his legacy. He was also an advocate of provincial autonomy. He was an advocate of equal funding for schools.  
   
   
 == In popular culture ==  
 Gandhi is frequently referenced in the screen series Street Fighter 2. His inability to speak the Indian language has led to his struggles during the game, and he speaks with a Thai accent.A street in London, England, is named Gandhi Street.  
 A major quest in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is called `` Mahatma Gandhi's legacy, '' a questline that can be found in the south eastern wilderness. The player must travel to the district of Mahatma Gandhi, where a symbolic historical marker is located.A radio sitcom is called  
 Gandhi, and is based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.  
 Gandhi and the Dalai Lama are two of the main characters in Bajrang Dal, a movie that was made in 1997. He is played by Sanjay Dutt. The character is also a focus in the novel The Larger Buddha.  
 Gandhi is also a main character in an Indian soap opera, The King of Madras, which is set during the presidency of Jayasimha Rao,  
 the most well known in India.  
 A biopic about Gandhi titled `` A Sufi Among Animals '' was made in 1995. The film was directed by Bipin Rawat. The story is set in India, but focuses on Gandhi's life as an Indian in the post independence era, and focuses on his struggle for national unity and for spiritual regeneration.  
 A cast of civil servants from the Indian government led by Lord Mountbatten, Gandhi's predecessor, led a wave of anti-colonial activism in India from 1960 to 1962. This movement successfully brought about reforms that have made India a leader in many disciplines and inventions.

 = Simon Alan Cossman =  
Simon Alan William Cossman ( April 17, 1895 – March 3, 2001 ) was an American statistician, known for his research on insurance and home insurance.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Cossman was born in Nippon, Japan in 1895. His family had moved to Pittsburgh during the Great Depression. Cossman attended the Pennsylvania Institute of Technology, graduating with a B.S. in mathematics in 1930.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Cossman completed his M.A. and Ph.D. from Columbia University and University of Michigan in 1935 and 1940, respectively. He also worked as a research assistant at the time of his appointment in the office of James M. Underwood, the dean of the business school at Columbia.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
 In 1947, Cossman and Frank Bentley, his assistant, performed a series of experiments on home insurance. One of the major things they attempted was to determine the profitability of fixed-rate insurance policies. The two studied the rate at which policyholders lost money if they bought into a rate 1 % lower than normal. The results were published in 1948 in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.  
   
   
 === Research ===  
 In 1953, Cossman and Bentley published their research on national labor-market statistics. In this year, Cossman became an Associate Research Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He went on to work at RAND Corporation. He became a Professor Emeritus in 1974 at Columbia University. Cossman and Bentley's work brought much attention to the practice of reviewing premiums to find out if the coverage is affordable.  
   
   
 === Death ===  
 Cossman died in 2001 in Brooklyn, New York at age 82. He was survived by his wife, an adult son, a daughter, and six grandchildren.

 == Education ==   
 Niessen began his studies in physics at the University of Utrecht in 1914 . In 1922 , he received his doctorate under L. S. Ornstein . He was an assistant at the University from 1921 to 1928 , except for his postdoctoral study and research at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld , 1925 to 1926 on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship . He also spent 1928 to 1929 on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.In 1922 , Niessen ’ s doctoral thesis , as well as Wolfgang Pauli ’ s extended doctoral thesis , dealt with the hydrogen molecule ion in the Bohr-Sommerfeld framework . Their work is referred to as the Pauli-Niessen model . Their works helped to show the inadequacy of the old quantum mechanics , which gave physicists the impetus to explore new paths which led to the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg and Max Born in 1925 and the wave mechanics formulation by Erwin Schrödinger in 1926 , which were shown to be equivalent .

 = Charles Roseley =  
Charles Roseley ( or Roseley, 1789–1855 ) was a British entomologist and manufacturer, who was the first person to make entomological specimens in Philadelphia.  
 Charles Roseley was born at Morristown, near Leeds, Yorkshire, England, August 13, 1789, the fourth of the six children of Mary Roseley, a mercer, and William Roseley, an architect. He attended Edinburgh Grammar School, studied arts there and then entered St John's College, Cambridge to study Philosophy and Mathematics. While a student, he attended the annual lectures of Richard Owen ; the winning essay, `` On the Variation of the Dimensions of Space by the Different Directions of the Earth and other Objects '' was his intellectual forerunner. In 1821, he attended the lectures of W. E. Banting at the Royal Academy, London. After graduating in 1822, he was appointed to St John's College, Cambridge, where he remained three years.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 On leaving Cambridge, Roseley took a number of lectures, including in London. These were all taken by Professor William Campbell in the history of astronomy. The connections which arose between the two men led to discussions which culminated in Roseley's making an entomological specimen of one of Campbell's trophies. He went on to publish several scientific papers, including a monograph on Coleoptera, in which he investigated Coleoptera species such as the Southern sparrow or the Old-English warbler. In 1836, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1843 he was awarded a `` Medal '' by the Royal Society of London.Roseley continued working until 1850 when he went to Cape Town to become the manager of the Cape Mining Company. Here he obtained hold of the patents for the Croonian line of mines and was in 1844 the owner of the Croonian copper mine. Thereafter he became a large manager of miners and wholesale draperies in Cape Town. His ability to create an adequate and successful mining enterprise was recognized by an invitation from James Egan and Ernest Owen to attend their travels through South Africa, Ireland and the Cape Verde Islands.On his return to England, Roseley became an unpaid member of the New York Association of Naturalists ( 1800–1802 ), and served as their secretary until it dissolved. Roseley was also a naturalist curator in the Museums of London ( 1805–1806 ).  
 In 1846, he received from George Beeck an invitation to take charge of his family business, Charles Roseley and Sons, a firm which manufactured musical instruments, instruments for drafting, clothes and other household items.Charles Roseley died at his home at Weston-super-Mare in Wiltshire on August 20, 1855.

 = Virginia Barnes =  
Virginia, née Goodrick ( 15 June 1885 – 23 June 1939 ) was an American Protestant clergyman and a prolific writer on theology and other subjects. The congregation for women at Missionary Baptist Church in Santa Barbara, California, began to call her `` Edith's Parson '' when she retired in the late 1920s, although she and her husband were never married.

 == Career as theologian ==  
 While teaching for one year at Butler College, Barnes gained membership in the Radical Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, an offshoot of the Utah Church. During the Second Great Awakening in the mid-1880s, she became a close friend and collaborator of Helen Walker Linnell, who wrote the book The Female Church, which was published the following year, and who devoted much of her time and effort to preaching and writing to reform the women of the church, most of whom had been disenfranchised by the church's ban on black females.  
 At the time of her death, Barnes was preaching the first sermon on women in Germany, `` Prinzip und Kraften. Deutsche Halbertheiden. '', and there she met and married her husband, Claudio Barnes, a world-renowned African American Theologian, theologian and activist, and a leader in the first international women's Christian organization of women, the Second Church of Christ in Christ in America ( SCLC ).

 The pure plantation economy ( 1600 – 1838 )   
 The plantation economy modified ( 1839 – 1938 )   
 The plantation economy further modified ( 1939 - ... . ) The economy during the first phase was characterised by a slavery as the main mode of production and the plantation system as the main unit of production . The second phase saw the abolition of the slave system and the introduction of wage labour in an indentured form . The third phase was differentiated by the emergence a limited and restricted level of economic diversity as activities such as peasant agriculture , mining , and wholesale and retail trade started to compete with plantation agriculture .

Otto Reckler ( January 12, 1911 – August 6, 2003 ) was a German philosopher, composer, and music critic.  
 Born in Braunau, Reckler attended the Sorbonne, after which he became a music critic for the Sternische Zeitung. He was a philosopher of music, whose interests in aesthetics and counterpoint came to expression in the use of logic and formal language. He collaborated with Carl Reinecke, the most influential of modern German composers. Reckler was also known for the impact of music criticism in the second half of the 20th century, during which his work developed beyond his initial goal of writing music criticism.  
 He was elected a member of the Royal German Academy of Arts and Sciences ( NDB ) in 1931, an honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1934, and awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1936. The NDB awarded him an honorary doctorate ( G.D. ) in 1954, the second of its kind in the European region, and two months later, in 1956, the Guggenheim was given the Heinrich Ludolf Lecture prize in his birthplace.His most important works include works for orchestra and piano, among them Die Freunden in einem piano ( 1945 ), and Traumstreifung der musikalischen Beobachtungen zu den Musikbalischen Straßen und würde ( A Way of Making the Musical World More Musical ) ( 1946 ). He wrote plays as well as scores for radio, TV and radio and television documentaries. Many of his best-known works are written in Italian.

 = Franz Kramers =  
Franz Kramers ( 16 April 1689 – 5 February 1712 ) was a German priest, anatomist and entomologist.  
 Kramers is best known for his father ’ s collection of moths and butterflies, now called Kramers, the better known Kramers collection ( Kramers'collection of butterflies ). A number of other insects are also from this collection.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Franz Kramers was born to a Lutheran family in Kiel in the Palatinate. After the death of his father in 1683, he studied in St. Petersburg. He received his habilitation on 30 August 1685.  
 In 1690, Kramers obtained his doctorate at the University of Giessen under Richard Hauptmann. In 1696, he became a professor of anatomy and parasitology at the University of Greifswald.  
 He died in the care of the King in 1712.  
 Kramers has produced in several works a considerable number of figures of moths and butterflies. The first of these was the entire Kramers collection, which was acquired by Jules Verne in the Verdon-sur-Mer. He also published a series of articles on moths in his Jahre moeir.  
 In the reprints of Verne, he has placed the Breviary of his father, Bishop Johann Philipp Schüler, in 1680-1711. On this Kramers ’ original catalogue of eider moth remains very uncertain, as apparently all the parts can not be represented at full length with precision. The genera Sklogger ( family Leucospiza ) and Lepioptria ( family Sphingidae ) are named in his honour.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Kramers ’ mother was ( probably ) Agnes Maria von Warzek. He was described by Heinrich Johann Klaproth as “ an educated bachelor in the country, but otherwise unwise ”. Kramers was married twice, first in 1684 to Marie-Josepha von Stenlund, the daughter of Schüler's court physician Johannes Martin Stenlund, and second to Magdalena Anna Rossin in 1689.

 = Willoughby Verner =   
Colonel William Willoughby Cole Verner ( 22 October 1852 – 25 January 1922 ) was a British soldier , writer and ornithologist and inventor of a type of compass . He was briefly a Professor of Topography at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst . He is remembered for bringing Cueva de la Pileta , a cave filled with prehistoric paintings , to international attention .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Verner was born in 1852 and he showed an early interest in bones owning the fossils of extinct animals . By 1867 he had started his own diary recording his interest in egg collecting and shooting . In 1874 he joined the Rifle Brigade and was posted to Gibraltar although he also holidayed on the Scottish island of Tiree with fellow naturalist Howard Irby where they continued their interest in studying , shooting ( and eating ) the local wildlife . He continued his diary until 1890 .   
    
 He took out patents to improve a cavalry sketch board which was designed to be used strapped to the wrist . In 1895 Verner had a novel version of a compass named after him . The compass was manufactured by two different companies and version nine of the design was still being made in 1942 .   
    
 Verner became the official historian of the Rifle Brigade and he edited the letters home of one of its majors to produce A British Rifle Man : The Journals and Correspondence of Major George Simmons , Rifle Brigade , during the Peninsular War & Campaign of Waterloo .   
 He also wrote The Military Life of H. R. H. George : Duke of Cambridge based on Prince George , Duke of Cambridge .   
 He wrote Sketches in the Soudan ( sic ) in 1885 and Rapid Field-Sketching and Reconnaissance and Advanced Guard and Outpost Duties for Riflemen in 1889 . The First British Rifle Corps . He wrote An historical account of the Rifle Brigade and of the King 's Royal Rifle Corps in 1890 and Some Notes on Military Topography in 1891 and Map Reading and the Elements of Field Sketching in 1893 . In 1894 his friend ( Leonard ) Howard Irby published The Ornithology of the Strait of Gibraltar and after he retired to Algeciras he wrote My Life among the Wild Birds in Spain . With illustrations in 1909.In 1911 , Verner discovered Cueva de la Pileta in Benaoján and with Abbe Breuil also discovered Devil 's Tower Cave in Gibraltar . Breil had come to Spain because of Verner 's reporting of Cueva de la Pileta near Ronda . Verner had been told of the cave that had been discovered by a Spanish farmer called José Bullón in 1905 who was looking for bat guano . Bullón had found human remains and markings on the walls , but assumed that they were made by the Moors . Verner had himself lowered into the cave and later reported his findings in the London-based Saturday Review . Verner wrote a number of weekly reports for the Review which factually described the cave , although Verner accounted for the drawings of extinct animals by assuming that they had been sketched a result of observing the fossil bones that were there . It was these reports that brought Breuil to Spain with Hugo Obermaier , Paul Wernert and the Spaniard Juan Cabre Aquilo . Breuil stayed in Spain for two months studying the cave paintings whilst funded by the Prince of Monaco . Verner later co-authored a scientific paper with Breuil and Obermaier on Cueva de la Pileta .   
 Verner wrote History and Campaigns of the Rifle Brigade in 1912 . In 1917 Breuil returned and he and Verner were warned off their next investigation of Devil 's Tower Cave in Gibraltar by a local policeman ( but not before they had retrieved some Neanderthal tools ) . Their final visit to the cave was in 1919 and they were convinced that this was another home to early man like the earlier finds at Cuerva de la Pieta and at Forbes ' Quarry Cave , Gibraltar 1 had been found over fifty years earlier . Their confidence was confirmed when Gibraltar 2 was found nearby in the early 1920s by Dorothy Garrod who had come to investigate at Breuil 's encouragement .

 Bassan was born at Daventry. He was the son of Rev. John Bassan and Charlotte Battan. He was educated at St Francis's School, Strand. In 1874, he entered the Natural History Department of the City College of New York, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1878.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Bassan studied medicine at the Zoological Institute of London. In 1886 he went to Germany, settling in Munich. In 1887, he married Elizabeth Edward Hope of Runcorn ; and they had four children : Amelia Bassan ( 1891–1914 ), David Battan ( 1892–1965 ), Lorraine Bassan ( 1896–1936 ), and Walter Bassan ( 1901–1963 ). During his short visit, Bassan discovered several rare plants that are still in common use, for example, the rubble crab Melaleuca paradisi.  
 On the outbreak of war between Germany and France in 1894, he and two members of his family moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, where he was rector of the local Normal School for the Blind. In 1900, he and his wife had one child, Marion. Bassan died on 29 March 1897 in Manhattan.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 One of the most important research botanists in the world at the turn of the century, Bassan produced a long list of over 40 taxa of fungi. He also introduced the first genera of the red lanternspotted plants, Fatula ( 1905 ), Jullia ( 1911 ), Luminae ( 1920 ), and Tonaria ( 1922 ). He authored ( with Arthur N. Greenberg ) the `` Flora New York '' series ( 1923 ). Bassan received the National Medal of Science in 1922, and his name appears on two United States postage stamps. In 1928, he was the subject of a new biography, `` The Father of Botany in Jamaica '', by Jessie Shively. Dr. Joseph Bassan was the first living descendant of the Josiah Bassan family, who were the first non-English speakers in Jamaica.In 1937, Dr. Joseph Bassan was invited to enter the prestigious Botany Hall of Fame of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, a post he held for several years.

 = Philibert Orry =   
Philibert Orry , count of Vignory and lord of La Chapelle-Godefroy ( born in Troyes on 22 January 1689 – died at La Chapelle-Godefroy on 9 November 1747 ) , was a French statesman .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 The fifth child of Jean Orry , a leading economist , Philibert Orry served as a cavalry captain during the War of Spanish Succession , before becoming a member of the Parlement of Paris , then master of requests in 1715 . He was an intendant in Lille ( 1715-1718 ) , Soissons ( 1722-1727 ) , and Roussillon ( 1727-1728 ) .   
 Orry was named Controller-General of Finances in 1730 and combined this function with being director general of the Bâtiments du Roi ( `` the king 's buildings '' ) in 1736 , after the death of the duc d'Antin . Orry remained Controller-General until 1745 , making him the longest continuously-serving holder of the office in the eighteenth-century .   
 An able economist , Orry had to restore the dixième ( `` tenth '' ) tax and declared the venality of municipal officials , successfully balancing the budget in 1739-40 . Applying the principles of Colbert , he sought to develop the domestic manufacture of textiles and paper , and was involved in the production of porcelain in Vincennes in 1740 . He supported trade with Canada and the Indies by reforming the statutes of the Compagnie des Indes .   
 As director general of buildings , he established the bi-annual public Paris Salon , and became the vice-protecteur of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture ( `` Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture '' ) in April 1737 . His directorship has , generally , been harshly judged . The marquis d'Argenson spoke with contempt of `` the bad , bourgeois taste of Monsieur Orry '' . However , Orry 's selection of Charles-Joseph Natoire in 1730 to decorate his château de La Chapelle-Godefroy ( see below ) reveals , on the contrary , a certain discernement in artistic matters : Natoire was one of the most promising young history painters , and his two main rivals - François Boucher and Carle Van Loo - were both abroad .   
 As director general of Ponts et Chaussées ( bridges and highways ) , Orry finished the Crozat canal and maintained and developed France 's road system . He sent to the intendants , in 1738 , a detailed instruction on the duty ( la corvée royale ) for all inhabitants to spend a fortnight a year on the construction and maintenance of transport routes , classed in five categories . The corvée made France 's major road network the finest in Europe , and before the Revolution , a great part of the public roads existed thanks to this institution . This policy of improved communications also led to the completion of the Cassini map in 1744.Facing opposition from Madame de Pompadour , Orry resigned in 1745 .   
 He was the Treasurer of the Order of the Holy Spirit from February 1743 to his death in 1747 .   
    
    
 == Residences ==   
 Orry owned the château de La Chapelle-Godefroy in Saint-Aubin near Nogent-sur-Seine , inherited from his father in 1719 . `` M. Orry '' , wrote the duc de Luynes in his Mémoires , `` has always appeared to have no ambition , always regretting not being able to live on his estate , near Nogent , and always ready to go there with pleasure . '' He transformed and expanded considerably the seigneurial estate . He owned two paintings by Jean-Antoine Watteau , the Enchanteur and the 'Aventurière , which today are in the musée des Beaux-Arts in Troyes .   
 Orry also possessed an estate , Petit Bercy , in Paris .

 = Roger Fenton (priest) =   
Roger Fenton ( 1565–1615 ) was an English clergyman , one of the translators of the Authorised King James Version .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born in Lancashire and was educated at Pembroke Hall , Cambridge , where he matriculated as a sizar in 1585 . He graduated B.A . in 1589 , becoming a fellow in 1590 . He graduated M.A . in 1592 ; he later proceeded B.D . in 1602 and D.D . in 1613 . From 1598 he was preacher to the readers at Gray 's Inn , and held the post till his death.In 1601 he was made rector of St. Stephen 's , Walbrook , and in 1603 of the neighbouring St. Benet 's Sherehog . He resigned the latter in 1606 , on his appointment to the vicarage of Chigwell , Essex . In 1609 he succeeded Lancelot Andrewes in the prebend of St. Pancras in St. Paul 's , which made him rector and patron , as well as vicar , of Chigwell . Fenton was one of the Second Westminster Company of translators of the King James Bible , dealing with the Epistles of the New Testament . He died 16 January 1615 , and was buried under the communion-table .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Fenton 's first work , An Answer to William Alablaster his Motives , was published in 1599 , noting that William Alabaster was then a prisoner in the Tower of London .   
 In 1611 Fenton published A Treatise of Usurie , in three books ; there was a second edition in 1612 . In 1652 there appeared a tract by Robert Filmer The author states in his preface that George Downame , Fenton and Andrewes are the noted opponents of usury , in England , but ( he continues ) ' I have made choice of Dr. Fenton 's treatise to examine because it is latest , and I find little of any moment but is in him . ' A note by Roger Twysden in Filmer 's book suggests it was written three decades before publication .   
 A manuscript in the Cambridge University Library ( MS Ff . 5 . 25 , fos . 17r–22r ) contains a contemporary copy of a brief treatise by Fenton , entitled 'De Æquivocatione ' ( On Equivocation ) . It is dedicated to Sir Francis Bacon in his capacity as Solicitor-General , and must therefore date from between 1607 and 1613 . Like the English treatise Of Usurie this Latin document consists of the resolution of three disputed questions on the subject of the work .   
 Fenton was a popular preacher of the day ; one of his sermons , 'Of Simonie and Sacriledge , ' was published in 1604 , from which it appears that he was at that date chaplain to Sir Thomas Egerton , the lord chancellor . Another was published in 1615 , 'Upon Oathes , ' preached before the Grocers ' Company ; and a small volume containing four more appeared in 1616 .   
 In 1617 , Fenton 's successor at Chigwell , Emmanuel Utie , published a posthumous work by Fenton entitled A Treatise against the Necessary Dependence upon that One Head and the present Reconciliation to the Church of Rome . Together with certaine sermons preached in publike assemblies . Utie prefixes a dedication of his own to Sir Francis Bacon , in which he calls the treatise 'the Posthumus [ image ] of Doctor Fenton ' , but says that it lacked final revision . In his dedication he alludes to Fenton 's earlier dedication of his treatise on usury to Bacon 's predecessor as Lord Keeper , Sir Thomas Egerton . The sermons in this volume are six in number , with three of them having been preached before King James .

 = Alexander Griffiths (musician) =  
Alexander Griffiths ( November 8, 1911 – February 14, 1987 ) was an American pianist, music educator and administrator. Griffiths was a distinguished teacher at the Mondavi School of Music in Jerusalem and toured in Europe and North America, and helped establish many American recording and radio stations.Griffiths earned a degree from the Rochester Institute of Technology, earning his Haverford College Music Licensure in 1932. Griffiths taught at Mondavi School for almost thirty years, retiring in 1984. He also taught at ROTC's Northwestern University, from 1945 to 1949 and from 1949 to 1957. During this time he made an incursion into the international career scene in Los Angeles, where he founded and directed the Los Angeles Music School.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Griffiths was born in a music family and went to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1921. Griffiths studied piano and composition with Eno Van Itterschoot in Budapest and at the Amsterdam Conservatory, where he was named head of a large piano orchestra. He also taught at Mount Holyoke College and at the Juilliard School.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1935, Griffiths founded the Mondavi School of Music in Jerusalem, where he taught privately for more than ten years. The school merged into Mondavi College in 1949, and he went on to be a member of the board of directors. Griffiths was a leader in teaching American piano at the Mondavi School, having taught every key major and minor key, both physical and technical. His most notable student was Glenn Miller, who became a central figure in the history of American recording music, and is credited with sparking the birth of modern American recording, the movement that ultimately led to the rapid popularity of classical and jazz music.  
 In 1940, the Mondavi School moved to Israel, and Griffiths took up an teaching position at the Lehigh School of Music. In 1957 he became the director of the Mondavi College Center for Teaching and Research, an institution that had been established in 1961 by Robert Kennedy and Stanley Herzog. A major of the combined Mondavi Center, a performance space in Jerusalem's Old City, Griffiths was able to relocate and move his studio there in 1967, when his graduate students, starting with Eli Garrod and Irving Tenenbaum, began to work in a new school.  
 Griffiths founded the jazz label The J.C. Haas Music Company and took a leading role in the RCA Victor label. He had also founded and run the first jazz music school in the country in Israel. Griffiths developed a school system of less government involvement and more individual initiative, which ultimately became a significant part of the experience for young musicians.  
 Griffiths earned two Grammy awards for the piano duet `` Black Bear '' in 1959 and 1969. He continued to work in Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, and returned to the U.S. in 1971. Griffiths also served as chairman of the Berlin Philharmonic from 1968 to 1970 and as executive vice president in the 1980s and '90s of the New York Philharmonic. Griffiths was elected to the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1975.  
 He died in Jerusalem of cancer in 1987.

Francesco Bienielli ( 2 April 1813 – 17 July 1888 ) was an Italian mathematician and one of the most celebrated mathematicians of the 20th century.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Francesco Bienielli was born in Genoa, Italy and studied mathematics at the Lycée in Parma. He later enrolled in the University of Padua, and there learned physics and Latin. He attended the United States Naval Academy ( 1862–1867 ) where he studied mathematics under the guidance of Louis Davison, finishing the school year with a Ph.D. under Bostrom.In 1868, at the age of twenty-nine, Bienielli wrote his first work, First Data of the Cosmological Principle in conjunction with Salvatore Filippelli ( his doctoral student ). In the same year he published his second book, Cosmological Particles, in the Astrological Journal and also made an astronomical discovery. This resulted in his being offered the university position of Professor of Mathematical physics at Pisa in 1869. At that time there were no facilities in Pisa for experimental physicists.Bienielli obtained his appointment in 1871, and he in 1874 published his first article on the motion of spherical torus around the sun, taking its plane. After years of extensive scientific work, including the motion of the Earth around the sun, he submitted his book to L'Académie des sciences mathématiques in 1879. He made the first attempt at describing all possible Maxwellian plates. In 1881, Bienielli's The Concept of Volume was published. Bienielli demonstrated that the elliptic class of particles consists of Maxwellian plate layers, one for each charge-energy function, which was later recognized by contemporary biophysicists, as an area of interest in relativity. Bienielli was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Naples in 1884. In the same year he married Maria Rosa di Milano ( 1851–1874 ) and they had a son and a daughter. In the same year, he also published his most important paper, `` On the Sun ''. By 1886, he had begun to publish various books and papers, mostly on the history of mathematics. Among his more famous publications were the Elements of Newtonian Mechanics ( 1883 ) and Mechanics of the Earth ( 1893 ). Bienielli died in Naples in 1888 and was buried in Naples Cemetery.

 John A. Fries =  
John A. Fries ( March 28, 1927 – July 20, 1998 ) was an American industrial chemist and bacteriologist. He was instrumental in the research of an easily isolated zinc deficiency in cereal plants.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 John Albert Fries was born on March 28, 1927 in Wisconsin. His father died when he was two years old. He attended a Lutheran school in Plainfield, Minnesota. When Fries was in middle school he developed an allergy to peanuts. By the time he reached high school he was allergic to many of the same foods. He left school at 18 and entered the University of Wisconsin as a Biochemistry major, where he studied Chemical Engineering.He received his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1954 under the supervision of Robert L. Burt.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Disorders ===  
 In 1962, John Albert Fries was appointed the founding Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Disorders at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). This position had previously been held by Henry J. Hugan.Fries was assigned by NIH as a Research Scientist to gather evidence of a deficiency of zinc in cereals. During this research, Fries discovered a zinc deficiency in wheat. There was no known mechanism to explain why the deficiency occurred in specific cereal crops. Using analysis of the intestinal microbes of wheat and potato, Fries was able to determine that zinc deficiency was due to dietary zinc deficiency. Fries was able to isolate the single yellow phenylalanine he found in yellow bread in yellow mold ; this was the first zinc-containing food. His wheat-yellow mold study proved to be an important contribution to the understanding of the function of zinc in proteins and vitamin B12.  
   
   
 === Health physicist ===  
 In the early 1970s, Fries became director of the National Institute of Allergy, Infectious Diseases, and Immunology ( NIID ), where he headed the Center for Excellence in Life Sciences at the NIH. From 1980 to 1989, he served on the editorial board of the leading life science journal, Science.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 The principal object of his work was the pathophysiology of pathologic conditions related to normal physiological processes, and the determination of viable candidate proteins in disorders. In 1960, Fries married Mary Elizabeth Kate Olsen, an expert nutritionist and author, with whom he had two daughters. He died on July 20, 1998 in Tuskegee, Alabama at the age of 71. Fries was also a physicist. He invented a procedure called the hotplate centrifuge that allowed the production of large amounts of DNA from non-living living organisms. He had served on an advisory committee to the American Chemical Society from 1967 to 1974.

Frances Mackenzie, sometimes called Frances McGinty, was an Irish woman born in Cork, Ireland, the daughter of Almon Mackenzie and Mary Frances ( Morley ) McGinty. Her father was a tradesman. She also had an older brother and sister.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 McGinty was born on 14 March 1884 in Cork, Ireland, the daughter of Almon Mackenzie and Mary Frances ( Morley ) McGinty. Her father was a mancher at the Dublin Fish and Game Company, and on his death remarried Frances'mother. McGinty was the youngest of six daughters and granddaughters of the Mackenzie family. They all were educated at the Royal Dublin Academy and St. Columba's High School, Cork, graduating in 1897.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 McGinty was working in the grain-dealers office in Cork from 1907 to 1914. She was particularly interested in carpentry and embroidery. After taking leave of absence in 1914, she completed a degree in applied mechanics at the Royal Dublin Academy in 1916. She then returned to the Fisheries Department, serving as a market agent. She returned to the Academy as a sub-agent for its branch office in Dublin, and went on to graduate from University College Cork in 1922.  
 After working for the Fisheries Department, she returned to Dublin as a market agent, eventually becoming an assistant to Dr. James Connolly, a chemist in the Department of Fisheries.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 In December 1936 she married John MacDougall, a businessman who had worked for her father-in-law. Her health deteriorated as she worked at the market in Cork, and she was required to sleep on the street on a daily basis. She eventually came to the conclusion that she would rather work on top of the boy, on the open blue herring farm near the Royal Dublin Academy. However, this view was countered by her husband, who wanted to farm a little distance from the Academy, for his business in Cork. She gave him a steady stream of fish, returning to the Academy in time to see it opened up in December 1939.Frances'husband died in 1942, when she was 19 years old, and she moved in with her mother in Cork. They had two daughters and a son.  
 In 1950, she married senior clergyman Richard L'Estrange, and they had a son, John, who became a United Nations representative, an architect and, subsequently, a Unesco official.

 The two Madges were active in the Cambridge University Socialist Society . Cyril Bibby comments with reference to them as well as Maurice Dobb , the twins Francis and Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce , Margot Heinemann and `` the beautiful Eileen Wynne '' that `` it was noticeable how many of these extreme left-wingers came from privileged upper-class homes '' ( Reminiscences of a Happy Life , p. 171 )

 = Vito Sallie =  
Vito Sallie ( 15 January 1844 – 21 March 1941 ) was an Italian zoologist.  
 In 1892, Sallie moved to the United States in order to do fieldwork. The general public was at a loss how to explain the appearance of Sallie's cattle, despite his previous documentation of them. In 1901, Sallie described the white-throated trilobite for the first time, however because of technical difficulties he was unable to publish the research in its entirety. In 1920, Sallie and two other `` reliable '' zoologists, Edward Plass, played the part of ophthalmologists in reviewing and feeding the species of mako ( Araneus maculatus ), which had previously been seen in photographs taken in a Japanese expedition. The discovery of mako consumption by humans would eventually be documented by this `` reliable '' group of scientists, where Sallie became the `` primary contributor '' to understanding the South Pacific's biological and economical problems.Sallie was President of the American Museum of Natural History from 1893 to 1897. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as of the Southwestern Biology Association, and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was awarded the First Class Scientific Merit of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1903.Sallie also participated in negotiations with the United States Navy in 1916 and 1918 to introduce naval ships into a New Zealand Antarctic expedition for a scientific trial, which was to provide a platform for Franklin Delano Roosevelt to make a public statement, which could have predicted the worst in subsequent years as well.Because of his research, Sallie was nominated for membership on the Academy's Hall of Fame in 1921, as well as a Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Denis Nikolayevich Maleev ( Russian : Пригельевич Миха́льев ; 11 June 1922 – 23 April 1983 ) was a Soviet industrial designer. He was the founder of his country's first in-house e-commerce platform. He was also involved in developing many technologies related to e-commerce such as e-commerce design.The Geely e-commerce platform was founded in 1985 and, over time, its capabilities have been expanded to include more products. The operating group began the social network site `` Lifestyle '' in 1993, which since 2008 has gone by the name of `` Lifestyleev ''. The Lifestyle group is `` open '', therefore users can create and interact with their profiles, contacts and important political and business figures, as well as others, through social networks.  
 He was a professor at the Aeronautics and Astronautics Institute ( Aviation Engineering Institute ) of the National Academy of Engineering and a member of numerous scientific and industry bodies, among them, the Institute of Aviation Engineering of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  
   
   
 == Education ==  
 Born in the Novodevichy Province, he attended high school in the city of St. Petersburg and graduated in 1927. At that time, he worked for an amateur trade group in his native city of Novodevichy, a subsidiary of Aeroflot. In 1932, at the age of 20, he began his career as a designer.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 With a mechanical and material science background, Maleev taught himself everything he could about designs. His first invention was a lifting seat that he titled `` Lifting seat ''. In 1948 he invented the ‘ gas-powered lifting seat, ’ and the post-war Russian newspaper Diptek, ’ published an account of it.  
 After the USSR became communist, Maleev became the head of the design group at Yuzhno-Novodevichy Ltd. ( today Y. Uzel ). Maleev and his friends tested the design on the railway line, the Dnipropetrovsk-3 ( Dnipro ) line, between St. Petersburg and Sochi. It introduced advanced steps such as automatic seat selection and reclining.  
 Maleev's experimental design, introduced in 1951, proved that if the seats are lifted on their respective segments and not one piece, it becomes possible to allow occupants to move from one seat to the next with ease. He also invented the ‘ Flight-Brake ’ for automatic forward and backward horizontal adjustments. Maleev and his associates made significant improvements to the lift system, and between 1952 and 1959 nearly $ 12 billion in sales were realized on Lifts-Centrice. Maleev was twice elected a Soviet state scientist.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Femaleev was not only the creator of an innovative and competitive e-commerce industry, but also a pioneering social scientist. He was deeply involved in development of communications technology for the e-commerce industry. He is also known for work related to the problem of traffic congestion in urban areas, in addition to invention and invention related to issues of rural economic development, and the creation of information technology and the Internet. His inventions also brought him respect from the Russian public.In 1990 Maleev received the Lenin Prize. It is awarded `` for individual merits with a philosophical character and long-lasting and enduring value to the world, '' as stated by the design group at the World Cultural and Scientific Center, Moscow.

 = Gopala Bhatta Goswami =   
Gopala Bhatta Goswami ( 1503–1578 ) is one of the foremost disciples of the Vaishnava saint , Chaitanya Mahaprabhu , and a leading historical figure in the Gaudiya Vaishnava school of Hinduism . He was part of a group of Vaishnava devotees known collectively as the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan , who were influential in establishing the philosophical basis of the Gaudiya tradition in formalised writings .   
    
    
 == Background ==   
 Born in a Sri vaishnava family of Tamil Iyengar origin in sri rangam , and the son of Venkatta Bhatta , Gopala bhatta goswami was a great devotee of Laxmi-Narayana . According to biographies such as the Bhakti Ratnakara Gopal Bhatta 's first meeting with Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was in 1510 during Mahaprabhu 's tour of South India . Although of a young age he was given the opportunity to meet with Chaitanya and serve him over a number of months . Such was his love for the saint , that when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was about to leave , Gopala Bhatta became upset , and for Gopala Bhatta 's sake , Chaitanya then agreed to stay a few more days .   
 According to Gaudiya tradition it was during this time that Gopala Bhatta had a spiritual vision in which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu revealed Himself as an avatar of Krishna , the supreme God . In the vision Krishna then told him that in the town of Vrindavan he would meet with two devotees , namely Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami who would instruct him in the finer details of devotional service ( bhakti ) .   
 When Gopala Bhatta awoke from the experience , he wanted to leave for Vrindavan at once , however Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told him to stay and serve his parents . After Chaitanya 's departure , Gopal Bhatta took guidance from his uncle Prabhodananda Sarasvati . Gopal Bhatta took care of his parents into their old age , and then after they died he then traveled to Vrindavana . There he met Rupa and Sanatana who accepted him as a brother . Gopal Bhatta later helped Sanatana compile the book Hari Bhakti Vilasa .   
    
    
 == Vrindavan ==   
    
 Gopala Bhatta studied rhetoric , poetry , Vedanta , and Sanskrit grammar from his uncle Prabodhananda Sarasvati . After the passing of his parents he went to Vrindavan , where he met both Rupa and Sanatana Goswamis as had purportedly been instructed in his vision .   
 When Lord Chaitanya discovered that Gopala Bhatta was in Vrindavan , he was extremely pleased and sent some of his personal belongings to Gopala Bhatta , who worshiped them . Mahaprabhu also sent a letter instructing Gopala Bhatta to help Rupa and Sanatana compile Vaishnava literature . Gopala Bhatta accepted this instruction as his life and soul , and he later also engaged his disciple Srinivasa Acarya in carrying the writings to Bengal . Gopala Bhatta established the Radha Raman Temple in Vrindavan in 1542 , his samadhi also exists within the temple complex .

 Taurinus described his logarithmic-spherical geometry as the `` third system '' besides Euclidean geometry and spherical geometry , and pointed out that infinitely many systems exist depending on an arbitrary constant . While he noticed that no contradictions can be found in his logarithmic-spherical geometry , he remained convinced of the special role of Euclidean geometry . According to Paul Stäckel and Friedrich Engel , as well as Zacharias , Taurinus must be given credit as a founder of non-Euclidean trigonometry ( together with Gauss ) , but his contributions can not be considered as being on the same level as those of the main founders of non-Euclidean geometry , Nikolai Lobachevsky and János Bolyai .   
 Taurinus corresponded with Gauss about his ideas in 1824 . In his reply , Gauss mentioned some of his own ideas on the subject , and encouraged Taurinus to further investigate this topic , but he also told Taurinus not to publicly cite Gauss . When Taurinus sent his works to Gauss , the latter did n't respond – according to Stäckel that was probably due to the fact that Taurinus mentioned Gauss in the prefaces of his books . In addition , Taurinus sent some copies of his `` Geometriae prima elementa '' to friends and authorities ( Stäckel reported a positive reply by Georg Ohm ) . Dissatisfied with the lack of recognition , Taurinus burnt the remaining copies of that book – the only copy found by Stäckel and Engel was in the library of the University of Bonn . In 2015 , another copy of the `` Geometriae prima elementa '' was digitized and made freely available online by the University of Regensburg .

 Shaw was born in Syracuse, New York, to J. Frank Shaw, a businessman, and his wife, actress Gertrude Porter. She was a geologist and the oldest of three daughters of Herbert W. Shaw and Annie Mildred Fitzsimmons. She was active in journalism and school. In 1963 she married I. Sidney Shepherd. In 1963, she graduated from Lawrence State College ( known as SUNY ) with a degree in botany. In 1970, Shaw became the first female student in SUNY's botany department, and in 1976, the first woman in the history of the department to hold a full-time position.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 Shaw received her bachelor's degree from Lawrence State College in 1953. In 1957, she began writing professional geology articles for Scientific American. She moved on to pursue her Ph.D. at New York University ( NYU ) with a thesis on the earth's crust and a later thesis on carboniferous paleozoic Tectonics.  
 After receiving her Ph.D. in 1962, Shaw became a Research Assistant at the Geology and Mineral Resources Institute in New York City. She was a faculty member in their Natural Sciences and Engineering departments. She was married to Sheldon I. Shaw, who was a geologist and first vice president of the Geology and Mineral Resources Institute. Sheldon Shaw was a supporter of the Global Cretaceous Project, which was funded by the US Geological Survey. Shaw received the National Medal of Science in 1977 for her `` creative and valuable contributions to geology and mineral resources research and publication ''.  
 In 1974, Shaw joined with colleagues Richard Norris ( formerly of AT & T ), John Hinckley ( formerly of Bell Telephone Laboratories ) and Stu Whiting ( formerly of Mellon University ) at the Western States Geological Survey. While at the Western States, Shaw chaired the Structural Environmental Studies Group ( SEGS ). During her tenure at Western, she published, among other publications, Models of the Earth's Core and The Aeneid.  
 In 1981, Shaw joined with Suzanne Culbertson Rometty to found and edit an annual magazine in her husband's name : GBS, for Global Carbon and Earth's Carbon ; Folsom, California, also known as the Grand Canyon. It is a group of young geologists who have traveled through the Grand Canyon on a regular basis from 2000 to 2015 and carry a work plan, a map, and an interest in the environment. Their publication is documented in the book, `` Paleoclimatology, Epochs, and Past Geological Sights of the Grand Canyon, '' where they illustrate it through real-world examples including the area's parks, hiking trails, and even fossil formations.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Shaw was married to Geologist Sheldon Shaw and they had three daughters.  
 In 1969, Shaw married Arnold N. Shaw ( 1985 ), a geologist and research engineer, and they had a daughter, Amy. Shaw died at her home on October 13, 1990, in Folsom, California.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 Shaw's colleagues have called her `` the Earth ’ s most dedicated geologist, '' and she wrote her entire career on behalf of mankind. She is credited with coining the term `` influence of the Earth ’ s spin ''.

 = William F. Agnew =  
William F. Agnew ( June 20, 1876 – April 1, 1935 ) was an American pharmacologist and bacteriologist, whose early career as an administrator at Imperial Chemical Industries and major roles in the development of penicillin may have set the stage for the development of antibiotic drugs.  
   
   
 == Early life and education ==  
 Agnew was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of James and Catharine Agnew. He attended the Victor Lincoln High School of Woodbridge, Vermont. He received his B.S. degree in medicine from Harvard in 1895 and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1902.  
   
   
 == Scientific career ==  
 He became a major member of the government's Chemical Laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, and a leading purveyor of penicillin, as early as 1897. In 1900 he received a federal appointment as Assistant Under Secretary of the Interior in charge of the Bureau of Standards, which gave him direct control over all federal research. This was particularly important in coordination with the government's Chemical Research Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory, where Agnew was the first to synthesize penicillin. In 1903 he was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He became a professor of medicine at Harvard University in 1905, and went on to lead a large pharmaceutical firm until his death.  
   
   
 == Activism for antibiotic therapy ==  
 In 1894, Agnew and his colleague Joseph A. Rosamilia realized that penicillin was as good a prophylactic vaccine as could be developed. In an 1897 paper, they published that an antibiotic working as well as anti-bacterial would kill 120 times as many germs as a standard penicillin formulation. This was greatly aided by the discovery of diphtheria toxin, in which penicillin contained 5 parts of the toxin, while the standard penicillin contained around 2 parts. Agnew called for penicillin producers to be better prepared to develop new antibiotics, both for their own use and to research which antibiotics would be effective in higher cases. Because penicillin was not available to the US at the time, these calls led to Agnew and his associates being able to quickly produce their purified penicillin. Though the published paper was controversial, it became the first documented example of penicillin being given a popular prescription.When Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, Agnew joined with other major penicillin manufacturers in urging FDR to abolish the Division of Soils, a division that involved natural resources and imported chemicals. Agnew was concerned that this would have a very negative effect on the viability of the industry, as minerals and certain foreign chemicals were considered vital to the production and use of penicillin. Further, by removing pressure from the government, control of penicillin would have become more tightly controlled and would have left the industry with no option but to continue to provide inexpensive injections. Agnew was a strong advocate of the National Government League ( NGL ), a movement led by the World Anti-Fascist League ( WWA ), which opposed the Nazi takeover of Germany and argued that, if the Nazis did manage to take over Germany, it would make the new government effective at preserving the Jewish people, and should leave the United States free and open to global cooperation. Agnew and his NGL were appointed to a House committee in 1934, but their influence was limited as anti-Nazi forces dominated public opinion.  
   
   
 == Death and legacy ==  
 Agnew died at the age of 81 in 1937.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
 Agnew was the son of James and Catharine Agnew, and he married Mary Maud Ocher and had two daughters, Margaret ( born 1904 ) and Deborah ( born 1906 ). Agnew had three sons, Frank Agnew and William Walter Agnew, two brothers, Herbert A. and James Brian, and a sister, Ann.

 = Robert Hayne =  
Robert Hayne ( 17 May 1883, in London – 16 January 1973 ) was a British archaeologist who led excavations of palaeolithic sites in Yorkshire for over 20 years. He is credited with elucidating the relationship between these areas and the later Neolithic. He is best known for his successful excavations of nearby Wybarr Stone in the Yorkshire Channel.  
 Hayne was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and then spent some time at Calcutta Normal School before beginning his career. In 1898, he took part in the construction of the Bailey School, and his practical teaching of geology helped forge a lasting friendship with the school's headmaster, James Ritchie.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 In 1906, Hayne joined the Yorkshire Institute of Archaeology as a research assistant and was given a ten-month leave of absence to build the Bailey School ( now the Edward Archer School ). By 1913, he and Ritchie were both forced to resign from their posts over anti-social behaviour in the school.  
 Hayne's later excavations, however, were never wholly successful. In 1922–1923, he led the excavations at Shropshire, Meath and Shrewsbury where he continued to lead important excavations, which included several sites important to science. These included the first known ( at that time ) effigy of a Homo erectus from the prehistoric period, the first known human presence on a homogenous village, and a village cart and altar found in northern Shropshire. These discoveries allowed Hayne to believe that the site had once been used by nomadic hunter-gatherers as a prosperous trading town. This work, and Hayne's attempts to rebut the prevailing theory of the Stone Age, led to him being appointed a palaeolithic archaeologist to the British Museum in 1923, and he wrote the monograph Eruption of the Shropshire Site : The Shropshire Site, First appearing in 1937.In 1922–1925, Hayne led the excavation at Redhill, Kendal, near Leeds, where he named a suite of Neolithic rock types known as vesiculites ( that was the name by which they are usually known today ), the first species of rock and stone whose name had been established in English by William Wilson in 1905. Following the excavation of the city, he conducted further excavations at Leicester and Leicester's bay, further sequences at Wakefield, Sunderland, Shrewsbury, Wigglesworth and Bridgewater. He also led excavations at Guernsey, which opened in 1930.  
   
   
 == Other interests ==  
 In the 1920s, Hayne also wrote a series of popular and popular books and articles about archaeology and human history. He was a co-founder of the British Folklore Society and chaired its council for the next 27 years. He was a senior lecturer at Cambridge and was its vice-president from 1937 until 1951. He was also a co-founder and university organiser of the Archeological Society, and its president from 1959 until 1961. He received a knighthood from the Queen for his services to archaeology in the 1930s and the Procurator General of the British Museum, for services to archaeology during World War II.Hayne and Ritchie formed a close and lasting friendship, lasting until his death, during which time he encouraged Ritchie to publish his papers on the Stone Age, until Ritchie wrote them. Although Hayne enjoyed the company of many archaeologists, he was not granted permission to associate with any one particular person.

 = Daniel N. Jensen =  
Daniel Nehemiah Jensen ( November 23, 1863 – December 8, 1938 ) was an American metallurgist and engineer. He was noted for his work in refining galvanic and epithermal materials. He is best known for the concept of what he called `` magnetic coating '' which is a structural process whereby metal is coated with a molecular composition or layers of tiny electrons. This technique has been used to improve an engineer's ability to operate a machine or process and provide for high quality control.Jensen was born on November 23, 1863 in Denver, Colorado. His parents were Zora N. Jensen, a pioneer in bird breeding, and James Ronald Jensen, a pioneer in forest forestry. Daniel Jensen attended Rocky Mountain High School and attended the University of Denver College. Jensen completed a doctoral degree in chemistry and mechanical engineering from the University of Chicago in 1876.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Education and career ===  
 Jensen was a charter member of the Yale Football Club, which became the professional football team of the University of Colorado. In 1879, Jensen was appointed professor of metallurgy and metallurgy at the University of Denver. Jensen was a pioneer in the use of epithermal compounds to enhance steel corrosion resistance and also applied for patent 7,193,527 `` Magnetic Covering of Steel ''. This was the first patent granted to the U.S. in 1901.  
   
   
 === Discovery of magnetic coating ===  
 Jensen was also active as a long-distance runner and was known for his intense running regimen. He embarked on a seven-week road trip from Denver to San Francisco in May, 1882 and covered 120 miles in seven days. Jensen noticed that during his 60-mile trek he lost 10 pounds. Jensen spent over six months recording his findings using several logbooks, nearly doubling the number of hours of exertion at his disposal, and being advised by the scientific community to study this discovery closely. His work is now known to be the very first scientific research to explore the phenomenon of microspikes on solids, cement and ice. With the authority of his patents, Jensen and Henry Ramsay began the first research involving a microspike problem.  
   
   
 === More exciting discoveries ===  
 His contemporaries noticed Jensen's creative talent. The Boulder Herald-Journal wrote about `` the accidental discovery of a newly developed application of improved technique,'magnetic coating, '' stating that :  
   
 What gives Jensen special effect when applied to steel and other soft and brittle materials is his astuteness in using metallic and chemical barriers. These qualities and more are the result of a series of experiments on melted metals, cement and calcite.

 = Theodore Hall =  
Sir Theodore Hall, FRS ( 1829 – 2 April 1921 ) was a Scottish physicist who made contributions in the field of statistical mechanics. He published 13 papers on physics in the Journal of Applied Physiology, which he edited, and nine in the Physical Review.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Hall was born in Edinburgh to John Hamilton Hall, a surgeon, and his wife Hester Hall. He studied at King's College London, gaining his doctorate in 1858. In 1864 he joined Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, where he was head of the laboratory and junior lecturer in 1869–75. From 1876 until his retirement in 1917 he was an Associate Professor at the University of Edinburgh. In 1879 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1887 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Hall served as President of the Physical Society from its inception in 1883–84.  
   
   
 == Theories ==  
 Hall was influenced by Isaac Newton's Principia and James Clerk Maxwell's influential work in statistical mechanics. He suggested that statistical mechanics had the advantage of being fast and accurate, while classical mechanics was of little interest for the purpose of establishing how a small world operated. Hall saw that, although the quantity of particles was small, the amount of energy required to propel each particle was large, and the law of conservation of mass must be true, because as one particle traveled through a sphere, it lost energy from traveling backwards. This law must hold, in the case of a sphere, if all the particles in it exist in a single space, i.e., if the velocity of each particle as it travels through a circle increases linearly with the square of the radius. Thus, Hall's theorem can be expressed as

Paul ( Pablo ) Günther Lorentz ( 30 August 1835 – 6 October 1881 ) was a German-Argentine botanist .   
 Lorentz was born in Kahla , Thuringia . He initially studied theology at the Universities of Jena and Erlangen . From 1858 he studied botany at the University of Munich , where he was a pupil of Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli . He focused his attention towards the study of mosses , subsequently collecting specimens throughout Europe ( the Black Forest , the Austrian Alps , Switzerland , northern Italy and Scandinavia ) . With Wilhelm Philippe Schimper , he collaborated on Geographie der Moose.In 1870 he emigrated to Argentina , where he was appointed professor of botany at the University of Córdoba . In 1871–72 , he explored the mountainous regions of Tucumán and Catamarca provinces with geologist Alfred Wilhelm Stelzner ( 1840–1895 ) . Bryological specimens found on the expedition were kept for personal study by Lorentz , while vascular plants that he collected were sent to August Grisebach for further analysis , who described the vascular specimens in the treatise `` Plantae Lorentzianae '' ( 1874 ) .With his assistant , Georg Hieronymous , he conducted botanical investigations through the northern provinces of Jujuy and Salta , and into the lowlands of the Gran Chaco and Bolivia . Collections from this expedition were described by Grisebach ( along with Lorentz 's later collections from Entre Rios Province ) in the treatise `` Symbolae ad Floram Argentinam '' ( 1879 ) . His collection of lichens from the expedition were shipped to August von Krempelhuber and his Hepaticae specimens were sent to bryologist Karl Müller.In 1874 , due to political events , he relocated to Concepción del Uruguay as an instructor of natural history . In 1879 , with Gustavo Niederlein ( 1858–1924 ) , he participated in a scientific expedition across the Pampas to the Rio Negro . Lorentz died in Concepción del Uruguay at the age of 46 on 6 October 1881 , a victim of liver disease.As a result of his Argentine excursions , he collected many species of flowering plants , mosses and lichens that were new to science . Also , he is credited with providing the first phytogeographical map of Argentina .

 Mary was born in Kilbride, Herefordshire and began his career at Glasgow University, where he received a First Class Honours degree in 1916. He returned to Glasgow in 1919 to become a lecturer in mathematics and statistics there, a post he held until the early 1950s. He then moved to the UK to work at the University of Manchester and at King's College London. He became Professor of Statistics in 1931. He was Reader in Statistics at the University of Edinburgh in 1940 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. He held similar roles at the University of North London and Sheffield University. His achievements as a statistician include his assessment of the 'highly developed'inequalities of the Pearson correlation coefficient, in 1925, for the time period 1931–1933. He also proposed the concept of a super-value of parity in 1926 and, from 1950, at the United Nations Statistical Service ( UNESP ), created the standard measure of unemployment.Mary was an influential figure in the field of human physiology and nutrition, and his research was important for understanding how obesity was caused by, and to prevent, obesity.  
 His publications included ( together with J H Cole ) :  
   
 A Service for the Measurement of the Prevalence of Obesity in England and Wales ; and

 = Lucien G C3 A9las =   
Lucien Gélas ( 1 January 1873 or 12 January 1873 – 5 June 1944 ) was a luthier , classical guitarist , and teacher .   
 Gélas was born in Menton , Alpes Maritimes . He composed for solo guitar and as well as works for voice and guitar set to his own texts . Gélas owned the complete historic works of Sor as published by Meissonnier ( Paris 1820-36 ) and Pacini ( 1830–36 ) . The works are now a part of the Spencer Collection at the Royal Academy of Music in London .   
    
    
 == Gélas Guitar ( double-top guitar ) ==   
 Gélas is well known for inventing and patenting a guitar design which uses a double top : It is often called a Gélas guitar , or a double-top guitar ( or double-resonance-guitar ) and was common in the first half of the 20th century .   
 Gélas was awarded a Gold Medal at the Bordeaux Exhibition in 1907 and a Gold Medal at the Brussels Exhibition in 1910 for his double-top instruments.The two tops of the instruments have a resonating space between them . The inner top is not parallel to the outer one , such that the guitar can be observed to have a particular tilt . Also , the strings run through the bridge ( which is on the inner top ) and are attached at the bottom , in such a way that the plucked part of the string before the bridge is at an angle to the part of the string after the bridge . This is achieved by having the plucked part of the string slightly angled to the inner top ( in conventional guitar it would be parallel ) , resulting in a raised tension in the inner top .   
 The patent was first filed in Paris in 1905 ; and the patent text is downloadable in French and English.His guitars were played by numerous important artists , particularly in the first half of the 20th century . Heinrich Albert ( 1870–1950 ) obtained a Gélas guitar ( from Gaudet in Paris ) and ascribes his concert successes in a large part to the guitar , praising its carrying sound , ease of responsiveness , and tone-colour . Other players of Gélas guitars included Luise Walker ( 1910–1998 ) and Bruno Henze ( 1900–1978 ) .   
 Gélas produced the instruments with the help of guitar-makers ( following his patent ) , at first Théodore Gaudet and later Jean Roviès , Beuscher , Richard Jacob and others . The instruments included classical guitars , mandolins , jazz double-basses and Hawaiian guitars .

 = Stas Stoie Jellandj =  
Stas Jakob Jellandj ( Czech pronunciation : [ ˈʲas ˈjɑn. jɛlɑːj ˈjaːj ˈdʲɑːd ] ; 12 July 1871 in Česká Štiavnica – 23 October 1944 in Zagreb ) was a Slovenian anatomist who is best known for his research into the musculoskeletal system of the human body. He was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Academie Nationale de l'Académie de Médecine and the National Academy of Sciences of Latvia. He was known for his scientific analysis of the structure and function of skeletal muscles, the most prominent of which is the regulation of the epiphyseal muscles. He studied the cadaverous musculature and related structures of the human body, and subsequently performed studies into the physiology, pathophysiology, and pathological factors underlying this complex system. He was the author of numerous papers, the most notable of which, published in 1964, is History of the Epiphyseal Muscles, published in collaboration with Jost Jankowski, was a tribute to Jellandj.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
   
   
 === Early life ===  
 Born in Zagreb, Jellandj spent the first fifteen years of his life in Zagreb.  
   
   
 === Teaching ===  
 Jellandj graduated in 1899, with a doctorate degree in medicine from the University of Zagreb, becoming a lecturer in 1906, assistant professor of anatomy in 1912, and professor of physiology in 1924. He was made director of the department of anatomy and neurosurgery in Zagreb University in 1918.  
   
   
 === Medical practice ===  
 During World War I Jellandj served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, of which he was commissioned colonel. He returned to Zagreb in 1917, taking up the position of Professor of Surgery and Biophysics at the Faculty of Medicine of Zagreb University. In 1922, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal German Academy of Sciences, and the Croonian Society of Great Britain, where he remained until his death.  
   
   
 === Research ===  
 In 1923, Jellandj described the epiphyseal muscles in the molar region. He was interested in their history, the function of the muscles, and their interaction with the anatomical structures of the upper body. Jellandj's later research examined the pathophysiology of the epiphyseal muscles in patients with mesenteric diverticulitis, and he co-authored a book about the condition in collaboration with Jarkko Kotorović with a foreword by Carl Johan Kossuth, who was the first author of the controversial technique.  
 Jellandj's work has led to many improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of mesenteric diverticulitis, especially when compared to clinical and pathological factors. In 1970, he published Anatomical documentation of mesenteric diverticulitis ( 2nd edition ). In 1957, the first neurosurgical study and taxonomy of the epiphyseal muscles was completed and described by Jellandj. In 1993, the National Academy of Sciences of Latvia adopted the histologic classification of the epiphyseal muscles. In 1997, Jellandj authored a textbook about the epiphyseal muscles. In 2004, the first mesothelial cell culture system was constructed by his group. Jellandj published and contributed to the preprint of the book, Medical anatomy and biophysics, based on the book The anatomy and anatomy of musculature.  
 Jellandj worked in parallel with Jankowski to write a textbook on the origin and classification of musculature : Conformity and short-term plasticity in the skeletal muscle in its relation to the nervous system. He died in Zagreb on 23 October 1944.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 The epiphyseal musculature of the human body, the anterior and posterior portions of the connective tissue structures that form the bones of the lower limbs, and the third midline of the pelvis ( posterior fossa or piloedema ), have been named in his honor.

 As we have seen, eigenvalues of homotopy groups are local when the curvature of the equation is negative and the sum of its subgroups is positive. This is generally the case in fixed points. However, n-trees containing only edges are then of negligible degree of curvature because their non-n-separable part has large singularities, and therefore all other simplifications need to be performed as there are large numbers of partial derivatives of the derivatives. Such elimination is known as paucity-shaping.  
 In everyday functional analysis, small subgroups of a structure have ordered representations, as illustrated in

 = Ernst Hans Homann =  
Ernst Hans Homann ( 20 September 1880 – 22 February 1961 ) was a German theoretical physicist, author, and physiologist. He is credited with coining the term energy and with establishing a scientific theory of waves, galvanic effect, absorption of light by water, and the particle and wave analyzer theory. Homann invented the prism microscope, which was introduced by Charles Wheatstone in 1904, in his book `` Optics and Photometry. '' In 1921 Homann successfully demonstrated the existence of the Pauli–Ribbon effect, and he proved the existence of the Lamb shift in the quantum field theory. He believed the mass of electron vibrations for small particles, the Lorentz transform of these vibrations, and the Lorentz transformation of solutions of Hilbert space geometry were significantly smaller than the Planck length of their wavelength.

 Son of a teacher in Halle, Homann studied physics and mathematics at the Technical University of Munich, graduating in 1893. In 1905, at the age of 23, he became a laboratory assistant to Wolfgang Pauli. In 1908 Homann, along with his assistant Ernest Toussaint, showed that electron waves appear to have separate nuclei, which is as far from the prediction of special relativity as it was possible at that time to put forth. Homann's work contributed greatly to the field of electromagnetic theory and was cited by Friedrich Zinn in his theoretical derivation of the concept of `` systematic relativity ''. In 1921 he demonstrated the existence of the Pauli–Ribbon effect, a phenomenon that describes the phenomenon of induced resonances of phonons when they are distorted by an electric field. It is associated with the electric lens phenomena of optical transmission.  
 Homann was a founding editor of the journal Physikalische Zeitschrift.  
 In 1913 Homann was awarded a grant by the Munich Pharmacological Society to establish the Institute of Physiology in Munich. With the help of Paul Grün, he founded the Technical University of Munich-Chemical Institute of Biophysics and Pharmacology, now in its 25th year of existence.  
 After the outbreak of World War I, Homann made contributions to physics through experimental work in magnetism. In 1919 he was elected to membership of the Vertebrat in the German People's party ( DVP ), with the DVP becoming a separate electoral party in 1920. In 1922 Homann, along with Friedrich Schwarzschild, discovered the emission of X-rays with cesium. From 1924 Homann was a member of the newly formed Science and Education Commission for the first scientific congress of the Federation of German Scientists and Engineers.  
 After the reorganization of Germany in 1933, Homann became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and Humanities ( BAM ). After World War II, in 1948, he moved to the Niels Bohr Foundation for the study of the behaviour of nuclear fission. In 1957, he was invited by Richard Feynman to the International Astronomical Union at Göttingen for a five-day meeting on cosmic rays. In his years at the Niels Bohr Foundation, Homann developed his physics concepts, while studying with J. Pauli and in collaboration with Max Born. Later, he was an expert witness at the trial of Eugen von Braun and the resultant controversy over his work on atmospheric pressures.  
 After his death in 1961, his wife, Ethel Homann ( 1897–1975 ), is credited with developing one of the most popular gardening strategies of the 20th century in the first half of the 20th century, Homann's Rose Garden, an all-weeds garden that is presently one of the most popular gardens in the United States.

 = John Brady (geologist) =  
John Brady ( 11 September 1737 – 23 June 1831 ) was an English geologist, botanist, and poet. He was born at Breslau in western Germany, and died at Breslau.  
 In the middle of the 18th century, his writing was interred in the nearby Amberg cemetery, the remains of which are shown in the Natural History Museum.  
 Brady was a close friend of André Gide ( 1729-1818 ), father of Émile Gide ( 1772-1861 ). Émile was a researcher who visited Breslau in 1799, a year before Brady did, and shared several botanical specimens with him.  
 The phrase `` John Brady '' refers to André Gide and includes the surname Brady who had several children ; others named for him include Eli, Adolphe and Francis.  
 The species Bradyia is named for Brady.

 Wien developed the Wien filter ( also known as velocity selector ) in 1898 for the study of anode rays . It is a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that can be used as a velocity filter for charged particles , for example in electron microscopes and spectrometers . It is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed . The device is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields , such that particles with the correct speed will be unaffected while other particles will be deflected . It can be configured as a charged particle energy analyzer , monochromator , or mass spectrometer .   
 While studying streams of ionized gas , Wien , in 1898 , identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom . Wien , with this work , laid the foundation of mass spectrometry . J. J. Thomson refined Wien 's apparatus and conducted further experiments in 1913 then , after work by Ernest Rutherford in 1919 , Wien 's particle was accepted and named the proton .   
 In 1911 , Wien was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics `` for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat '' .

 == Career ==   
 Matthais Jacob Schleiden was born in Hamburg , Germany , on 5 April 1804 . His father was the municipal physician of Hamburg . Schleiden pursued legal studies   
 graduating in 1827 . He then established a legal practice   
 but after a period of emotional depression and an attempted suicide , he changed professions .   
 He studied natural science at the University of Göttingen in Göttingen , Germany , but transferred to the University of Berlin in 1835 to study plants . Johann Horkel , Schleiden 's uncle , encouraged him to study plant embryology.He soon developed his love for botany into a full-time pursuit . Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope . As a professor of botany at the University of Jena , he wrote Contributions to our Knowledge of Phytogenesis ( 1838 ) , in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells . Thus , Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry . He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus , discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown , and sensed its connection with cell division .   
 He became professor of botany at the University of Dorpat in 1863 . He concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from the one cell .

 = Caspar van der Som (composer) =  
Caspar van der Som ( 12 February 1826 – 13 January 1900 ) was a Dutch composer, conductor and music theorist who was the son of C. D. van der Som and a grandson of Henriette Knopf. He studied piano, singing, harmony, harmony and singing in America, and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws in 1868.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Rotterdam ( Dutch pronunciation : [ ˈaʒúslɛ ] ), now part of the city of Rotterdam. He was the eldest of eight children. His father, a piano virtuoso and a pupil of Schoenberg, had taught his elder brother, Auguste van der Som, to play the piano. It was also during this period that van der Som was deeply interested in music, having heard the lectures of two legendary scholars, Johann Jakob Pring ( 1685-1715 ) and Robert Schumann ( 1693-1759 ), and was playing the harpsichord at about the age of five. He also drew a constant curiosity for music, studied it as a child, and afterwards studied it in Europe as a young man.  
 On the death of his father, van der Som inherited from his uncle the half-brothership of Louis van der Som, the brother of the mathematician Albert, whose mathematical work was one of van der Som's interests. Van der Som went on to study with Pring at the University of Jena, where he wrote his first music in 1893, one year after completing his doctorate. He studied in Jena with Kullback and studied music theory at the University of Leipzig with Matthias Radeck from 1898. He received a degree from Leipzig in 1903, with the dissertation Traité d'études de l'amour instrumentale, in which he analysed the function of the hand and the internal organs of a musical instrument. In 1901, he was appointed professor at the University of Amsterdam under K. Huse.In 1904 he married Nelly Schutte in Leiden, becoming a professor at the Amsterdam Conservatory in 1906. He was the composer of some 20 performances of his son's Ballet Fantasy, for which his book Miracles was published in 1908. That year he began composing, and his scores were edited by Jan van der Oudt, who was a musical admirer of van der Som's.  
   
 From 1909 to 1918 van der Som was Principal of the University of Amsterdam, and director of the Amsterdam Cathedral Choir from 1920. In the 1910s, he gave more popular concerts and was strongly influenced by the music of Wagner and Schubert. Van der Som died in Utrecht in 1900. He is commemorated in his obituary in Musical Times ( 1911 ). He had a daughter, Marianne Hjort-van de Velden, who became a noted soloist, composer and art historian.

 = Jos C3 A9vors Christensen =  
Josávors Christensen ( 1797–1884 ) was a Norwegian zoologist and the first director of the Natural History Museum in Oslo. He was Professor of Zoology at the University of Oslo from 1824 to 1838. He is remembered for the textbook Evolution of the Animal Kingdom ( 1824–1838 ), one of the most frequently used books in scientific zoology of that time.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 He was born in Bævik and attended the Lutheran church. He had a pioneering scientific career, and was a founder and director of the zoological department at the University of Oslo from 1824 to 1838. At the beginning of 1826, when the Danish king Frederick Augustus von Nordenskjöld introduced his system of scientific taxonomy and culture to Norway, he began by translating the works of Olaus Magnus ( to whom he belonged ), by Pausanias, Enthrallius, Carl Linnaeus, and Aveling, and prepared a codex for his collection. Around 1831, he also started to produce birds, together with a large number of fishes.  
 A modest man, he was educated to become a pastor. After obtaining his doctorate, he went to Copenhagen and was a superintendent for the purchase of fish. He became friendly with the schoolmaster Ingald Lundell.He was twice elected president of the Royal Norwegian Society. From 1832 until 1836, he served as the first director of the Zoological Museum. In 1835 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Oslo, but instead of continuing this position, in 1845 he resigned and relocated to Copenhagen, as director of the Natural History Museum. He also published a comprehensive monograph of the structures of the bird brain, entitled “ Nordbladetende blajtet ”, to which he was appointed a life member in 1848.  
   
   
 == Publications ==  
 A brief account of some of the zoological discoveries made by him is given in the essay Pasaarbunde sormelsem ( 1824 ), in which he comments on some of the earlier problems and points of departure from zoology and anatomy. He himself presented a proof of the laws of thermodynamics for the vertebrate body, and presented his results to a public exhibition in Copenhagen. In a letter to Petter Christoffer Holm and to his brother Enzo, F.F., he denied that carbon was the ultimate cause of motion in the vertebrate body, and argued that muscle originates from molecules of water. A second attempt was made by this opponent to rehabilitate F.F. Holm's original theory of muscles. In this attempt, Helge Moltke, being appointed curator of the zoological museum, opposed the authors of the book, asserted the anatomical connection between meat and tissue, and suggested that `` other liquors, such as wine, should be invented in order to render the body suitable for digestion ''.Having obtained his PhD from the University of Copenhagen, he acted for a time as director of the Pragenschuleschool in Copenhagen. From 1839 to 1846, he was a professor of zoology at the University of Oslo. Between 1845 and 1848, he served as the first director of the Zoological Museum.

 Chevillard studied the dialects of Native Americans and served as director of a school for Native Americans. He argued that groups of Indigenous people on the North American continent spoke `` North Americanized '' languages. The aim of his thesis, published in 1902 as Qu'est-ce que les Hois en Afrique Indépendance? ( `` Where are the people of the North American continent and of the North African continent speaking the same language? '' ), was to demonstrate the dominance of the Old World languages over what he thought were `` continental '' ones in native North American languages, notably with regards to Qu'est-ce que les Hautes Paroles. He made considerable contributions to ethnological research, such as his writing the Dictionary of Aboriginal America ( 1914 ) and the Americanity of Nations ( 1936 ).  
 Chevillard's work on language has received a great deal of attention and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1918. He was the author of three books.

 = William William Lowndes =  
William William Lowndes ( 5 February 1771 – 3 January 1849 ) was an English politician, politician and pioneer physician in rural England. He is credited with originating the inoculation of livestock for medical purposes.  
 Lowndes was born in Sunderland, Middlesex, and is regarded as one of the pioneers of early modern medicine. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Liverpool, and at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and also practiced at St Thomas's Hospital and St Mary's Hospital. He held many ministerial positions in England, including the late William Petty.  
 He described vaccines and applied medicine extensively, and contributed to the physiological theories of the physician Francis Marion. For twenty years, he served as Secretary of the Bodleian Society.  
 In 1792, Lowndes was elected President of the Committee on Medical Education of Parliament, and was given the task of creating a national library, complete with an ancient manuscript on England's ancient royal library and an admixture of botanical books. This project was taken up in 1794 by Henry James, but the proposals were rejected due to royal disapproval. This failure of James'project resulted in the New and better method of preserving materiel, which Lowndes and James developed in 1809. In 1815 he published `` History of Medicine '', a book which was to prove a precursor to the clinical writings of Robert Jackson. He also authored 1859, ( the standard historian ), `` Life of Dr. Thomas Midland '' ( revised with additions in 1967 ), `` Rural Surgery '', and `` The Legal Profession '' ( revised with amendments in 1972 ).

 = Helen Lee =  
Helen Lee FRS FRSE ( 14 August 1885 – 8 November 1968 ) was a British statistician who specialised in the life tables, and later particularly on the life tables. She founded the Life Tables Society.  
   
   
 == Life Tables ==  
 Lee first devised the, and promoted, the `` life tables '', the first collection of these tables which gave detailed information on various aspects of health and survival of those with various medical conditions. In 1913 she added detail about physical health for miners, the minimum level of drinking water required for health and metabolic strength for pregnant women, and so on.  
 Lee's life tables became the basis of statistical methods and research from the 1920s to the 1950s. At the time, World War I was raging, and there was a need to research what a war based on war would mean for the populations in other parts of the world. However, Lee considered such calculations in any force to be impractical, because populations in war zones also lived in different environments which would affect the health of their populations, and all data from places in the war zones was vital to future generations to help make any scientific predictions.Lee and her husband, Thomas Emery Lee, conceived of the subject based on her experience of being sick and in constant need of the emergency hospital. Lee had to measure movement of vital organs throughout her body. These vital statistics she was able to obtain from patients were essential to the development of war rationing during World War I and later. The methods she devised became known as the Emery and Lee's decision theory.  
   
   
 == Awards and honours ==  
 Lee was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1921 and became a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( 1921 ), Foreign Member of the Linnean Society ( 1924 ), and Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( 1925 ). In 1950, she was appointed a Companion of the Order of the British Empire.  
 In 1975 Lee was elected to the Queen ’ s Birthday Honours list for public services in `` Peace, Women ’ s and the World, the British Department of International Affairs and the United Nations,'s. '' Her 100th birthday is celebrated annually on 20 May.  
 Lee was married to the anthropologist and psychiatrist Arthur J. Lee. She had a son, the psychologist and physiologist Edward J. Lee, and a daughter, the pianist Nancy S. Lee.

 == Early life and education ==  
 Royer was born on February 17, 1915, in Hertford, to George Donald and Dora ( née Moore ) Royer. In 1934, he enrolled at the University of Birmingham to study physics, but found his interest for mathematics and later quantum mechanics, and did not finish it. He attended Glasgow University, where he met with Albert Einstein, and went on to study at the University of Edinburgh in 1938.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 At Edinburgh, Royer met Niels Bohr and worked on their theories of nuclear fission. Royer also conducted experiments that showed the occurrence of heavy elements in rocks using the case of atomic nuclei. Royer then published a paper on a graphical description of Brownian motion in the atmosphere. His theory of Brownian motion was independently researched by J C Haldane, William Seabrook, Alfred Mersenne, and Fritz Strassmann. When asked about Royer's work in science, Georg Cantor stated that he was `` a great friend '' of Royer.  
   
   
 == Scientific writings ==  
 Royer wrote several books and papers on general physics, such as Systematic Theories of Nuclear Theory ( 1940 ) and The Theory of Fluids ( 1944 ), both co-authored with Guido Banach. Other publications included The Theory of Irradiation ( 1957 ) and The Structure of the Environment ( 1962 ). With others, he tried to make data-based laws regarding the behaviour of fission and nuclear decay.

This was followed by a series of research positions in London , Bristol and Exeter before she took on the position of Lecturer in Medical Statistics at St. Marys Hospital Medical Schooin l 1983 . While with the hospital Wadsworth contributed to several clinical studies , inclining a study of pelvic pain syndrome with Professor Richard Beard and the Nation Childhood Encephalophathy Study with Professor David Miller .   
 When the Aids epidemic arrived , Wadsworth became involved in determining the pattern of the HIV infection throughout Britain . This was the first attempt to conduct a study about sexual behaviour in the UK and gave Jane Wadsworth the opportunity to take the leading role in initiating her own research programme for the first time . During this period , Wadsworth 's personal life became more strained , however , and her marriage broke up in the late 1980s.After several years of laying the foundations for sex research , Wadsworth , together with Julia Field , Anne Johnson and Kaye Wellings , embarked on a national study during which they interviewed 18,876 men and women about their sex lives . The study was filmed by Horizon for television and the women briefly found themselves in the eye of the media.In 1994 , Wadsworth and her fellow researcher published Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle detailing the results of the survey . A version of this , Sexual Behaviour in Britain , was serialised in the Independent on Sunday .

Walther Kruse ( September 8 , 1864 - 1943 ) was a German bacteriologist who was a native of Berlin .   
 In 1888 he received his doctorate from Berlin , where he was a student of Rudolf Virchow ( 1821-1902 ) . From 1889 until 1892 he worked as a bacteriologist in Naples , and in 1892 travelled to Egypt to perform research on dysentery . In 1893 he became an assistant to hygienist Carl Flügge ( 1847-1923 ) in Breslau , and in 1898 became an associate professor at the University of Bonn . Later he served as a full professor in Königsberg ( 1900 ) , Bonn ( 1911 ) and Leipzig ( 1913 ) .   
 Walther Kruse is remembered for his work in parasitology and his research of intestinal bacteria infections . He performed extensive studies of Shigella dysenteriae during an epidemic of dysentery in the Ruhr area of Germany . This organism is sometimes referred to as the `` Shiga-Kruse bacillus '' , and its associated disease as `` Shiga-Kruse dysentery '' . These eponyms are shared with Japanese bacteriologist Kiyoshi Shiga ( 1871-1957 ) . Kruse documented his findings in a 1900 treatise titled Über die Ruhr als Volkskrankheit und ihren Erreger .   
 In 1914 he demonstrated that the common cold could be transmitted to healthy individuals via nasal secretions that were free of bacteria . The results of these experiments were published in a treatise called Die Erreger von Husten und Schnupfen ( 1914 ) . A specialized tool used to spread material over the surface of a culture medium is called `` Kruse 's brush '' .

His publications include Revolutions in Ecological Structure, a textbook on ecological evolution. He also co-authored The Evolutionary Place of a Landscape with James H. Gilson, a book that has been compared to John Muir's The Wilderness as a Landscape, referring to how landscape ecologists have 'evolved'in non-human animal forms to adapt to such environmental stresses. The book was reviewed by David Livingstone as a `` masterpiece.

 == Life ==   
 He was the fourth and youngest son of the Rev . Zachariah Mudge , by his first wife , Mary Fox , and was born at Bideford , Devon . He was educated at Bideford and Plympton grammar schools , and studied medicine at Plymouth Hospital .   
 Several invitations were made to Mudge to try his fortunes in London . But he preferred to remain at Plymouth , where he practised for the remainder of his life , first as surgeon , and , after 1784 , when he received the degree of M.D . from King 's College , Aberdeen , as a physician .   
 Mudge inherited a friendship with the family of Sir Joshua Reynolds , and when in 1762 Samuel Johnson accompanied Reynolds on his visit to Plymouth , Johnson became a friend and consulted Mudge as a physician . Another intimate friend was John Smeaton . Other allies and guests of Mudge were James Ferguson , the astronomer , and James Northcote , originally a chemist 's assistant , who owed him his position in Reynolds 's studio .   
    
    
 == Telescopes ==   
 On 29 May 1777 Mudge was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society , and in the same year was awarded the Copley medal for his ‘ Directions for making the best Composition for the Metals for reflecting Telescopes ; together with a Description of the Process for Grinding , Polishing , and giving the great Speculum the true Parabolic Curve , ’ which were communicated by the author to the society , and printed in the Philosophical Transactions ( 1777 , lxvii . 296 ) . The ‘ Directions ’ were also issued separately by Bowyer ( London , 1778 ) . Sir John Pringle , the president , in making the presentation , remarked that Isaac Newton had predicted the role of mechanical devices in making parabolic mirrors .   
 The manufacture of telescopes continued to occupy much of his spare time . He made two large ones with a magnifying power of two hundred times ; one of these he gave to Hans Moritz von Brühl , and it passed to the Gotha Observatory , the other descended to his son William Mudge .

He collected at least 80,000 plant samples while walking across nearly all of the Soviet Union including the most remote regions of Russia and adjacent republics . He traveled in many other countries , including Northern and Central Europe , the United States , India , and China . The establishment of the Herbarium at the Main Botanical Garden in Moscow as a world-class depository with a vast foreign exchange program is largely due to Skvortsov 's efforts . He also made additions to the living collection of the   
 Main Botanical Garden . His approach toward botany and evolution inspired him to undertake experimental work in plant introduction . Together with a team of colleagues and students , he successfully worked on domesticating and improving the taste of blue honeysuckles ( Lonicera Section Caerulea ) . He also developed a cultivar of an apricot hardy in Moscow . Skvortsov played a role as a conservation advocate proposing and facilitating the establishment of a new national park in his homeland , Kaluga Oblast and Smolensk Oblast of Central European Russia .

 == Career ==  
 Dennis Harrison was born in San Diego, California, the second of three children born to Harriet Bennett Harrison, an opera singer, and Gerald Harrison. The youngest, George, was killed in a car accident when he was ten. After graduating from high school in 1926, he started to study law, becoming an associate and then an associate judge at the San Diego Bar Association. Harrison was appointed to the bar in 1937, and the following year to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit. He served as a deputy for the appeals division of the U.S. Department of Commerce from 1937 to 1942 and, in 1941, was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After the war, he moved to Washington to assume the position of director of the NWS's main weather office in the District, remaining there until 1969.  
   
   
 === Role at NWS ===  
 Harrison was designated director of the National Weather Service in October 1942, replacing Edward C. Guthrie. During the early part of World War II, Harrison was president of the weather section of the National Federation of the Arts and in 1944 he joined the editorial staff of the magazine The Washington Evening Star.  
 After the war, Harrison became director of the United States Coast Guard Weather Service, a position that he held from February 1947 until his death. He was reelected to the office in 1953. As director of the Weather Bureau, he conducted a series of weather forecasting trips to the coasts of North America in the 1930s and 1940s that are still used to this day. In 1952, Harrison was awarded the Edgar C. Breitkopf Medal by the Royal Meteorological Society.  
   
   
 === Death ===  
 Harrison succumbed to the effects of multiple sclerosis shortly after being announced as director of the National Weather Service in April 1994.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 The Dennis M. Harrison Award ( 1959 ), a weather forecasting prize established by the National Weather Service and the United States Coast Guard Weather Service, is awarded annually to the best amateur and senior member of the meteorology profession.  
   
   
 == Literature ==  
 Interest in medical history of professional weather forecasters are characterized by a change from the older emphasis on `` chronological annals '' to `` clinical histories ''. This shift occurs mainly because the focus of medical history in meteorology is increasingly on pathology, only possibly a component of meteorology ( Cohen, 1994 ).

His many achievements include participation in the first demonstration of phase stability , the development of the first synchrocyclotron and the first sector-focused cyclotron.Richardson grew up in Vancouver until his family emigrated to the US in 1922 . He studied physics at UCLA and was a doctoral student in nuclear physics of Ernest Orlando Lawrence at the University of California , Berkeley , receiving his PhD in 1937 . After a year at the University of Michigan , he became Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois . From 1942 he worked on electromagnetic isotope separation for the Manhattan Project in Berkeley and Oak Ridge ( calutron ) . In 1946 , after the discovery of the phase stability and the synchrotron principle by Weksler and Edwin McMillan , he collaborated with a group of physicists consisting of Ed Lofgren , Ken MacKenzie , Bernard Peters , Fred Schmidt and Byron Wright in converting the fixed-frequency 37-inch cyclotron at Berkeley to the first synchrocyclotron . This success not only provided the first demonstration of the phase-stability principle but also confirmed the feasibility of converting the large Berkeley 184-inch cyclotron from a classical cyclotron to a synchrocyclotron.An even bigger sector cyclotron with energies up to 520 MeV was built by Richardson 's line at TRIUMF in Vancouver . From 1971 to 1976 , Richardson was the director of the laboratory , where he oversaw the construction of the cyclotron .   
 In 1991 he received the Robert R. Wilson Prize .

Yvonne Olen ( May 6, 1886 in Paris - December 11, 1981 in Bremen ) was an American neurologist, best known for introducing the concept of temporal lobe epilepsy.In addition to her work as a medical doctor, she was a member of the faculty of the University of Bremen, in which her students included French neurologist Eugène Merrier. She died of liver cancer in Bremen in 1981, aged 82.  
   
   
 == Early years ==  
 Yvonne Olen was born in Paris to a wealthy Jewish family in 1887. She was educated in France, Germany, and Switzerland and obtained a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1932. Later in life, she had a conflict with her husband, who was a neurologist. He argued with her about her expertise and her romantic life. Olen lost control of herself and began having epileptic seizures.Olen's parents did not have a particularly active Jewish lifestyle. Her father was an industrialist, but was a controversial figure ; both he and his wife suffered a succession of illnesses that put their children's lives in danger. Because of her father's financial conflicts, his physicians were hired mainly to provide health insurance for his children.Initially, Olen was much better qualified than her husband. She had an outsize interest in learning, going so far as to write a textbook for her daughters in neurology. As a teenager, she gave an award at the Marie Curie Festival at Paris, during the World War I, to the daughter of General Alfred von Stockhausen. It was referred to as the `` honorary medal '' and was `` paid by the whole department of neurology ''.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
 After leaving the University of Paris in 1934, she worked as an assistant to Professor Alfred Huguenin in the University of Bremen. By the time she was appointed as a full professor in 1949, she had trained an additional 25 neurologists and had more than 300 students. At the university, she also published 10 books and several articles. Olen joined the faculty of the University of Bremen in 1953. She remained there until she retired in 1980.  
   
   
 == Legacy ==  
 When her results were published in 1959 in the Journal of the Royal Neurological Institute in England, Olen's work was hailed as the first evidence for the existence of a temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. However, even at this time, the prevailing notion was that ankylosing spondylitis ( a common form of neurology ) was the underlying cause of epileptic seizures. Olen was one of the first scientists to refer the causes of the cause, which were made public after years of intensive editing. Her work is still used to this day as a reference for researchers studying the etiology of temporal lobe epilepsy. In the last four decades, research has uncovered a wealth of scientific evidence that implicates prolonged periods of sleep deprivation in causing epileptic seizures.In 1976, British neurologist and orthopedic surgeon and political activist James Millar told of an encounter he had with Olen on a Saturday afternoon in 1954 : `` She was a great friend. She was even more brilliant at recovering from her epileptic episodes. I 'd be in jail if I knew how to deal with her. `` The American Journal of Medicine has listed Olen among the leading 25 people to have been instrumental in the development of the Testicular hypertrophy syndrome.

 = Ilya Gergievich Guldi =  
Ilya Guldi ( June 17, 1910 – September 19, 1986 ) was a Russian economist, mathematician, and Professor of Economics at the Moscow State University ( MSU ). Guldi's major work was on special relativity and inflation.  
   
   
 == Life and work ==  
 Guldi graduated from Moscow State University ( MSU ) with a B.S. degree in 1930. In 1932 he was offered a position at the MSU by V.I. Chernyshevsky and L.A. Guldi. Guldi defended a thesis on `` History of the dynamics of money and price '' in 1934. In 1934 he joined the Moscow Economic Institute and did research on banking and insurance. In 1938, at the invitation of Imperial Russia, Guldi returned to Russia. He was the chairman of the committee of the Government of the Russian Federation to prepare `` a strong economic and statistical organization ''. The committee met in 1943 and 4 years later formed the Central Committee of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which Guldi served in until his death.  
 Guldi, together with A.G. Nabyshevsky and V.I. Chernyshevsky, together with other experts from the Moscow Economic Institute, developed statistical methods and methods of calculating the rates of interest and the interest component of the price.  
   
   
 == Theories and demonstrations ==  
 During World War II, Guldi demonstrated the statistical method of computing the rate of interest in collaboration with V.I. Chernyshevsky. A model of Russian economy was developed for accounting purposes which relied on statistical methods.  
 In an analysis of the first period of the Bank of Russia gold reserves ( 1949–1956 ), Guldi made the following observations. According to the average of a number of economists, by the beginning of 1955 the gold reserves were 2,498,000 lire and the rate of interest was 5.22 percent. Guldi concluded that :  
   
 In the first half of 1955, at the present rate of interest, Russia will hold approximately 70 percent of the world reserves.In February 1956, during a visit to the Moscow Academy of Economics, Guldi developed the theory of storage of funds in the central bank of the USSR. For this purpose he was the first to measure the relative rigidity of the `` money reserve '' of the central bank, which is simply the fractional reserve of the reserves of the other bank.  
   
   
 == Taxation ==  
 In one of the lectures, which was published by the Central Committee of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1988, he and a young economist Mikhail Gorney ( in 1928–29 when Gorney was the author of the `` neo-Marxism '' literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences ) elaborated and demonstrated the information economy, which had become the leading force of social development in the USSR. The concept of money `` storage '' and the concept of goods-changers ( i.e. goods that result from taking a monetary value and keeping it as a unit of account ) were introduced by him. They were combined in a new system of prices for goods and services.  
 Guldi distinguished four basic principles of practical theory :  
   
 price has its own value  
 prices have an inherent non-fractional basis  
 the free market maintains the system of prices in its institutions ( means of exchange, barter etc. )  
 the constant supply of prices leads to a stationary equilibrium of prices  
 prices are commonly calculable by an integrated flow-rate equation  
 prices follow the same sequence ( supply, demand, part and parcel )  
 the sale of a commodity does not change its value but only leads to its substitution in another commodity.In addition to this, Guldi introduced the concept of the Internet of Things ( then still in the testing stage ) which was much important to many people during the period of the Cyberworld.

 = Nicolaas Kruik =   
Nicolaas Samuelszoon Kruik ( Latin : Nicolaus Samuelis Cruquius ; 2 December 1678 , West-Vlieland – 5 February 1754 , Spaarndam ) , also known as Klaas Kruik and Nicolaes Krukius , was a Dutch land surveyor , cartographer , astronomer and weatherman . He is remembered most today for the Museum De Cruquius bearing his name .   
 He was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in Fahrenheit from 1706 to 1734 . His historical calculations are still used today by the KNMI , the Dutch meteorological institute . He not only measured weather changes in wind speed , rainfall , air pressure , temperature , and humidity , but also measured sea level . His method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth ( isobaths ) in his map of the Merwede ( 1728 ) was the first of its kind . He was an advocate of pumping out the Haarlemmermeer ( Haarlem lake ) , which was done a century after his death .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
 He became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps , a lucrative job in his day . Though born in Vlieland , he moved to Delft a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations . In 1717 at the age of 39 , though firmly established as a respected surveyor , he moved to the family farm in Rijnsburg outside Leiden and chose to study in Leiden under Herman Boerhaave , at that time the most famous scientist in the Netherlands . He signed himself in as `` Krukius , medical student , born in Delft '' . Thanks to Boerhaave , Kruik became a member of the Royal Society of London . The secretary of the Royal Society at that time , James Jurin , started the first European network of meteorological weather stations , and the Dutch members played a large part . Kruik was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1724.In 1721 and 1723 Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli travelled to Holland and he and Boerhaave stimulated Kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health . Kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the Netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work . On these trips he was sometimes accompanied by Boerhaave and Marsigli . While studying the Merwede , he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the Netherlands dry .   
 It was at this time that Kruik changed his name to the Latin Cruquius after his first publications of maps and measurements . In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to Willem 's Gravesande , a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden , proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands . This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the United Provinces to create a water defence plan in 1727 . It was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of Haarlemmermeer bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later .   
    
 In 1733 he became a member of the 'Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland ' , the Dutch Waterboard Agency , and worked as a Waterboard inspector in Spaarndam . It was here that he met Jan Noppen ( 1706–1734 ) , the Halfweg inspector , who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in Zwanenburg with measurements 3 times daily of temperature , air pressure , humidity , and rainfall .   
 An eccentric man , Kruik wrote music , and had an obsessive need to measure things . This need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily . According to contemporary accounts , only Boerhaave could successfully work with him .

 = Lucas Maius =   
Lucas Maius ( also Mai , May , Majus ) ( October 14 , 1522 in Römhild – 4 or 5 March 1598 in Kassel ) was a German Protestant pastor who converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism , and playwright during the Protestant Reformation .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Lucas Maius was born in Römhild in 1522 , to mill owner Michael May and his wife , Martha Dörrer . In his early years , he moved with his parents to Hildburghausen , as his father took part in the German Peasants ' War . There , he attended school in the winters , helping with the farmwork in the summer months . He learned a simple job as tailor . In 1548 , he completed his studies at the University of Wittenberg , where he had attended lectures by Philipp Melanchthon . In 1549 , he traveled to Silesia , Prussia , Poland , Denmark and Holland .   
 In 1550 , he became a schoolteacher , and after his marriage in 1551 , he became principal of the school in Hildburghausen .

In 1568 , he became senior pastor in Rudolstadt , and he went in the fall of 1575 as senior pastor and Superintendent of St. Mary 's Church in Halle , Saxony-Anhalt . In that capacity , he signed the 1577 Formula of Concord in Wolmirstedt , though suspicion fell on him of being a Crypto-Calvinist.In 1577 , Maius hosted Jakob Andreae , Nicholas Selnecker , and other fellow Reformation pastors at Halle , where they developed a sort of philosophical conundrum known as the 'Devil 's Cross ' ( Teufels kreutz ) that was said to have turned numerous parishioners away from the devil . It was explained as follows :   
 He became involved in the constant dispute over Article VIII ( on the Person of Christ ) , and because of some statements he allegedly had made against the Concord , was interrogated by the Administrator of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg , Joachim III Frederick , Elector of Brandenburg . Seeing no prospects in Halle , he was dismissed from his post in 1579 , converted to the Reformed faith , and took a position as second pastor in Kassel Altstadt .

Doula Huleby ( January 19, 1848, in Minneapolis, Minnesota – July 22, 1908, in Plattsburgh, New York ) was an American educator.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Huleby was born on January 19, 1848 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and graduated from the Minneapolis School of Arts and Sciences in 1876. She taught mathematics at Ball State University from 1877 to 1885, and after that she held teaching appointments in Chicago, Oregon, New York, and Minnesota. In 1893 she became instructor of the second grammar school in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where she was named principal in 1895. While teaching there, Huleby conducted experiments on women teachers, with the result that women now held considerable sway at the Pine Bluff School, and remained in that position until her retirement in 1909.As a mathematical teacher, Huleby wrote several mathematical textbooks for the use of students. In the first published textbook, Elementary Algebraic Number Concepts ( 1910 ), she suggested that the focus of the algebra was on processes, not sequences. A second published book, The Elementary Algebraic Theory of Quaternions ( 1913 ), was a study of infinite pairs, reducing them to compact rectangles by rearranging the ordinary differential equations for them to include abstract algebraic relations. She continued this tradition in 1922, with a book, The Mathematical Treatise of Functions of Differential Numbers ( in two parts ). Also in 1922 she published a fourth textbook, Formulas and Methods of Algebraic Number Theory. While in Minnesota she published articles on the history and theory of numbers, some of these were influential in American education, such as her 1923 book What The Numbers Mean?.  
   
   
 == Select writings ==  
 Huleby published many books, including The Elementary Algebraic Theory of Quaternions and Elementary Types, a textbook of the kind she had designed, and The Mathematical Treatise of Functions of Differential Numbers. She was also a proponent of functional analysis, and wrote on algebraic functions in general and the three-body problem in particular. Huleby published several articles that were significant in their time : articles in the Journal of Applied Mathematics in 1900, the Journal of the American Statistical Association in 1903, The Annals of the Mathematics Series of the American Mathematical Society in 1905, and The Annals of Mathematics in 1911.

Otto Wilhelm Friedrich von Dehnius ( German : [ ˈoʁtər frɨntʁv jɪnju ] ; 28 June 1745 – 25 June 1805 ) was a German astronomer and astronomer, born at Egersdorff in 1813. He was a lieutenant-colonel in the Prussian Empire. Dehnius wrote A Prophetic Ascent and Vindication, but little else.  
 Dehnius is remembered for proposing his quadrant law ( Vindication ) to one of his superiors, Johann Abraham Dirick. This proposal was based on the axiom of partial differential equations. Dehnius, a Prussian politician, was elected to the Prussian Parliament, and the law became part of German astronomy.  
 The law also explained the rotation and eccentricity of the Earth, and as a later discovery disproved some of the famous comet theories of that time.  
 Dehnius had originally developed his idea in a mathematics paper, but the new law found its way into more serious scientific discussion in 1803. The proof of the law became a widely publicized phenomenon. Many geocachers maintained high standards, and in the 1820s Dehnius was given medals of honour by other states.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
   
 Otto Wilhelm Friedrich von Dehnius was born in Egersdorff, Prussia ( now Königsberg ) on 28 June 1745, the second son of Johann Abraham Dehnius ( 1705–1781 ) and his wife Susanne. His father worked at an ophthalmological clinic, and died when Otto was twelve.The family lived in Dresden and Vienna, where Dehnius developed a keen interest in mathematics, natural philosophy and astronomy, and was elected to the Vienna House of Commons in 1766. During his stay in Vienna he met and befriended Rudolf von Kirchhoff, Isaac Newton, Julius Evola, and other prominent philosophers. His name was eventually used by William Herschel to make his Comets of 1814 and 1815.  
 Dehnius received his B.S. ( 1769 ) in mathematics from University of Vienna and his M.D. ( 1774 ) from the University of Leipzig, where he was an assistant physician. In 1782 he was elected to the house of commons in Prussia, which replaced the lower chamber of the same name, which was largely controlled by Prussian nobility. He then took up residence in Leipzig. In Leipzig he conducted astronomical studies under his mentor Kirchhoff ( 1752–1829 ), and in 1787, published his first book, a work in progress in philosophy and astronomy, with an extra chapter on astronomy as applied to metallurgy. Von Dehnius soon became de facto inspector of the astronomy at Leipzig, and the city's annexation to the Prussian Republic, allowing him to take full and direct control of astronomy there, was the end of his political career. He retired from politics and returned to Leipzig.  
 Dehnius lived at Leipzig for the rest of his life, and his duties at Leipzig enabled him to learn what is known today as stellararithmetic, the study of eclipses and coronal transformations, beginning in the mid-1780s. During this time he also worked on the `` Leipzig Syndrome ''. This term is sometimes used to describe the night sky's oblateness. He also did calculations using equations, such as the Fourier series, which provided illumination in his book Ästhetische Begriff des Natur in der Physik.  
   
 Dehnius published all of his works in Leipzig, Berlin, Strasbourg, and Bonn. He died in Bonn, at the age of 69, during the second voyage of the world's first torpedo boat, the Fritz Plan, on 25 June 1805. A crater on the Moon is named after him.

Kearfott was educated in primary schools in Richmond and Philadelphia and was connected with the Morton Poole Company and the International Navigation Company in his early career . Kearfott was also associated with the Worthington Steam Pump Company and was considered an authority on his branch of engineering.Kearfott also worked on Lepidoptera , especially Tortricidae and built up a large collection .   
 Kearfott had a peculiar approach to naming new species , using a very orderly , alphabetical fashion , resulting in specific names such as : bobana , cocana , dodana , etc . Because Kearfott 's names were published in widely distributed scientific journals and his species were adequately described and diagnosed , his names are valid . However , his naming practices were not deemed appropriate by other entomologists ; Edward Meyrick even responded to Kearfott 's work with a paper called `` On some impossible scientific names in Micro-Lepidoptera '' , published in 1912 . In this paper Meyrick described Kearfott 's names as `` openly and obviously based on a barbarous and unmeaning gibberish . '' Meyrick rejected Kearfott 's names and proposed new `` appropriate '' Latin names to replace them . Because the names are valid however , this led to the creation of many synonyms.His collection of Tortricidae is now in the American Museum of Natural History , while his collection of Pyralidae went to the William Barnes collection , which is now at the Smithsonian .

August Theodore Dillman ( September 14, 1882, Easton, Pennsylvania – July 25, 1968, Penn ) was a Methodist and pastor of the Unitarian church in Heavelton, Pennsylvania.  
   
   
 == Early life ==  
 Dillman was born on September 14, 1882, the eldest of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. He came to Unitarianism at an early age and attended a local Unitarian church.  
   
   
 == Service ==  
 In 1893, Dillman graduated from Wesleyan University with an A.B. degree. He studied Bible and Jewish Studies at the University of Pennsylvania from 1893 to 1897, where he studied under Joseph Piaget. Dillman held his theological clerkship there from 1897 to 1903. Dillman was ordained a Wesleyan minister on October 25, 1903, and served as his secretary from 1901 to 1904.Dillman's love of the Unitarian church made him develop what is today called the Church Worship Movement. In 1905, he founded the Unitarian Church in West Philadelphia, which spread to mostly lower income areas in Philadelphia and surrounding areas. Dillman was soon transferred to the United Methodist Church in Untytown, where he became the church's Vice President and General Manager from 1910 to 1914. Dillman's commitment to his church inspired him to turn Unitarianism into a significant religion. He started to preach in Union Station and organized church meetings in Union Station. He served as Dean of the Graduate School from 1919 to 1924.  
   
   
 == Later life ==  
 In 1934, Dillman lost his religious beliefs, and decided to take up a job as an accountant. While doing clerical work for the United States Postal Service, Dillman met his future wife, Erma, in Philadelphia, and married her on April 10, 1938. The New York Times described Dillman's life as `` as giddy as any party in America. The young couple had been married only a few months, and he had never known her to sleep or eat. '' Her father, a wealthy businessman, considered the marriage premature because his demands `` ran counter to her taste and her health. '' Dillman was once back in his native Pennsylvania working at the Morgan Motor Works in Yorktown.  
 Dillman died in Heavelton on July 25, 1968, from pneumonia.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Dillman authored books on Baptismal History, Human Relations, Family Reunion, The Resurrection and Regeneration, and Orthodoxy. His book The Restoration of Christianity ( 1911 ) published two years before the Academy of Wesley published its Geschichte des Christentums Werke. Dillman contributed to denominational journals throughout his ministry, including Unitarian Review, New York Unitarian, and Unitarian Theological Review. Among his books were The Faith That Jesus Christ Revealed and What is A Christian God? ( 1914 ) and The Role of God in the Church.  
   
   
 == Death ==  
 In January 1935, he suffered a heart attack, which also took his lungs out and brain removed. He died in West Virginia.

George Cadogan Morgan ( 1754 - 17 November 1798 ) was a British dissenting minister and scientist .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born in 1754 at Bridgend , Glamorganshire , was the second son of William Morgan , a surgeon practising in that town , by Sarah , sister of Dr. Richard Price . William Morgan , the pioneer of actuarial science , was his elder brother . George was educated at Cowbridge grammar school and , for a time , at Jesus College , Oxford , whence he matriculated 10 October 1771.An intention of taking holy orders in the Church of England was abandoned , owing to the death of his father and the poverty of his family . His religious views also changed , and he soon became , under the guidance of his uncle , Richard Price , a student at the dissenting academy at Hoxton , where he remained for several years .   
 In 1776 , he settled as Unitarian minister at Norwich , where it is said that his advanced opinions exposed him to much annoyance from the clergy of the town . He was subsequently minister at Yarmouth for 1785-6 , but moved to Hackney early in 1787 , and became associated with Dr. Price in starting New College at Hackney , where he acted as tutor until 1791.In 1789 , accompanied by three friends , he set out on a tour through France , and his letters to his wife descriptive of the journey are still preserved . He was in Paris at the storming of the Bastille , and is supposed to have been the first to communicate the news to England . He sympathised with the revolution in its earlier stages , and held very optimistic views as to human progress , believing that the mind could be so developed as to receive , by intuition , knowledge which is now attainable only through research . In 1791 , following the death of Dr Price , he hoped for his position as preacher at the Gravel-pit meeting-house at Hackney , but , unsuccessful , he retired to Southgate , a village a few miles to the north . There he undertook the education of private pupils , and met with much success.Morgan gained a high reputation as a scientific writer , his best-known work being his Lectures on Electricity , which he had delivered to the students at Hackney . In these he foreshadowed several of the discoveries of subsequent scientific men . In chemistry , he was an advocate of the opinions of Stahl in opposition to those of Lavoisier , and was engaged upon a work on the subject at the time of his death.In 1785 , he communicated to the Royal Society a paper containing 'Observations and Experiments on the Light of Bodies in a state of Combustion ' . He was also the author of 'Directions for the use of a Scientific Table in the Collection and Application of Knowledge , . . . with a Life of the Author ' . This contains an elaborate table for the systematisation of all knowledge . He also made considerable progress in writing the memoirs of Dr. Richard Price.He died on 17 November 1798 of a fever contracted , it was supposed , while making a chemical experiment in which he inhaled some poison .   
    
    
 == Family ==   
 By his wife , Nancy Hurry of Yarmouth , he had seven sons and one daughter , Sarah , wife of Luke Ashburner of Bombay , who was a prominent figure in Bombay society .   
 Two of the sons , William Ashburner Morgan and Edward Morgan , successively became solicitors to the East India Company , while most of the others settled in America , where the eldest , Richard Price Morgan , was connected with railroad and other engineering works .

 Max Abbilder was born in Harz ; he was a cousin of the alchemist Aleksander Abbilder. He completed his habilitation in mathematics at the University of Berlin in 1928, studied abroad at Breslau and Cambridge, and became a naturalized citizen in 1932. His Habilitation dissertation was the `` De facto Operationia cognitus '' of Arno Moritz Heyrick, and the relationship between ideas and action : `` The relation between ideas and action depends upon a condition of imperfect causality ( identical ). ''  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Several of his fundamental works are published. The completeness theorem of Lie algebra was formalized in Abbilder's Habilitation dissertation. An important textbook of algebraic logic is Léon Steiner's Teil I-IV. From 1933 to 1941, his re-ordering theorem is a basis for Steiner's theory of finite groups. It has been described by Stephen Metcalfe as an `` immense breakthrough '' for working with finite groups, but is now largely ignored. With J. David Luce, E. P. Blyth, and Murray Papachristos, he was the first to formalize some notion of independence between algebraic operators. Also in 1933, he formalized the abstract countability of Lie algebras. He married Marie Berti and together they had three children, Wolfgang, Margit, and Pietro. In 1936, he founded and headed the Mathematical Institute of the University of Berne, which is now known as the Max Abbilder Institute of the Franck Universität Leopoldina. In 1947, the Institute of Linear Algebra was founded in Berlin to spread Max Abbilder's ideas. It is one of the world's leading centers of research in linear algebra.

Louis Arnauld de Candagno ( French : [ ɑlāʁn bə. ] ; 30 May 1742 – 14 March 1809 ) was a Belgian geographer.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Louis Arnauld de Candagno was born in Saint-François-de-Aube, in the Duchy of Deventer and graduated in 1777. He was physician to the Duke of Buccleuch, the general of the Hussite army, who was an opponent of the Huguenots and the Napoleonic Wars. During the French Revolution he was interned in a storehouse in Benoît-sur-Seine, but was permitted to return to Brussels in 1789.  
 He came to Brussels in 1796, in the employ of his father-in-law and Charles-Joseph Giraud ( 1711–1786 ). He was admitted as an Assistant Geographer in 1798. In the same year, he travelled to Russia as Deputy State Geographer in the Ottoman Empire.  
 In 1803 he was named Geographer to the Romanov government, which had assembled in Kiev in 1801.  
 Candagno published a work of monumental and historical character ( Histoire géographique des moscoms des Cordeliers de Jean-Baptiste Louis de Candagno ), which had eluded translation at that time, until Francoise Julien Bretter's edition was published in 1911. His contributions to the geography of France ( 1794–1805 ) and Britain ( 1805–1811 ) had opened up a new field in geographical research, the study of the global distribution of nations and their people. In this connection he was the first to find that the British Isles stood on the `` southern end '' of the distribution range of the British Isles.  
 The geographer Jean-Pierre Loïc Beaucaigne called him `` the father of geographers '', and thus the first of them. On the other hand, French academic historians Pierre-Sébastien Savard, Drouet Bursard, Franck Dufour, Florian Canton, and a small number of French officers considered him a great amateur who should be taken for a moron when elected to the Geographical Society of London.  
 Candagno appears to have wished to go to Switzerland to work for some partner or publisher of his large and important Histoire géographique. In 1802 he took his post in Palermo and at the time of his death in London in 1809, by then in great financial difficulties, he was still holding the post as a professor of geography at the Royal College of Physicians in London.

 = Dirk Hasselblad =  
Dirk Frits Hasselblad ( July 9, 1922 in Busingen – August 8, 1996 in Ramstein ) was a Dutch physicist. He was a co-discoverer of neutron scattering, and has earned the reputation of being a renowned leader of the field of quantum electronics, due to the Reionization of low-energy nuclear interactions using nuclear reactions and very low energy thermal currents. He was also a pioneer in Quantum Electrodynamics and related fields of quantum mechanical physics and devices for quantum mechanics.  
   
   
 == Life and career ==  
   
 Dirk Hasselblad was born on July 9, 1922 in Busingen. He had a brother who was also a physicist. He began his undergraduate studies at the Technische Hochschule Düsseldorf, after which he continued his medical studies at the University of Rostock, studying under Ludwig Boltzmann. He completed his doctorate in 1934, and was appointed an associate professor at the University of Giessen. During this time he began applying himself to research into photon optics, switching from nuclear to nuclear physics. He also performed pioneering work in quantum electrodynamics ( QED ).  
 In 1947, after working for ten years as a particle physicist, Hasselblad became a professor at the University of Marburg. In 1952 he was appointed professor of theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. In 1967 he was appointed director of the SPIE and technical services for the National Research Council. He also served as President of the Dutch Society of Physics in 1972.  
 In 1977, Hasselblad, along with Ole Johansen and Robert Waayck, established the Quantum Electrodynamics Research Group at the Institute for Quantum Optics ( SIMO ) in Eindhoven. With the support of architect Margarethe Oppenheim and Niels Bohr, the group developed the groundwork for the manufacture of quantum dot devices, creating the opportunity to develop new kinds of atomic transitions. Also in 1977, at the university's photonics center, the team developed a new type of glass crystal used in quantum dots, specifically for electron imaging, a specialised field in which the nature of ions induced the transitions to become possible. This work also furthered studies involving superposition and photoionization.  
 In 1992, Hasselblad was awarded the Ernest Weyl Prize.  
   
   
 == Personal life ==  
   
 Dirk Hasselblad married Zoë Kupermann in 1954. She was a physics lecturer in the University of Leiden, but his job gave him the right to buy her a house.

 = Henriette Alberti =  
Henriette Alberti ( 3 May 1870, France – 4 May 1940, Maine ) was an American physician and academic. She was the first woman to receive an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University and the first woman to receive a PhD from Brown University.  
   
   
 == Education and early career ==  
 Alberti was born Henriette Marie Chevreul in Paris, France, to Henriette Albert and Philippe Alberti.  
 Alberti went to the University of Paris in 1885 to receive her Ph.D.. in medicine, with her thesis being titled `` On the Prevention of Dry Oedema and Flushing ''. Alberti was the first woman to receive a degree in medicine in France at that time, and the first woman to receive a doctorate from a U.S. medical school. Alberti also received a BA and MA from the University of Paris.  
   
   
 == Career ==  
   
   
 === As a physician ===  
 Alberti worked at the Women's Hospital in Nantes, and was a surgeon in her hometown of Lyon.Alberti developed a passion for medicine after her son was killed in a car crash in 1888.In 1900, she moved to England, where she took a job as an assistant physician at Wakefield Hospital in Liverpool. She spent two years in the position, and moved to Ireland in 1902. There, she learned to practice medicine, and taught English at Queen's College, Belfast. She also held a post as a member of the surgical staff at Temple Mead Hospital in Derry.Alberti relocated to Montreal, Quebec, where she taught at University of Montreal from 1902 to 1904. In 1904, she married Dr. Harry Albert, who had taught anatomy at Yale University.Alberti was the first woman to earn an honorary doctorate in medicine. In 1905, she became a faculty member at Yale University, a position she held until her retirement in 1913.  
   
   
 === As a researcher ===  
 In 1916, Alberti went on a five-year observational study of nursing homes in the United States. While studying nurseries, she discovered the surprising practice of hiring only women as residents. Alberti was the first to question the prevailing belief in nursing as a male-dominated profession.She examined 167 nursing homes, searching for correlations between socioeconomic status and the state of health of its residents. She found a link between mortality rates and changes in access to health care, with a correlation between increases in hospital mortality and expenditures for their care.Alberti ran a study of hospitals in the U.S. from 1914 to 1917, comparing the health of the nursing population with that of the general population.While studying nursing homes in Montreal, she and her husband both developed a social interaction theory. They had just returned from a trip to an English-speaking country. Alberti did not recognize their happiness and resigned in 1918. She was described as modest in personality. The man she was married to continued to work and care for her as a supporting spouse.  
 Alberti received a fellowship from the Carnegie Institute in 1921 and received the lifetime appointment at Duke University in 1924, teaching until her death.Alberti died at her home in Clifton, Maine, aged 82, on 4 May 1940.  
   
   
 == Awards and honors ==  
 Alberti was an honorary doctoral candidate in her field from Brown University in 1915 and the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Duke University in 1921. In 1929, she received an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard University.  
   
   
 === Scientific legacy ===  
 In 1970, Alberti was recognized as the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate in medical science, and the first woman to receive a PhD from Brown University.

 = Axel Fischman =  
Axel Fischman ( 1 January 1755 – 20 November 1848 ) was a German naturalist, botanist, zoologist, archaeologist and writer. He contributed to numerous species of plants, especially fungi.  
   
   
 == Life ==  
 Fischman was born in Magdeburg to a Jewish family of artists. At the age of 15, he studied natural sciences, zoology and archaeology at the University of Erlangen.  
 He spent much time in France where he attended the museums of Paris and Versailles.After finishing his studies, he became an assistant to the botanist Friedrich Sittler at the Charles University of Berlin. As early as 1775 he made collections for Sittler and a list of thirty-nine species of plant species was submitted to him by Ferdinand August Blumenbach, a private collector. This list is today part of the Max Planck Botanical Garden.  
 While at Charles University in Berlin, Fischman founded the Society for the Protection of Natural History, which was the precursor of the Berlin Natural History Society, and then, after his return to Germany in 1783, the Botanical Garden.  
   
   
 == Works ==  
 Fischman's most significant work is a full-scale treatise on edible fungi ( 1787 ). In the process, he produced some of the first published descriptions of plants from the early Eocene era, including pansies, dwarf barks, dwarf rhizomes, and ovals. It is also notable for discovering Gyraceae ( a group of hybrid-plants ) and Phyllodendrone plants and for using the word stork as the generic name of all flowering plants.

Philip C. Hayden ( 1854–1925 ) was the primary force in organizing the Music Supervisors National Conference , later the Music Educators National Conference ( MENC ) . He was appointed the first supervisor of music in Quincy , Illinois in 1888 . In 1900 the administration decided that a capitol fund was necessary and eliminated the music supervisor position in the system . For this reason he moved to Keokuk , Iowa to take the position of music supervisor . Hayden founded The School Music Monthly in 1900 . In 1904 , it became the official publication of National Education Association 's Department of Music Education . The periodical was dedicated to a broad spectrum of issues dealing with public school music education . Hayden was editor of this publication for many years and was a frequent contributor .   
    
    
 == The Beginnings of the MSNC ==   
 The beginning of the MENC was an invitation by Hayden to come together in Keokuk and observe his work there . The invitation resulted from the cancellation of the 1906 meeting of the National Education Association because of the San Francisco earthquake . The second meeting of the new group was held in Indianapolis in 1909 , but a constitution was not adopted until 1910 in Cincinnati , where the group officially became the Music Supervisors National Conference . The appearance of the organization at a time when it could contribute to the expansion of American society in the second and third decades of the twentieth century was due to the foresight of P.C . Hayden .

John H. Tietjen ( June 18 , 1928 – February 15 , 2004 ) was a Lutheran clergyman , theologian , and national church leader in the United States . He is best known both for his role in the Seminex controversy which roiled the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod ( LCMS ) in the mid-1970s , and for his efforts on behalf of Lutheran unity that resulted in the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Tietjen was born in New York City as a son of German immigrants , and he attended Stuyvesant High School , Concordia Collegiate Institute ( now Concordia College , Bronxville ) , and Concordia Seminary in St. Louis , Missouri . He also earned master 's and doctorate degrees at Union Theological Seminary in New York . After being ordained in the LCMS in 1953 , Tietjen rose through the Synod ranks and eventually was chosen as president of its largest seminary , Concordia Seminary , in 1969 .   
 While president of Concordia Seminary , Tietjen and many of the Concordia faculty members faced opposition from a new , more conservative administration of the LCMS . The faculty 's use of Historical-Critical Method for biblical interpretation was cast by conservatives as being at odds with the historic theological position of the LCMS . Tietjen was accused of allowing the teaching of false doctrine , and he was suspended from his duties as seminary president in January 1974 .   
 As a result , Tietjen and the majority of the seminary faculty formed a rival seminary which they dubbed Concordia Seminary in Exile , or Seminex . Seminex existed in St. Louis until August 1983 , and on the campus of the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago ( LSTC ) until December 1987 . Meanwhile , Tietjen and many of his supporters left the LCMS to form the more liberal Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches ( AELC ) . During the early 1980s , Tietjen and the AELC organized unity talks among several other Lutheran church bodies , eventually leading to the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) , which today is the largest Lutheran church body in the United States .

The Portrait of Ugolino Martelli is a painting by the Italian artist Agnolo di Cosimo , known as Bronzino , executed in 1536 or 1537 . It is housed in the Gemäldegalerie , Berlin , Germany . The work is signed BRONZO FIORENTINO on the edge of the table top.Ugolino Martelli ( 1519-1592 ) was a Florentine aristocrat , a humanist and a linguist , whose palace can be seen in the background of the picture . A marble David of the family 's collection appears in the background . It was attributed at the time to Donatello , while it is now ascribed to Antonio or Bernardo Rossellino and dated between about 1461 to 1479 . The earliest reference to the sculpture is in the private records of Luigi d'Ugolino Martelli ( Ugolino 's grandfather ) , in an inventory of his possessions begun in 1488 . It is now in the National Gallery in Washington D.C . The David was a traditional symbol of the Florentine freedom , and could be an allusion to Martelli adherence to the city 's Republican party.On the scholar 's worktable a copy of Homer 's Iliad , in Greek , can be seen turned towards the reader . It is open at the beginning of the ninth book , the Embassy to Achilles . A second book , of which only a corner is visible , is inscribed MARO , indicating the Latin poet Publius Vergilius Maro better known as Virgil . Ugolino 's left arm is supported by a work by Pietro Bembo , whose sonnets were written in the vernacular . Ugolino lectured on Bembo and had met him by 1539 .   
    
 Another portrait of Ugolino Martelli is housed in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C . It was attributed to Pontormo , and is now believed to be by a closely associated painter .

He received early musical education on the cello from his father before going to university in Vienna to study law . He soon obtained a position in the Imperial Hofkapelle . In 1778 he was appointed cellist in Prince Nikolaus Esterházy 's orchestra , where he met and studied composition with Haydn . After Esterházy died in 1790 , he went to Vienna and became a founding member of the Schuppanzigh Quartet , where he helped establish the traditions of string quartet playing . He played in the Grassalkovich court and from 1796 was employed in the orchestra of Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz . He died on 28 August 1820 in Vienna .   
 Kraft was considered one of the greatest cellists of his time and both Haydn 's Cello Concerto No . 2 in D and the cello part in Beethoven 's Triple Concerto were written for him , though his son Nikolaus Kraft is also claimed to have played the premiere of the latter .   
 As a composer , he wrote cello sonatas ( six for cello with bass published as Op . 1 and 2 ) and a cello concerto ( Op . 4 ) . He also wrote various duos : for violin and cello ( Op . 3 ) , for cello and double bass and for two cellos ( Op . 5 and 6 ) .

Boris Jergerovich Ekimov ( Russian : Гергий Александрович Факрандов ) ( 19 October 1862 – 18 August 1953 ) was a Soviet zoologist. He was president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR from 1921 to 1927 and from 1930 to 1943. He was also a member of the V.I. Lenin Botanical Expedition in Siberia.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Boris Jergerovich Ekimov was born in Red-Donets. His father, a prominent merchant, died when he was six years old. Ekimov attended the State Conservatory in Moscow and graduated from Moscow State University in 1881. While studying at the University of Dorpat he became convinced that evolution could be explained by Natural Selection. For Ekimov, such `` biological competition '' – natural selection – for various individuals within an organism was not the most natural means of evolution. From 1887 he taught biology at the Leningrad State University. He later received the doctoral degree in 1886 and was granted teaching positions in Moscow University, Imperial University of Odessa and Moscow State University.  
   
   
 == Academic career ==  
 During his time at Odessa, Ekimov published a series of books, mostly on physiology and zoology. He was member of the National Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He served as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 1902 to 1906 and the First Secretariat of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1906 to 1906. He was involved in the outbreak of the Second Balkan War of 1905. He also became the president of the Association for the Study of the Phylloxera and Phytozoa ( Astrophysics ) in 1910.  
 Ekimov had his doctoral dissertation on Drosophila venom glands and his more famous textbook on parasitology. As well as teaching, he was a member of the first Congress of scientific societies of the USSR, held in Berlin in 1912.Ekimov's main work on evolution is Anatomy and Physiology of Birds and Turtles ( 1932 ). The last book published by him was published in 1942. His topic was `` Contribution of Animals to the History of Life. ''

 = Heinrich Barkhausen =   
Heinrich Georg Barkhausen ( 2 December 1881 – 20 February 1956 ) , born in Bremen , was a German physicist.Growing in a patrician Bremen family , he showed interest in natural sciences from an early age . He studied at the Technical University of Munich ( 1901 ) , TU Berlin ( 1902 ) and University of Munich ( 1903 ) and Berlin before obtaining a doctorate at the University of Göttingen in 1907.He became professor of electrical engineering at the Technische Hochschule Dresden in 1911 at the age of 29 , thus obtaining the world 's first chair in this discipline .   
 In 1919 , he discovered the Barkhausen effect ( named after him ) , which provided evidence for the magnetic domain theory of ferromagnetism . When the magnetic field through a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is changing , the magnetization of the material changes in a series of tiny discontinuous jumps , which can be heard as a series of clicks in a loudspeaker attached to a coil of wire around the iron . It was later determined that these jumps were caused by the movement of the magnetic domains in the iron , as the domain walls snap past defects in the crystal lattice . The energy lost in these dissipative events is responsible for the shape of the hysteresis curve of iron and other ferromagnets . This effect is widely used in research , and physics education as a simple experiment to demonstrate the reality of magnetic domains .   
 In 1920 , he invented the Barkhausen-Kurz oscillator , with K. Kurz , the first vacuum tube electronic oscillator to use electron transit-time effects . It was the first vacuum tube oscillator that could operate at ultrahigh frequency , up to 300 MHz , and inspired later microwave transit-time tubes such as the klystron.In 1921 he derived the first mathematical conditions for oscillation in electrical circuits , now called the Barkhausen stability criterion . They are widely used today in the design of electronic oscillators and general feedback amplifier circuits .   
 In 1933 Barkhausen signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State .

Rudolf Sieverts ( 3 November 1903 – 28 April 1980 ) was a German Law professor and Criminologist .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Rudolf Sieverts was born in Meißen , a short distance down river from Dresden . His father , Adolf Ferdinand Sieverts , was a Chemistry professor.He studied Jurisprudence at Greifswald , Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg , acquiring his doctorate of law along the way . It was at Hamburg that he studied successfully for his habilitation ( higher academic qualification ) while working as a research assistant for   
 Moritz Liepmann . The work was supervised by Ernst Delaquis . Sieverts received his habilitation in 1932 , and two years later Ernst Delaquis was forced to resign from his academic posts at Hamburg . Delaquis was Jewish . Delaquis went on to pursue his career , successfully , in Switzerland . In Hamburg , Sieverts took over the professorship , holding between 1934 and his own retirement in 1971 the teaching chair for criminal law , criminology , youth law , forensic law and comparative law . Some of his more notable students over the years included Harro Otto and Hans-Dieter Schwind ( whose doctorates he supervised ) , Horst Schüler-Springorum , Herbert Jäger and Hans Joachim Schneider ( whose habilitations he supervised ) and Anne-Eva Brauneck.During the middle 1930s he also worked for the German Academic Exchange Service ( `` Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst '' / DAAD ) , taking a leadership position with the DAAD London branch office in 1935/36 . Visiting England , he took a particular interest in the education provision for youth offenders and in the borstal system , an area in which at that time the British system was seen as a standard setter . He had already concluded , while still a student , that most criminals had already embarked on their criminal careers while still children or teenagers.Since taking power at the start of 1933 the Nazi government had rapidly transformed Germany into a one-party state . In 1937 Sieverts applied for Nazi Party membership : his application was accepted in March 1940 . He served on the senate ( governing council ) of the Nazis ' Tropical Medicines Academy ( `` Kolonialärztliche Akademie der NSDAP '' ) . In October 1944 he also accepted a position involving the Hitler Youth . Sources are imprecise on the details and extent of Sieverts ' involvement with the Nazi regime , but he was briefly interned after the war at the Neuengamme internment camp established in the British occupation zone to hold people suspected of involvement in Nazi crimes in the Hamburg area : he was released only in 1946.Later on Sieverts was a member of the expert committee on youth justice which had a decisive influence over the 1953 reform of the Juvenile Courts Act . In October 1953 he was appointed senior chair of the Youth Court in Munich . He was temporarily president of the regional High Court in Hamburg , and in 1960 he chaired the Working Group on Criminal Law reform . He spoke out in 1964 against a general amnesty for political crimes of the Third Reich era . In 1967 he was appointed to chair the West German Justice Ministry 's Federal Justice commission.Between 1961 and 1963 Sieverts served as Rector at the University of Hamburg . Between 1964 and 1967 he was president of the West German University Rectors ' Conference . In 1964 he was a co-founder in Hamburg of the first West German Amnesty International group .

 Houstoun was born in Houston , Renfrewshire . He began a degree course in medicine at St Andrew 's University but interrupted his studies to visit the West Indies , returning circa 1727 . On 6 October 1727 , he entered the University of Leyden to continue his studies under Boerhaave , graduating M.D . in 1729 . It was during his time at Leyden that Houstoun became interested in the medicinal properties of plants . After returning to England that year , he soon sailed for the Caribbean and the Americas employed as a ship 's surgeon for the South Sea Company . He collected plants in Jamaica , Cuba , Venezuela , and Vera Cruz , despatching seeds and plants to Philip Miller , head gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden in London . Notable among these plants was Dorstenia contrayerva , a reputed cure for snake-bite , and Buddleja americana , the latter named by Linnaeus , at Houstoun 's request , for the English cleric and botanist Adam Buddle , although Buddle could have known nothing of the plant as he had died in 1715 . [ 1 ] Houstoun published accounts of his studies in Catalogus plantarum horti regii Parisiensis .   
 When Houstoun returned to London in 1731 , he was introduced to Sir Hans Sloane by Miller . Sloane commissioned him to undertake a three-year expedition , financed by the trustees for the Province of Georgia 'for improving botany and agriculture in Georgia ' , and to help stock the Trustee 's Garden planned for Savannah . Houstoun initially sailed to the Madeira Islands to gather grape plantings before continuing his voyage across the Atlantic . However he never completed his mission as he 'died from the heat ' on 14 August 1733 soon after arriving in Jamaica ; he was buried at Kingston . Houstoun was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1733 .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Houstoun 's writings and plant specimens , now preserved in the botanical department of the British Museum , passed from Miller to Sir Joseph Banks , by whom the manuscripts were published as Reliquiae Houstounianae in 1781 .

 = Jacques Creer =  
Jacques Creer ( 24 November 1845 – 26 April 1912 ) was a French entomologist who specialised in insects, especially the mosquitoes.  
   
   
 == Biography ==  
 Jacques Creer was born at Carcassonne. He began his career as an assistant and later a chief gardener, and devoted himself mainly to the study of mosquitoes. As a result, in 1875 he wrote an article on subspecies of ant, Liolaemus crescorum, of South Africa. In 1886 he became a junior entomologist. In 1891 he published the results of an investigation, undertaken in conjunction with his colleague, Dr. Van Schryver, and in the course of which the three of them collected in the Hausend – Sur-Vincent region of Southern Africa an abundance of mosquitoes. The articles, collected during the years 1894–1895, became a regular appendix in The Entomologist, and were occasionally reproduced in local journals.Upon his return to France in 1897 he started work on an introduction to zoology which appeared in four parts in 1902, and another in 1905. In 1905 he was the author of a lengthy article on Liolaemus ( Liolaemus crescorum ), which appeared in the Gazette de la Société d'Etude géographique, and in 1908 in the Bulletin des Minéralogie, ou, Mémoire sur la Société Géologique des Animaux, and in 1910, together with other authors, the volume on Liolaemus ( Liolaemus crescorum ) which appeared in the Journal des Sciences Naturelles, and also in the Bulletin d'Entomologie Universelle.  
   
   
 == Research ==  
   
 Creer developed a theory of the inheritance of character which at one time was accepted by the majority of researchers in entomology. This idea was that a person becomes chaste ( mère chaleur ) when he or she is exposed to the intensity of the mosquito-borne disease, regardless of any hormonal or other factors affecting the body. However, in 1910, Creer and his colleagues presented, at the 60th International Congress on Parasites, the case of a hunter, surnamed Creer ( Norwegian : Cresco ), who was reported to have had a lifelong relationship with a parrot female, Romée Jean Melchior, after her death from cholera. They ruled out that jealousy was at work and concluded that Creer was simply being `` hard on '' her. This later became known as the Creer case. However, the veracity of this case was questioned, and, in fact, the material that resulted from this investigation did not support Creer's hypothesis of the origin of character ; instead, it pointed to local personal relationships to be the factor in character formation.Of note, Creer also conducted an investigation which involved observations in a part of North Africa, in partnership with Eugène Royer, and which led to the establishment of two families ( Malipenes ) in Asia and South America.  
 His most important scientific contribution was the development of a theory of the transmission of tsetse flies to other insects, which eventually led to the research of tropical diseases, particularly dengue fever.Creer was an apothecary.
