 = Ludwig Borchardt =   
Ludwig Borchardt ( October 5 , 1863 – August 12 , 1938 ) was a German Egyptologist who was born in Berlin . He is best known for finding a famous bust of Nefertiti at Amarna .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
 Also known as Herbert , Borchardt initially studied Architecture and later Egyptology under Adolf Erman . In 1895 he journeyed to Cairo and produced , with Gaston Maspero , the Catalogue of the Egyptian Museum ( Catalogue Général du Musée du Caire ) .His main focus was Ancient Egyptian architecture . He began excavations in Amarna , where he discovered the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose . Amongst its contents was the famous bust of Nefertiti , ( now in the Neues Museum in Berlin ) . From 1902 until 1908 , he undertook extensive excavations of the Pyramid of Sahure , exploring the entire mortuary complex . He published his discoveries in a two-volume study Das Grabdenkmal des Konigs Sahure , `` The Funerary Monument of the King Sahure '' , which is still considered the standard work on Sahure 's complex.Borchardt married Emilie ( Mimi ) Cohen , one of the daughters of Eduard Cohen and Ida Kuhn . In 1903 , Mimi received an inheritance from her grandfather Abraham Kuhn of 150,000 Marks , a considerable fortune equal to 53.7 kilograms of gold , and spent most of it on buying a villa in Cairo.In 1907 Borchardt founded the German Archaeological Institute ( Deutsches Archäologische Institut ) in Cairo , and remained its director until 1928 . While based in Cairo , he also directed the excavations in Heliopolis and the noble tombs of the Old Kingdom in Abu Gorab . He died in Zürich on August 12 , 1938 .   
 Recently , controversy has arisen with the assertion that Borchardt smuggled the bust of Nefertiti out of Egypt by reporting it as an artifact made of gypsum . However , the Swiss art historian Henri Stierlin has claimed that the bust is a copy dating from 1912 .

 = John Barclay (anatomist) =   
John Barclay ( 10 December 1758 – 21 August 1826 ) was an eminent Scottish comparative anatomist , extramural teacher in anatomy , and director of the Highland Society of Scotland .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born in Cairn , Perthshire 10 December 1758 , the son of a farmer , and nephew of John Barclay , who established the Berean Church .   
 He was educated at Muthill parish school .   
 Barclay initially studied divinity at the University of St Andrews , and served as a minister . Then working as a family tutor , he educated himself in biological topics and anatomy . Pupils of his entered the University of Edinburgh in 1789 , and Barclay became an assistant there to John Bell the anatomist , and was also associated with his brother Charles Bell . His employer Sir James Campbell financed the completion of his medical course.Barclay qualified M.D . at Edinburgh , before studying anatomy under Andrew Marshall for a year in London . He returned to Edinburgh and established himself as an anatomical lecturer in 1797 . Until 1825 he delivered two complete courses of human anatomy , a morning and an evening one , every winter session , and for several years before his death gave a summer course on comparative anatomy . His classes gradually grew in reputation ; in 1804 he was formally recognised as a lecturer on anatomy and surgery by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons , and in 1806 he became a fellow of the Edinburgh College of Physicians.When a new chair of comparative anatomy for the University of Edinburgh was proposed in 1816 , Barclay was the leading candidate . However , the proposal was defeated by the concerted opposition of a number of the incumbent medical professors , led by John Hope , Robert Jameson and Alexander Monro , tertius , who feared the new chair would encroach on their own prerogatives . This episode provided the subject of a memorable caricature by John Kay .   
    
 Barclay supported his former pupil William Dick when he established his Dick Veterinary School .   
 For the final two years of his life Barclay was too ill to teach , during which his classes were carried on by Robert Knox , another former pupil.He died at Argyll Square in Edinburgh on 21 August 1826 , and was buried in Restalrig Churchyard on the east side of the city .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Barclay contributed the article Physiology to the third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica ( 1797 ) . He developed ideas for a nomenclature of human anatomy based on scientific principles in A New Anatomical Nomenclature ( 1803 ) . In 1808 he published a treatise on The Muscular Motions of the Human Body , arranged according to regions and systems , and with applications to surgery . This was followed in 1812 by his Description of the Arteries of the Human Body , the result of original study and dissection . A second edition appeared in 1820.He furnished descriptive matter to a series of plates illustrating the human skeleton and the skeletons of some animals , engraved by Edward Mitchell of Edinburgh in 1819–20 . Several of his lectures on anatomy were published posthumously in 1827 . Another work was An Inquiry into the Opinions , Ancient and Modern , concerning Life and Organisation , published in 1822 . In this work Barclay gives a spirited defense of vitalism against a catalogue of thinkers he considered to be advocates of materialistic theories of life , including Erasmus Darwin , William Lawrence and Jean-Baptiste Fray . [ 1 ] The noted Scottish zoologist and geologist John Fleming wrote that Concerning Life and Organization `` should be perused with care by every student of Anatomy and Natural History , as an effective preservative against the doctrines of Materialism '' .He wrote Remarks on Mr. John Bell 's Anatomy of the heart & arteries under the name `` Jonathan Dawplucker , Esq . ''   
    
    
 == Family ==   
 Barclay married Eleanora , daughter of his former employer Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill , in 1811 .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Barclay gave his large collection of specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1821 , under the condition that a suitable hall be built to display all the materials together , associated with his name . In 1828 his collection became the Barcleian Museum . It can now be seen at Surgeons ' Hall .

 = Jacob Whitman Bailey =   
Jacob Whitman Bailey ( 1811–1857 ) was an American naturalist , known as the pioneer in microscopic research in America.He was born in Auburn , Mass. , and in 1832 graduated at West Point , where , after 1834 , he was successively assistant professor , acting professor , and professor of chemistry , mineralogy , and geology . At West Point he studied with John Torrey . He devised various improvements in the construction of the microscope and made an extensive collection of microscopic objects and of algæ , which he left to the Boston Society of Natural History . In 1857 he was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , as well as a member of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science , a precursor to the Smithsonian Institution . He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( AAAS ) in 1845 . Bailey and his son William were survivors of the steamboat Henry Clay disaster on July 28 , 1852 , though his wife and daughter , both named Maria , were among the casualties .   
 Bailey died on February 26 , 1857 , at the beginning of his term of office as President of the AAAS . On August 19 , 1857 , Augustus Addison Gould delivered a speech to the AAAS in commemoration of Bailey 's life . The speech was subsequently published in the American Journal of Science and Arts , volume xxv ( second series ) , ( New Haven , May 1858 ) .He wrote many articles on scientific subjects for the American Journal of Science and for scientific societies , a report on the infusorial fossils of California , and a valuable volume of Microscopical Sketches , containing 3000 original figures .   
 The genus Baileya , a North American genus of sun-loving wildflowers native to the deserts of northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States was named by botanists William Henry Harvey and Asa Gray in honor of their colleague Jacob Whitman Bailey .   
 It was Jacob Whitman Bailey that Lieut . Matthew Fontaine Maury wrote a letter to inquiring as to the material from the sea floor brought up with Lt. John Mercer Brook 's deep-sea soundings and core samples . From that it was determined that the sea floor where the trans-Atlantic Cable was laid because the samples showed Lieut . M F Maury that his `` Telegraphic Plateau '' was perfect for the underwater cable . The samples Maury sent proved the `` Telegraphic Plateau '' samples were non-abrasive for such a cable to be laid .

 = Friedrich Wilhelm Klatt =   
Friedrich Wilhelm Klatt ( 13 February 1825 Hamburg – 3 March 1897 Hamburg ) was a German botanist who specialised in the study of African plants .   
 As a child he showed artistic talent , but for financial reasons , training and a career in art could not be followed . In 1854 he and his brother took over the running of a boys ' school in Hamburg . He taught there until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War after which he taught natural science at several schools in Hamburg .   
 His first botanical collections were made in and about Hamburg as well as on the North Sea coastline . Through his collecting he became acquainted with Professor Lehmann of the Hamburg Botanical Gardens , who invited Klatt to organise and run his herbarium . Lehmann acted as mentor to Klatt , who soon concentrated his attention on the botanical families of Iridaceae and Pittosporaceae . His subsequent revision of the Iridaceae `` Revisio Iridearum '' led to his being awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Rostock and an offer of a professorship which he declined .   
 Klatt contributed sections on Iridaceae to several publications — `` Conspectus Florae Africae '' by Durand & Schinz , `` Flora Brasiliensis '' by Martius , `` Symbolæ ad Floram Brasiliæ centralis cognoscendam '' by Eugenius Warming and `` Baron Carl Claus von der Deckens reisen in Ost-Afrika in den jahren 1859 bis 1865 '' ( `` Karl Klaus von der Decken 's travels in East Africa in 1859–65 '' ) . Klatt 's greatest interest though , lay with the Compositae , and his publications on this family covered German East Africa , Madagascar , Australia , Brazil , Guatemala , Colombia and Costa Rica . He corresponded with and visited Kew , exchanged specimens with Asa Gray and managed to build up a considerable personal collection . In addition to his collection , he made detailed drawings of a large number of the specimens , especially type specimens , that were sent to him for identification . In 1877 John Gilbert Baker named the genus Klattia ( family Iridaceae ) in his honor.After Klatt 's death , his herbarium specimens were bought by and donated to the Gray Herbarium and the Botanical Institute of the University of Hamburg . This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Klatt when citing a botanical name .

 == Life ==   
 He was born at Valognes , and died in Paris .   
 His father , Edmond Pelouze , was an industrial chemist and the author of several technical handbooks . The son , after spending some time in a pharmacy at La Fère acted as laboratory assistant to Gay-Lussac and Jean Louis Lassaigne at Paris from 1827 to 1829 . In 1830 he was appointed associate professor of chemistry at Lille , but returning to Paris next year became repetiteur , and subsequently professor at the École polytechnique . He also held the chair of chemistry at the Collège de France , and in 1833 became assayer to the mint and in 1848 president of the Commission des Monnaies . He resigned all his public positions in 1852.After the coup d'état in 1851 he resigned his appointments , but continued to conduct an experimental laboratory-school he had started in 1846 . There he worked with the explosive material guncotton and other nitrosulphates . His student Ascanio Sobrero was the discoverer of nitroglycerin ( 1847 ) , and another student , Alfred Nobel , was to take that discovery on to great heights in the form of commercial explosives including dynamite . He was a major inspiration for both students .   
 Though Pelouze made no discovery of outstanding importance , he was a busy investigator , his work including researches on salicin , on beetroot sugar , on various organic acids ( gallic , malic , tartaric , butyric , lactic , etc . ) , on oenanthic ether ( with Liebig ) , on the nitrosulphates , on guncotton , and on the composition and manufacture of glass .   
 He also carried out determinations of the atomic weights of several elements , and with E. Fremy , published Traité de chimie générale ( 1847–1850 ) ; Abrégé de chimie ( 1848 ) ; and Notions générales de chimie ( 1853 ) .   
 His son Eugène-Philippe Pelouze married Marguerite Wilson , a rich heiress , in 1857 . The couple purchased the Château de Chenonceau in 1864 . Marguerite continued to live there until 1888 , when she ran out of money and was forced to sell.His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower .

 = Henri Cohen (composer) =   
Henri Cohen ( Amsterdam , 21 April 1806 – Paris , 17 May 1880 ) was a French music theorist , composer , and numismatist of Dutch birth .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Born in Amsterdam , Cohen moved with his family to Paris at a young age . He studied in Paris with Anton Reicha ( music theory and composition ) , François Lays ( singing ) , and Felice Pellegrini ( singing ) .   
    
    
 == Music ==   
 In 1832-34 and 1838-1839 he was active as an opera composer in Naples , with some of his works premiering under the name Carlo Coen . In 1841 his opera Antonio Foscarini premiered successfully at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna , prompting a revival the following year at the Teatro Regio di Torino . He was thereafter active as music teacher in Paris , including teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris , and was for a time director of the conservatory in Lille .   
 Cohen wrote several compositions , one of which , the opera `` l'Impératrice '' , was performed , about 1834 , in Naples , Paris , and London . Moreover , he published four tracts about musical theory .

 He published several works during his lifetime . Cohen 's Guide de l'amateur des livres à vignettes du XVIII Siècle went through four editions and is considered the standard bibliography of French 18th century illustrated books . He is perhaps best known for his two fundamental works on ancient numismatics : the first , published in 1854 , dealt with the Roman Republican coinage , while the second , issued in 8 volumes from 1859 to 1868 , focused on the coinage of the Roman Empire , from Pompey to Romulus Augustus ( 49 BC - 476 ) . Cohen was also curator of the numismatics collection at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris .

Alexander Hollaender ( 9 December 1898 – 6 December 1986 ) was one of the world 's leading researchers in radiation biology and in genetic mutations . In 1983 he was given the Enrico Fermi Award by the United States Department of Energy for his contributions in founding the science of radiation biology , and for his leadership in promoting `` scientific exchanges '' between American scientists and scientists from developing countries.Hollaender was born in Samter , German Empire ( Szamotuły , Poland ) , he emigrated to the US in 1921 .   
 In 1939 Hollaender published research showing that the mutations of spores of the ringworm fungus occurred in the same spectrum as the absorption spectrum of nucleic acids indicating that nucleic acids form the building blocks of genes . A young Esther M. Zimmer , who worked with Dr. Hollaender at the U. S. Public Health Service ( Bethesda , MD ) , published with Dr. Hollaender and Milislav Demerec in this very early field of x-ray- and UV-induced mutations . Later on , Esther M. Zimmer ( now Esther Lederberg ) became one of the most influential founders of bacterial and bacteriophage ( Lambda ) genetics . Later on , Hollaender worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratories with M. Laurance Morse , who himself later went on to collaborate with Esther Lederberg .   
 His research was not appreciated for its discovery at the time , and later scientists reports were necessary before science accepted the role of nucleic acids as the genetic material . Historians of science now realize his early discovery , and his Fermi Award recognized this discovery.In 1981 Hollaender established the Council for Research Planning in Biological Sciences , and was its president at the time of his death from a pulmonary embolism in 1986 . The US National Academy of Sciences gives the Alexander Hollaender Award in Biophysics every three years in his honor .

Franco Andrea Bonelli ( 10 November 1784 – 18 November 1830 ) was an Italian ornithologist , entomologist and collector .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Very little is known about the early life of Bonelli : he was born in Cuneo and was interested from an early age in the fauna which surrounded him , making collecting trips , preparing specimens and noting his observations .   
 He became a member of the Reale Società Agraria di Torino in 1807 when he presented his first studies relating to the Coleoptera of Piedmont . The high quality of these studies attracted the interest of the naturalists of his time .   
 In April 1810 , George Vat was sent to Turin by the French government to reorganize the University of Turin and begin its fusion with the Impériale University founded by Napoleon . Vat was very impressed by Bonelli 's knowledge . Vat encouraged him to further his knowledge by coming to follow courses at the Natural History Museum in Paris .   
    
 Bonelli took this advice so as obtain a professor 's chair in the new university . In September 1810 , he arrived in Paris .   
 In 1811 , Bonelli was finally named professor of zoology at the University of Turin and keeper of the natural history museum of zoology . During his time at the university , he formed one of the largest ornithological collections in Europe .   
 In 1811 , Bonelli wrote a Catalogue of the Birds of Piedmont , in which he described 262 species . In 1815 , he discovered the bird Bonelli 's warbler ( Phylloscopus bonelli ) , named by Louis Vieillot in 1819 . In the same year , he discovered Bonelli 's eagle ( Hieraaetus fasciatus ) that was likewise named by Vieillot in 1822 .   
 The successor of Bonelli at the Turin Museum was Carlo Giuseppe Gené .   
    
    
 == Achievements ==   
 Bonelli is most notable for his work on birds and on the beetle family Carabidae . Since he was an early worker on Coleoptera many of his genera later became Families , sub families and tribes . Also many of his genera survive .

 = James Six =   
James Six FRS ( 1731 – 25 August 1793 ) was a British scientist born in Canterbury . He is noted for his invention , in 1780 , of Six 's thermometer , commonly known as the maximum- minimum thermometer . This device is still in common use today and widely sold in garden centres .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Six was from a family of refugees from the Continent who had settled in England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , and who had worked as silk weavers for generations . James Six himself had trained in the family business , but by his time this was in decline because of cheap imported silks from India and Persia .   
 He became interested in natural philosophy , and devoted himself to astronomy and meteorology . In 1782 The Royal Society of London published an account of the thermometer that Six had invented two years earlier . He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1792 , his election was the result of this and other papers he had published on meteorology .   
 In 1783 he performed a number of thermometrical measurements on Canterbury cathedral in conjunction with Sir John Cullum , who wrote about them for Philosophical Transactions in “ Account of extraordinary Frost , 23 June 1783 ” , ( Philosophical Transactions , lxxiv ( 1784 ) ) .   
 Six wrote about his invention in his book , The Construction and Use of a Thermometer for Showing the Extremes of Temperature in the Atmosphere , during the Observer 's Absence , together with Experiments and Variations of Local Heat ; and other Meteorological Observations . This was published posthumously in London , in 1794 , a year after he died .   
 James Six died on 25 August 1793 at the age of sixty-two . His wife Mary died on 19 March 1801 and they are buried together in a vault in Westgate Church , Canterbury .

Princess Stéphanie of Windisch-Graetz ( April 4 , 1909 in Ploskovice , Bohemia – May 29 , 2005 in Uccle , Belgium ) was the daughter of Prince Otto Weriand of Windisch-Graetz ( 1873–1952 ) and Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria ( 1883–1963 ) , only child of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and Princess Stéphanie of Belgium . She was the great-grandchild of Emperor Franz-Joseph and Empress Elisabeth ( 'Sissi ' ) of Austria . She was also the great-grandchild of King Leopold II of Belgium .   
 Her full name was Stéphanie Eleonore Maria Elisabeth Kamilla Philomena Veronika zu Windisch-Grätz in German , and Stéphanie Éléonore Marie Élisabeth Camille Philomène Véronique de Windisch-Grätz in French . She may have been named after her maternal grandmother , Princess Stéphanie of Belgium . Her nickname in the family was Fée .   
    
    
 == Parents ' separation , effect on life ==   
 As a child she suffered greatly from her mother 's frequent absences , and her parents ' inharmonious marriage . The couple was separated in 1924 and divorced in 1948 . Her mother came to live in Brussels with the four children and Princess Clementine of Belgium offered a friendly refuge to Stéphanie .   
 In 1921 , Archduchess Elisabeth had begun a relationship with the Austrian socialist member of parliament Leopold Petznek , whom she eventually married in 1948 . Stéphanie got along well with her stepfather , but her relationship with her mother was not very good , and worsened after her second marriage . Archduchess Elisabeth did not like Karl-Axel Björklunderd , and forbade him her house . Stéphanie financially supported her father Otto Weriand in later life .   
 Stéphanie had three elder brothers :   
    
 Prince Franz Joseph zu Windisch-Grätz ( 1904 in Prague - 1981 in Nairobi ) , married to Ghislaine d'Arschot Schoonhoven ( 1912–1997 ) and father of   
 Princess Stéphanie Windisch-Graetz ( 1939-2019 ) became an artist , known for her photographic portraits using only candles as a source of light and for her sensual images from the animal world . She married Dermot Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell ( 1935–2009 ) ( a descendant of Nicholas Blundell ) . They are the parents of :   
 Henry Victor William Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell ( born 1967 ) and   
 Alexander Otto Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell ( born 1969 ) , whose surname was changed to `` de Windisch-Graetz '' in Belgium in 2011 .   
 Prince Guillaume Franz Josef Maria Windisch-Graetz ( born 1950 ; unmarried ) .

 = Frederick Walker Mott =   
Sir Frederick Walker Mott ( 23 October 1853 in Brighton , Sussex – 8 June 1926 in Birmingham , Warwickshire ) was one of the pioneers of biochemistry in Britain . He is noted for his work in neuropathology and endocrine glands in relation to mental disorder , and consequently as psychiatrist and social scientist . He was Croonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians for the year 1900.The Maudsley Hospital in London was Mott 's idea , inspired by Emil Kraepelin 's clinic in Germany , and Mott conducted the negotiations for its funding and construction . He ran the pathology laboratory which was transferred there , and treated shell shock patients during World War I . His reputation had been greatly enhanced by helping establish that 'general paralysis of the insane ' was actually due to syphilis , but he has been criticised for overly organic and degenerative assumptions in regard to mental illness including shell shock . After the war , in a lecture to the Eugenics Education Society , he claimed that shell shock was rare in volunteers as opposed to regular conscripted men , and that it was not a new disorder but merely a variation occurring in those already predisposed.Mott , like Maudsley , appears to have held that mental illness was inherited due to degenerate family lines that worsened until dying out , though his selecting of cases and statistics were questioned by other eugenicists . Mott advanced an overarching theory that mental disease was due to pathology of the sexual reproductive system , as evidenced for example by atrophied testes , causing breakdown of cerebral neurons in certain parts of the brain .

 = William J. Oswald =   
William Joseph Oswald ( July 6 , 1919 – December 8 , 2005 ) was an American educator , scientist , and engineer who spent his entire academic career at the University of California , Berkeley in the departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Public Health . He made foundational contributions to the fields of wastewater treatment and applied phycology , or as he called it , `` algology '' . Throughout a career spanning more than five decades , Oswald was the primary academic advisor to more than two dozen doctoral students , sat on more than 100 additional masters and doctoral thesis committees , and taught seminal courses in applied algology .   
    
    
 == Early life , military service , and education ==   
 Oswald was born in King City , California in 1919 . He grew up on a ranch in that area , where the arid climate stoked his interest in water supplies , wastewater treatment , and water use . In World War II , he served in the Army Air Forces and was responsible for water safety at one of the D-Day invasion camps . Oswald remained in the Army in Europe after the war , working in a hospital where he cared for patients suffering from waterborne ailments and met his lifelong wife , an American nurse . Returning home to California , he obtained a degree in civil engineering from the University of California , Berkeley in 1950 on the G.I . Bill . He then continued his studies and was awarded an M.S . ( 1951 ) and Ph.D. ( 1957 ) in sanitary engineering , biology and public health . Oswald joined the faculty of the university the same year and went on to become a full professor in 1970 . He remained in the position his entire career , staying on as an emeritus professor after his retirement .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Oswald studied the role of algae in wastewater treatment as a student , winning recognition from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his early work . He continued investigating the use of microalgae in sanitation throughout his career , developing strategies for combining engineered algae ponds to obtain specific water treatment goals . He developed the `` high rate pond system '' of shallow , mixed raceway ponds to maximize algae productivity . This design is still in use today , responsible for over 90 % of the world 's commercial microalgae production . His work led to the development of the `` Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond System '' , in which wastewater flows through a series of ponds , starting with deeper `` facultative '' ponds , then high rate ponds , and finally maturation ponds . The research undertaken by Oswald and his students and collaborators provided the foundations for much of modern microalgae wastewater treatment technology . Wastewater treatment plants based on his designs operate throughout the world today.With broader implications in energy and nutrient cycles , Oswald ’ s work often crossed over into related fields such as waste energy recovery , biofuels , animal feeds , and waste nutrient reuse . The Air Force ’ s interest in waste and nutrient recycling for long term space missions led to Oswald ’ s development of the Algatron–a device that would grow microalgae on astronaut waste , treating water and also producing oxygen and food.An archive of Oswald 's work is maintained by former student and long time collaborator Tryg Lundquist , now a professor of Environmental Engineering at Cal Poly , San Luis Obispo .   
    
    
 == Awards and honors ==   
 Oswald was recognized throughout his career . He received the Harrison Prescott Eddy Medal in 1953 from the Water Pollution Control Federation ( now known as the Water Environment Federation ) for describing photosynthetic oxygenation . The American Society of Civil Engineers awarded him both the Rudolf Hering Medal and the James Croes Medal in 1957 for work describing the fixation of nutrients and capture of solar energy by microalgae and the Arthur M. Wellington Award in 1966 for various investigations of life support systems for extended space travel . In 2005 he was awarded the lifetime achievement prize of the International Society for Applied Phycology and in 2006 he was nominated for the Stockholm Water Prize .

 = Ernst Julius Richard Ewald =   
Ernst Julius Richard Ewald ( 14 February 1855 – 22 July 1921 ) was a German physiologist born in Berlin . He was a younger brother to gastroenterologist Carl Anton Ewald ( 1845-1915 ) .   
 In 1880 , after finishing his studies in mathematics , physics and medicine , he became an assistant to physiologist Friedrich Goltz ( 1834-1902 ) at the University of Strasbourg . In 1900 he succeeded Goltz as chair of physiology at Strasbourg , a position he maintained until 1918 .   
 Ewald is best remembered for his research of the vestibular system of the inner ear , which largely involved experiments performed on the semicircular canal system of pigeons . From these studies the so-called `` Ewald laws '' are derived , which deal with the effects of endolymph motion on body , head and eye movements and also on the phenomena of excitation-inhibition asymmetries in the vestibular system .   
 Ewald 's first law : `` The axis of nystagmus parallels the anatomic axis of the semicircular canal that generated it '' .   
 Ewald 's second law : `` Ampullopetal endolymphatic flow produces a stronger response than ampullofugal flow in the horizontal canal '' .   
 Ewald 's third law : `` Ampullofugal flow produces a stronger response than ampullpetal flow in the vertical canals ( anterior and posterior semicircular canals ) .In 1892 he was given an award by the Paris Academy of Sciences for his monograph `` Physiologische Untersuchungen über das Endorgan des Nervus octavus '' .

 = Alice Leigh-Smith =   
Alice Leigh-Smith ( née Prebil ) , born September 11 , 1907 , was a Croatian born nuclear physicist . She is best known for being the first woman in British history to receive a PhD in nuclear physics . Additionally , she is remembered for her pioneering research in cancer and for her attempts in the discovery of an elusive element , Element 85 .   
    
    
 == Professional life ==   
 At the age of 25 in 1932 , Prebil began working at the Radium Institute in Paris under the tutelage of Marie Curie . Three years later , in 1935 , at the age of 28 , she would become the first woman in Great Britain to receive a PhD in nuclear physics . It is accepted that Leigh-Smith defended her thesis in London , however it is currently unknown from what university she was granted her degree.Dr . Alice Leigh-Smith was also involved in the use of radioactive substances as a treatment for cancer . From 1936 , she conducted cancer research as part of the British Empire cancer campaign . From 1938 to 1940 , during the Second World War , Alice Leigh-Smith was at the University of Bern in Switzerland , where she continued her work . In January 1943 , the anticipation of results from her study regarding the treatment of cancer with radioactive substances was published in the London Times . However , no results are available for current analysis .   
 In 1942 , Leigh-Smith and a Swiss chemist , Walter Minder jointly announced the discovery of element 85 ( now called astatine ) in 1942 . They proposed the name anglohelvetium for the new element , in order to honor both of their home countries- `` anglo '' for Leigh-Smith 's England and `` Helvetia '' after the personification of Minder 's country- Switzerland . This was Minder 's second attempt at discovering the element . It was later proven that Walter Minder and Alice Leigh-Smith had not discovered element 85 , after the failure of their results to be replicable .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 In 1933 , at the age of 26 , she married Philip Leigh-Smith , a British diplomat and son of the Arctic explorer Benjamin Leigh-Smith . His published comedy , `` Ladies in Diplomacy '' is purportedly based on the adventures of his wife , Alice .   
 Alice Leigh-Smith , had one child by her husband Philip Leigh-Smith . Christopher Leigh-Smith was Alice 's only child and is alive today , acting as an entrepreneur based in Switzerland .

 = Max Henius =   
Max Henius ( June 16 , 1859 – November 15 , 1935 ) was a Danish-American biochemist who specialized in the fermentation processes . Max Henius co-founded the American Academy of Brewing in Chicago .   
    
    
 == Background ==   
 Henius was born in Aalborg , Denmark . His parents were Isidor Henius ( 1820–1901 ) and Emilie ( née Wasserzug ) Henius ( 1839–1913 ) , both Polish Jewish immigrants . His father , who was born in Thorn , West Prussia , now Torun , Poland , emigrated to Denmark in 1837 and continued his work for spirits distillers to improve and standardise production and later – on January 15 , 1846 – co-founded one distillery , Aalborg priviligerede Sirup- og Spritfabrik , that was later , together with several other distilleries , consolidated into De Danske Spritfabrikker in 1881 , a Danish distillery which – since 2012 – is part of the Norwegian Arcus Group , which closed the distillery in Aalborg in 2015 , moving production to Norway instead . Isidor Henius also owned a small castle in Aalborg , now called Sohngaardsholm Slot . Since 2005 , it has been the site of a gourmet restaurant.Max Henius was educated at the Aalborg Latin School and went on to study at the Polytechnic Institute in Hanover , Germany He attended the University of Marburg , earning his Ph.D. degree in chemistry during 1881 . His father sold the distillery that same year . Max Henius subsequently emigrated from Aalborg to the United States in 1881 at the age of 22 , settling in Chicago . His younger brother , Erik S. Henius , ( 1863–1926 ) remained in Denmark where he was Chairman of the Danish Export Association .   
 He had another brother , Louis Henius ( 1870-1938 ) , who was the grandfather of author Suzanne Brøgger .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Initially he was employed by the Northern Pacific Railway on an assignment to test the waters between Fargo , North Dakota , and Bozeman , Montana . In 1886 , he opened a drug store . Subsequently he formed Wahl & Henius , an institute for chemical and mechanical analysis , with his former schoolmate , Robert Wahl ( 1858–1937 ) . Founded in 1891 , the Chicago-based American Brewing Academy ( later known as the Wahl-Henius Institute of Fermentology ) was one of the premier brewing schools of the pre-prohibition era . This institute was later expanded with a brew master school that operated until 1921.At the beginning of the twentieth century , Max Henius became interested in Danish-American organizations in Chicago . Funds were being raised by Danish Americans to purchase 200 acres ( 0.81 km2 ) of heather-covered hills , located in part of Rold Forest ( Danish : Rold Skov ) , Denmark 's largest forest . In 1912 Max Henius presented the deed to H.M. King Christian X as a permanent memorial from Danish Americans . Rebild National Park ( Danish : Rebild Bakker ) is today a Danish national park situated near the town of Skørping in Rebild municipality , Region Nordjylland in northern Jutland , Denmark .   
    
 Every July 4 since 1912 , except during the two world wars , large crowds have gathered in the heather-covered hills of Rebild to celebrate American Independence Day . On the slope north of Rebild , where the residence of Max Henius was once located , a bust was placed in his memory .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 He married Danish-born Johanne Louise Heiberg ( 1860–1934 ) on June 4 , 1883 . She was daughter of MD Emil Theodor Heiberg and Johanne ( Hanne ) Henriette Jacoba Schmidt . They had three children , Henry , Emil , and Gerda . Their great-grandchildren include actors Keith Carradine , Robert Carradine , Christopher Carradine , and Michael Bowen .

 = Nathaniel S. Keith =   
Nathaniel Shepard Keith ( July 14 , 1838 – January 27 , 1925 ) was an American manufacturer , chemist , inventor , writer , and electrical engineer . Keith was born in Boston , Massachusetts and worked in his fathers laboratory . He was instrumental in designing , manufacturing , and installing the original electric lighting and power system in San Francisco , California . In 1884 he became editor of Electric World , co-founded the American Institute of Electrical Engineers ( AIEE ) and served as the first secretary of the organization . The AIEE merged with other societies in 1963 to become the IEEE , the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers .   
 Biography .   
 N. S. Keith grew up experimenting in his father 's laboratory in New York City . He was educated in the common schools of Dover , N. H. and New York City , and attended the New York University Medical School , but never practiced medicine . He also learned the basics of chemistry in the laboratory of his father , Bethuel Keith & Co. , a physician and chemist in drug manufacturer ( Bethuel Keith 1811-1884 ) . In 1860 , at age 22 , he followed the Pikes Peak Gold Rush to Colorado where he spent nearly a decade mining and milling in the Central City-Blackhawk area . He experimented with various processes to work the rebellious gold ores ( see `` Ore Roasting Furnace '' Patent No . 36437 , Sept 9 , 1862 ) . Although the `` Keith Process '' of ore crushing and smelting worked in the laboratory , he failed to perfect the system on an industrial scale . He was superintendent of several mining operations , including the well known Mammoth mine , which closed when the vein pinched out .   
 Returning to the East by 1870 , he became a respected New York City chemist and began experimenting with electricity . He operated nickel plating works in Newark and patented a method to remove tin from scrap , patented in 1876 . He also patented early electric lights and motors , among the earliest patents . He was active in professional organizations , being a co-founder of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and editor and founder of Electronic World . At the same time he authored Magnetic and Dynamo-Electric Machines ( 1884 ) and translated German texts on electric motors . Lured West again , in 1884 he built the first electric plant for San Francisco . Between 1884 and 1893 he was among the first to apply electricity to mining , especially electro-metallurgy . Located in San Francisco he served as consultant to mining companies across the West . He would also patent several more pieces of mine machinery ( a ball crusher [ the `` Keith Pulverizer '' ] ) and amalgamation equipment ( the commonly used centrifugal electrical amalgamation machine ) . In San Francisco , he also sold electric motors to meet burgeoning demand , but sold out with the crash of 1893 .   
 During much of 1893-1897 he was in England trying to promote his electro-metallurgical process for the extraction of precious metals from their ores . He returned to the United States and became an advisor to Thomas Edison , based in Philadelphia . He worked on the ill-fated electro-magnetic mining operations funded by Edison . He also worked on electric extraction of copper from its ores , helping organize a company to test his process in the old copper mines of New Jersey . At the time of his death he was still director or officer in a number of mining companies , including the Metals Recovery Company and the American Mines & Venture Corporation.He married Anna Tait Swan in New York in 1860 and all three of their daughters were born in Black Hawk , Colorado—Virginia ( 1862 ) , Harriet ( 1866 ) , and Elma ( 1867 ) . None married , but taught in a college in New York City . Anna Keith died July 2 , 1909 in Philadelphia . Nathaniel Shepherd Keith died January 27 , 1925 in Philadelphia .

 = Gerard Salton =   
Gerard A . `` Gerry '' Salton ( 8 March 1927 in Nuremberg – 28 August 1995 ) , was a Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University . Salton was perhaps the leading computer scientist working in the field of information retrieval during his time , and `` the father of Information Retrieval '' . His group at Cornell developed the SMART Information Retrieval System , which he initiated when he was at Harvard . It was the very first system to use the now popular vector space model for Information Retrieval .   
 Salton was born Gerhard Anton Sahlmann on March 8 , 1927 in Nuremberg , Germany . He received a Bachelor 's ( 1950 ) and Master 's ( 1952 ) degree in mathematics from Brooklyn College , and a Ph.D. from Harvard in Applied Mathematics in 1958 , the last of Howard Aiken 's doctoral students , and taught there until 1965 , when he joined Cornell University and co-founded its department of Computer Science .   
 Salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used vector space model for Information Retrieval . In this model , both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts , and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector . In this paper , he also introduced TF-IDF , or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency , a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs . ( The concept of inverse document frequency , a measure of specificity , had been introduced in 1972 by Karen Sparck-Jones . ) Later in life , he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis , as well as automatic hypertext generation . He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life .   
 Salton was editor-in-chief of the Communications of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM , and chaired Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval ( SIGIR ) . He was an associate editor of the ACM Transactions on Information Systems . He was an ACM Fellow ( elected 1995 ) , received an Award of Merit from the American Society for Information Science ( 1989 ) , and was the first recipient of the SIGIR Award for outstanding contributions to study of Information Retrieval ( 1983 ) -- now called the Gerard Salton Award .

 = Adolph Diesterweg =   
Friedrich Adolph Wilhelm Diesterweg ( 29 October 1790 – 7 July 1866 ) was a German educator , thinker , and progressive liberal politician , who campaigned for the secularization of schools . He is said to be precursory to the reform of pedagogy .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
 Educated at Herborn and Tübingen universities 1808-1811 , Diesterweg began teaching in 1811 . He taught at Mannheim and at Worms for about two years , and then moved to the model school in Frankfurt am Main . Later he became rector of the Latin school of Elberfeld . In 1820 , he was appointed director of the new teacher 's seminary at Mörs where he put in practice the methods of Pestalozzi . In 1832 , he was summoned to Berlin to direct the new state-schools seminary in that city . Here he proved himself a strong supporter of nonsectarian religious teaching . In 1846 , he established the Pestalozzi institution at Pankow , and the Pestalozzi societies for the support of teachers ’ widows and orphans . Because of his disagreement with the authorities regarding important phases of higher education he was in constant friction and resigned from the seminary in 1847 . In 1850 , he received a government pension . Thereafter , he continued to vigorously advocate his educational ideas through the medium of periodicals . In 1858 , he was elected to the chamber of deputies as member for the city of Berlin , and voted with the Liberal opposition .   
    
    
 == Philosophy ==   
 Diesterweg thought criticalness and responsibility were important in teaching , and sought to reform social , economic and moral aspects of education publishing the influential Pädagogisch Wollen und Sollen . He based his program on what was named the `` basic principles of the struggle for life '' that he saw in the Catholicism/Protestantism conflict . He thought there were several 'oppositions ' ( distinct choices ) that were available in the conflict which could be reduced to a single `` authority or freedom , Catholicism or Protestantism '' .   
    
 In his effort to reform schooling Diesterweg wanted to remove political and religious influence in the teaching itself and instead involve more of a social factor . He believed in the availability of education : `` First educate men , before worrying about their professional training or class , [ because ] the proletarian and the peasant should both be educated to become human beings '' ; he also believed that through education the poor could be helped . He wanted professionalization of state teachers and fought for the relative autonomy of schools ; he also had an influence on the teachers of that time through his newspaper Rheinisch Blätter .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Diesterweg was a voluminous writer on educational subjects , and was the author of various school text-books . He authored 50 books and published about 400 papers ; he has been credited with originated the phrase 'learn to do by doing ' by one source .   
 In 1851 , he founded the Pädagogisches Jahrbuch ( Yearbook of pedagogy ) in Berlin . Among his publications were :   
    
 Wegweiser zur Bildung für deutsche Lehrer ( Guide for the instruction of German teachers ; 2 vols. , 1834 ; 6th ed. , 1 vol. , 1890 )   
 Das pädagogische Deutschland ( German pedagogy ; 1836 )   
 Streitfragen auf dem Gebiete der Pädagogik ( Controversial questions in the field of pedagogy ; 1837 )   
 Leitfaden für den Unterricht in der Formlehre ( 1845 )   
 Lehrbuch der mathematischen Geographie ( 1840 ; 18th ed. , as Populäre Himmelskunde , 1891 )   
 Unterricht in der Kleinkinderschule ( 5th ed. , 1852 )

 = Sten Malmquist =   
Sten Malmquist ( 1917 – March 11 , 2004 ) was a Swedish economist and statistician . He is among others famous for having constructed the Malmquist index .   
 Malmquist was born in Lund , and his father 's work as an astronomer took the family first to Saltsjöbaden and then to Uppsala . After collaborating with Herman Wold on econometric studies of consumer demand , Malmquist got his Ph.D. in statistics from Uppsala University in 1948 . Malmquist 's work on duality and the metric theory of utility is still used in microeconomic theory . In 1954 , he was appointed professor at Stockholm University College , later known as Stockholm University , and remained there until his retirement in 1983 .   
 Malquist also published in probability theory , where he found a formula for the boundary probability for the Brownian motion within a finite time interval .

 = Lorenz Kellner =   
Lorenz Kellner ( born at Kalteneber in the district of Eichsfeld , 29 January 1811 ; died at Trier , 18 August 1892 ) was a German educator .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was the son of Heinrich Kellner who had been a pupil of Pestalozzi at Yverdon and had introduced Pestalozzi 's methods at the normal school he conducted , the first of its kind in the Catholic district of Eichsfeld . Out of these private courses for the training of elementary school-teachers developed a seminary for teachers at Heiligenstadt .   
 Lorenz Kellner graduated at the Gymnasium Josephinum at Hildesheim , and then studied at the evangelical seminary for teachers at Magdeburg . After being a teacher at the Catholic elementary school at Erfurt for two years , he was made rector of the school .   
 In 1836 his father 's normal school was enlarged into a seminary for teachers , of which the elder Kellner remained the head while Lorenz was made his only assistant . In 1848 von Eichhorn , the Prussian minister of worship and education , called Lorenz to Marienwerder in West Prussia as member of the government district council and of the school-board . After seven years at Marienwerder , Kellner was summoned to fill the same offices at Trier . Since there were at this date no institutions for the training of teachers in Trier , Kellner founded several seminaries both for male and female teachers during the twenty-nine years of his official activity here .   
 In 1863 the Academy of Münster in Westphalia made Kellner Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa , in recognition of his services on behalf of the German language and of pedagogics .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 In his major work , `` Praktischer Lehrgang für den deutschen Unterricht '' ( 1837–40 ) , the teaching of grammar was systematically connected with the reading-book . This was , for that period , a very important advance when contrasted with the current methods of grammatical instruction . In 1850 appeared his best-known work , `` Zur Pädagogik der Schule und des Hauses . Aphorismen '' , which was translated into several languages . It contains altogether 178 essays which cover the entire field of training and teaching .   
 His `` Skizzen und Bilder aus der Erziehungsgeschichte '' ( 3 vols. , 1862 ) was the first treatment of the history of pedagogics by a Catholic author . Kellner 's `` Kurze Geschichte der Erziehung und des Unterrichts '' ( 1877 ) is a book of practical suggestions for teachers ; his `` Volksschulkunde '' was a theoretical and practical guide for Catholic teachers of both sexes , school inspectors , and seminaries . Other works were `` Lebensblätter , Erinnerungen aus der Schulwelt '' ( 1891 ) and the posthumous `` Lose Blätter , Pädagog . Zeitbetrachtungen und Ratschläge von Kellner '' ( 1897 ) .

 == Biography ==   
 Hansen 's father William G Hansen , who was a son of immigrants from Denmark , was a hardware store owner in Fresno , California . He encouraged his son 's early talent in mathematics and enthusiasm for electronics . He entered Stanford University at the age of 16 , earning his B.A . in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1933.Hansen went on to become interested in the problem of accelerating electrons for X-ray experiments , using oscillating fields , rather than large static voltages . At the University of California , Berkeley , Ernest Lawrence and his assistant David H. Sloan , had worked on an accelerator driven by a resonant coil . Hansen proposed replacing the coil with a cavity resonator . In 1937 , brothers Russel H. Varian and Sigurd F. Varian came to Stanford to work on the foundations of what was to become radar . Hansen exploited some of the Varian 's work to develop the klystron and during the years 1937 to 1940 , along with collaborators such as John R. Woodyard , founded the field of microwave electronics .   
 In 1941 , he moved his team to the Sperry Gyroscope Company where they spent the war years employing their expertise in radar applications and in other problems.Returning to Stanford in 1945 as a full professor , he embarked on the construction of a series of linear accelerators based on klystron technology and of GeV performance . Along with the Varian brothers and Edward Ginzton , he co-founded Varian Associates in 1948 . Sadly , he was never to see the completion of the klystron project . He died at age 39 in Palo Alto , California of berylliosis and fibrosis of the lungs , caused by inhaling the beryllium used in his research . In 1947 , the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory ( HEPL ) was founded as a facility at Stanford University . The facility is designed to promote interdisciplinary enterprises across different branches of science and was named in his honor .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 In October 1938 , William Webster Hansen married Betsy Ross , who was the younger daughter of Perley Ason Ross , professor of physics at Stanford . Shortly after his death Betsy committed suicide . Their only child died six months after his birth during the fall of 1947 .

 = John Edward Anderson (psychologist) =   
John Edward Anderson ( 1893–1966 ) was an American psychologist . He was the 52nd president of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) in 1943 , and editor of Psychological Bulletin from 1942 to 1946 . He also made significant contributions to the field of child psychology .   
    
    
 == Early Life ==   
 Anderson was born in Laramie , Wyoming ( 1893 ) and completed his undergraduate work at the University of Wyoming . He travelled east to complete his doctorate in psychology at Harvard University . After graduating , he entered military service during World War I and became the head instructor at the School of Military Psychology at Camp Greenleaf in Georgia . He married Dorothea Lynde of Chattanooga , Tennessee .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 In 1919 , Anderson was hired by Yale University . He also assumed the role of Secretary of the APA . In 1925 , he moved to the University of Minnesota to become Director of their Rockefeller-funded Institute for Child Welfare . In 1930 , he served as Chairman of the Conference Committee on the Infant and Pre-school for the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection , which resulted in twenty volumes on the progress in social welfare , health care , and educational facilities of young children . Over the course of the 1930s he published two books on child psychology and co-authored the Minnesota Occupational Scale with Florence Goodenough .   
 Anderson 's most significant scientific contributions are said to have been a 1939 article on the limitations of intelligence testing with very young children . In 1942 , he became editor of Psychological Bulletin , and he was elected president of the APA . His presidency coincided with World War II , so he was a key player in the contentious merger between the old science-oriented APA and the newer practice-oriented American Association for Applied Psychology . This marked the start of the modern APA.Relinquishing his editorship of Psychological Bulletin after a single term , Anderson immediately wrote a classic chapter on the methods of child psychology which appeared in Leonard Carmichael 's 1946 Manual of Child Psychology . He served in executive roles on number of professional and scientific organizations , including Vice President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( Section I , Psychology ) and President of the Society for Research in Child Development .

The term netizen is a portmanteau of the words Internet and citizen , as in a `` citizen of the net '' or `` net citizen . '' It describes a person actively involved in online communities or the Internet in general.The term commonly also implies an interest and active engagement in improving the Internet , making it an intellectual and a social resource , or its surrounding political structures , especially in regard to open access , net neutrality and free speech . The term was widely adopted in the mid-1990s as a way to describe those who inhabit the new geography of the Internet . Internet pioneer and author Michael F. Hauben is credited with coining and popularizing the term .

 In Chinese , the terms wǎngmín ( 网民 , literally `` net-people '' ) and wǎngyǒu ( 网友 , literally `` net-friend '' ) are commonly used terms meaning `` Internet users '' , and the English word netizen is used by mainland China-based English language media to translate both terms , resulting in the frequent appearance of that English word in media reporting about China , far more frequently than the use of the word in other contexts .

He is also known for the Paschen series , a series of hydrogen spectral lines in the infrared region that he first observed in 1908 . He established the now widely used Paschen curve in his article `` Über die zum Funkenübergang in Luft , Wasserstoff und Kohlensäure bei verschiedenen Drücken erforderliche Potentialdifferenz '' . He is known for the Paschen-Back effect , which is the Zeeman effect 's becoming non-linear at high magnetic field . He helped explain the hollow cathode effect in 1916 .

 = Edwin Cannan =   
Edwin Cannan ( 3 February 1861 , Funchal , Madeira – 8 April 1935 , Bournemouth ) , the son of David Cannan and artist Jane Cannan , was a British economist and historian of economic thought . He was a professor at the London School of Economics from 1895 to 1926 .   
 As a partisan of Jevonianism , Edwin Cannan is perhaps best known for his logical dissection and destruction of Classical theory in his famous 1894 tract A History of the Theories of Production and Distribution . Although Cannan had personal and professional difficulties with Alfred Marshall , he was still `` Marshall 's man '' at the LSE from 1895 to 1926 . During that time , particularly during his long stretch as chairman after 1907 , Edwin Cannan shepherded the LSE away from its roots in Fabian socialism into tentative Marshallianism . This period was only to last , however , until his protégé , Lionel Robbins , took over with his more `` Continental '' ideas .   
 Though Cannan , in his early years as an economist , was a critic of classical economics and an ally of interventionists , he moved sharply to the side of classical liberalism in the early 20th century . He favored a simplicity , clarity , and common sense in the exposition of economics . According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson , Cannan `` emphasised the institutional foundation of economic systems '' .

 = Frank Debenham =   
Frank Debenham , OBE ( 26 December 1883 – 23 November 1965 ) was Emeritus Professor of Geography at the Department of Geography , Cambridge University and first director of the Scott Polar Research Institute .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Debenham was born in Bowral , New South Wales , Australia in December 1883 , the younger twin and third child of Rev . John Willmott Debenham and Edith ( née Cleveland ) . He attended the school run by his father before attending The King 's School , Parramatta where he was the top academic and sporting student of his year . He graduated from the University of Sydney with a BA in English and philosophy , then joined the staff at the Anglican Armidale School in New South Wales .   
 He returned to university in 1908 , studying geology under Sir Edgeworth David . In 1910 he was one of a group of three geologists on Robert Falcon Scott 's Antarctic Terra Nova Expedition ( 1910–1913 ) . From January to March 1911 Debenham , along with three other expedition members ( Thomas Griffith Taylor , Charles Wright ( physicist ) and Edgar Evans ) , explored and mapped the western mountains of Victoria Land ( the western journey ) performing scientific studies and geological observations . He did not take part in the ill-fated journey to the South pole due to a knee injury sustained while playing football in the snow , and instead took part in the second western journey along with Griffith Taylor , Tryggve Gran and William Forde . On his return from the expedition in 1913 , he entered Cambridge University to write up his field notes .   
 During World War I , he was a lieutenant with the 7th Battalion , Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry . Serving in France and Salonika , Debenham was severely wounded in August 1916 . He married Dorothy Lucy Lempriere in January 1917 and was awarded the Order of the British Empire ( O.B.E . ) in 1919 . The same year he went to Cambridge where he became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College and lecturer in cartography . In 1920 , with the help of surplus funds raised by public donations in response to the tragedy , Debenham co-founded the Scott Polar Research Institute ( Cambridge University ) with Raymond Priestley , as a repository of polar information and a centre from which future expeditions could draw on support and experience . Debenham had developed the idea of such a learning centre in 1912 while in Antarctica . He was unpaid director of the Institute from 1920 to 1946 . As director of the institute , Debenham , in conjunction with Priestley and one of Shackleton 's Endurance scientists , James Wordie , made Cambridge the centre of polar research in Britain .   
 In 1931 , Debenham was appointed Professor of Geography at Cambridge University . During World War II he trained service cadets , lectured to Royal Air Force navigators and devised relief-model techniques for briefing commandos . Author of `` Astrographics : First Steps in Navigation by the Stars '' , the 2 editions in 1942 were important works for the R.A.F . 's forthcoming Bomber offensive against the 3rd Reich . He was vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society ( 1951–53 ) and was awarded their Victoria Medal in 1948.Debenam was a prolific author ; his published works include : `` In the Antarctic : Stories of Scott 's Last Expedition 1952 '' ; `` Antarctica – The story of a continent '' ; `` Discovery & Exploration '' ; `` Kalahari Sand '' ; `` Nyasaland '' ; `` The way to Ilala '' ; `` Study of African Swamp '' ; `` Simple Surveying '' ; `` The use of Geography '' ; `` Map Making '' ; `` The World is Round '' ; `` Space – The Global Atlas '' .

 = L C3 A9on Talabot =   
Joseph Léon Talabot ( 5 February 1796 – 23 September 1863 ) was a French engineer , iron master and politician .   
 He advocated protectionist policies to maintain the prices of iron and steel . He was the founder of the Denain-Anzin steelworks .   
    
    
 == Early years ==   
 Joseph Léon Talabot was born on 5 February 1796 in Limoges , Haute-Vienne .   
 His father , Francois Talabot ( 1764–1839 ) , was a lawyer , and his mother was Marie Agathe Martin-Lagrave .   
 He had seven siblings , including the railway and canal engineer Paulin Talabot ( 1799–1885 ) .   
 He received formal training as an engineer .   
 Talabot operated the joint-stock Saut-du-Tarn steel making company near Albi , Tarn , which had been founded in the 1920s by capitalists from Toulouse .   
 In 1836 Talabot 's Forges et Laminoirs d'Anzin was founded to make rails for use by the proposed Northern Railroad .   
 Talabot was the engineer in chief of the Paris-Dijon railway .   
    
    
 == Politician ==   
 Talabot was elected deputy for Limoges , Haute-Vienne , on 23 January 1836 , replacing Pierre-Alpinien Bourdeau , who had resigned .   
 He was reelected on 4 November 1837 , 2 March 1839 , 9 July 1842 and 1 August 1846 .   
 He sat in the center left , among the supports of Adolphe Thiers .   
 In 1842 , during the debates over the railway laws , he organized a lobby of deputies from the Center and the Midi .   
 In 1846 the Association pour la défense du Travail national was formed to promote protectionist policies .   
 The council included Antoine Odier ( President ) , Auguste Mimerel ( Vice-President ) , Joseph Périer ( Treasurer ) and Louis-Martin Lebeuf ( Secretary ) .   
 Members included Henri Barbet , Léon Talabot , Eugène Schneider and Jules Hochet .   
 The Association , and Talabot personally , was opposed to the reform of the customs system advocated by Laurent Cunin-Gridaine .   
 Talabot 's political career ended with the French Revolution of 1848 .   
    
    
 == Later career ==   
 In 1849 Talabot merged the Forges et Laminoirs d'Anzin with the nearby Serret , Lelièvre , Dumont et Cie company of Denain to form the Société des hauts-fourneaux et des forges de Denain et Anzin , the largest metallurgical company in the Nord Department .   
 Talabot managed Denain-Anzin after the merger .   
 In 1850 the French iron masters created an Assemblée Générale des Maîtres de Forges de France , under the presidency of Léon Talabot .   
 At the end of the year it took the name of Comité des Maîtres de Forges . In 1855 Talabot assumed the title of president of the Comité des Forges .   
 In 1860 the Inspector-General of Mines , Combes , wrote to the Minister of Commerce that Talabot 's Comité des Forges would use whatever threats or arguments they felt likely to be effective in maintaining the price of iron .   
 In 1860 Talabot also became president of a new Association for the Defense of National Labor , which was opposed to lowering of tariffs.Talabot was made a knight of the Legion of Honour .   
 He died on 23 September 1863 in Soisy-sous-Montmorency , Val-d'Oise .   
 Baron Robert de Nervo married Léon Talabot 's daughter Lucie-Agathe ( 1844–73 ) on 31 October 1867 .   
 The Nervo family would make Denain-Anzin the fifth-largest steel producer in France by 1913 .

 = Ivey Foreman Lewis =   
Ivey Foreman Lewis ( August 31 , 1882 – March 16 , 1964 ) was an American botanist and geneticist who served for two decades as dean of the University of Virginia and helped found the Virginia Academy of Science . A proponent of eugenics throughout his career , in his final years , Lewis and his sister Nell Battle Lewis gained national attention for their opposition to racial desegregation in public education , especially the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Lewis was born in Raleigh , North Carolina to a prominent physician and public health official Richard Henry Lewis . He had two brothers . His father remarried twice . He had a half sister Nell Battle Lewis . Lewis earned a B.S . ( 1902 ) and M.S . ( 1903 ) at the University of North Carolina , and later a PhD at Johns Hopkins University ( 1908 ) .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 During his own post-graduate studies through Johns Hopkins in Baltimore , Maryland , Lewis taught Biology at Randolph–Macon College in Ashland , Virginia from 1905 to 1912 . After he received his PhD , Lewis accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Botany at the University of Wisconsin ( 1912 to 1914 ) . He then taught as Professor of Botany at the University of Missouri from 1914 to 1915 .   
 In 1915 , University of Virginia president Edwin A. Alderman recruited Lewis , who became Professor of Biology and Agriculture , and began to modernize the institution and increase its research output . Lewis became popular at the University , as well as important in the state 's scientific community—helping to found the Virginia Academy of Science and serving as its first president . Lewis was appointed Dean of the University in 1934 and ( after a reorganization ) , Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1946 , a position he held until his retirement in 1953 . He is buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery.Lewis 's signature course was Biology C1 : Evolution and Heredity . He provided much of the scientific rationale for the eugenics movement now best known for the discredited legal decision in Buck v. Bell ( 1927 ) . In the 1920s , Lewis championed the state 's Anglo-Saxon clubs as staving off apocalyptic `` racial decay '' , including giving a lecture `` What Biology Says to the Man of Today . '' Lewis thus worked with alumnus John Powell , Major Earnest S. Cox and Dr. Walter Plecker ( a physician who as state registrar vigorously enforced the 1924 Racial Integrity Act ) . Later , he consistently advised against hiring academicians who might question his group of eugenicists , or advocate environmental solutions to social problems , or even critically examine southern traditions , as well as criticized Jewish sociologists . Lewis had unsuccessfully opposed admission of Gregory Swanson , who matriculated at the University 's Law School in the fall of 1950 pursuant to a federal court order after the NAACP victories in Sweatt v. Painter and McLaurin v. Oklahoma , but Swanson left about a year later after encountering the `` overwhelming climate of racial hostility and harassment '' he had experienced . Thus Walter N. Ridley , a professor at Virginia State College who arrived a semester after Swanson actually became the first recipient of a postgraduate degree at UVA ( his PhD in education was the first such awarded a black man from a major Southern institution ) . During Virginia 's Massive Resistance crisis , mostly after his retirement , Lewis attempted to `` hold the line '' and limit desegregation to token individuals , taking an active part in the radical Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties .   
 Lewis was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and served as president of the American Society of Naturalists ( 1939 ) , American Biological Society ( 1942 ) , and the Botanical Society of America ( 1949 ) . The standard author abbreviation I.F.Lewis is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

 = Robert Cooke (physician) =   
Robert Anderson Cooke ( 1880–1960 ) was an American immunologist and allergist.In 1916 Cooke and Albert Vandeveer demonstrated the role of heredity in the origins of allergy . According to Cooke , 48 % of his allergic patients had allergies in their family history . While the trait of allergy is transmitted through heredity , parents and children may be allergic to different substances .   
 In 1918 , Dr. Cooke suggested a mechanism of action for allergen injections as a `` desensitization or hyposensitization , '' analogous to tolerance achieved in experimental anaphylaxis induced in animals . This concept suggested that the injections of an increasing amount of allergen or antigen slowly neutralized those antibodies responsible for the allergic reaction .

James `` Jim '' Hamilton ( 29 January 1918 , Sligo – 6 July 2000 ) was an Irish mathematician and theoretical physicist who , whilst at Dublin Institute for Advanced Sciences ( 1941-1943 ) , helped to develop the theory of cosmic-ray mesons with Walter Heitler and Hwan-Wu Peng.At the University of Manchester ( 1945-1949 ) , under Patrick Blackett , he worked on radiation damping and associated topics .   
 At the University of Cambridge , where he lectured in mathematics ( 1950–1960 ) , he was at the forefront of work on S-matrix theory , known for his use of dispersion relations . His work there included collaborations with Abdus Salam and Hans Bethe . During his last two years he was at the core , along with Richard Eden and George Batchelor , of founding the new Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics .   
 At University College , London ( 1960-1964 ) he formed a thriving high energy physics research group , before moving to Copenhagen and NORDITA , where he led the teaching of particle physics in Scandinavia from 1964 to 1983 .

Anatoly Vasilyevich Bogatyrev ( Belarusian : Анатоль Васільевіч Багатыроў , Russian : Анатолий Васильевич Богатырё́в ; August 13 [ O.S . July 31 ] 1913 – September 19 , 2003 ) was a Belarusian composer and music teacher , seen as one of the leaders of the national school of Belarusian music .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Bogatyrev was born in Vitebsk , the son of a language teacher . He studied at the Vitebsk Music School , the Minsk School of Music , and the Conservatory of Belarus where he was taught composition by Vasily Zolotarev , a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov . He came to prominence while still in his twenties , being appointed chairman of the board of the Belarusian Union of Composers in 1938 , and receiving the Stalin Prize in 1941 . In 1948 he began teaching composition at the National Conservatory , Minsk , where he later became a deputy director . He joined the CPSU in 1954 , and was made a People 's Artist of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1968 . Bogatyrev died on September 19 , 2003 in Minsk .   
    
    
 == Music ==   
 Bogatyrev 's music is tonal with marked nationalist tendencies . His study of Belarusian folklore strongly influenced his music , not just in his folksong arrangements , but also in his choice sometimes to adopt modes and the rhythms of Belarusian folk music . He has been described as `` one of the founders and leading representatives of the Belarusian school…Whether vocal or instrumental , his works are arresting for the richness of their melodies and for their polyphonic textures .

 = Giovanni Maria Lancisi =   
Giovanni Maria Lancisi ( 26 October 1654 – 20 January 1720 ) was an Italian physician , epidemiologist and anatomist who made a correlation between the presence of mosquitoes and the prevalence of malaria . He was also known for his studies about cardiovascular diseases , and is remembered in the eponymous Lancisi 's sign .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Giovanni Maria Lancisi ( Latin name : Johannes Maria Lancisius ) was educated at the Collegio Romano and the University of Rome , where he qualified in medicine aged 18 . He was physician to Popes Innocent XI , Clement XI and Innocent XII . He was given the lost anatomical plates of Bartolomeo Eustachius by Pope Clement XI ; these were made in 1562 and had been forgotten in the Vatican Library . Lancisi edited and published them in 1714 as the Tabulae anatomicae . He studied epidemiology , describing malaria and influenza epidemics . He published De Noxiis Paludum Effluviis ( On the Noxious Effluvia of Marshes ) in 1717 , in which he recognized that mosquito-infested swamps are the breeding ground for malaria and recommended drainage of these areas to prevent it . He also published extensively on cardiology , describing vegetations on heart valves , cardiac syphilis , aneurysms and the classification of heart disease . His landmark De Motu Cordis et Aneurysmatibus was published posthumously in 1728.Early in the 18th century , Lancisi had protested the medieval approaches to containing rinderpest in cattle by stating that `` it is better to kill all sick and suspect animals , instead of allowing the disease to spread in order to have enough time and the honour to discover a specific treatment that is often searched for without any success '' ( Mantovani and Zanetti , 1993 ) . Lancisi who made the first breakthrough in the control of rinderpest ( Lancisi , 1715 ) , a procedure that was later adopted by Thomas Bates ( Bates , 1718 ) .   
 However , Lancisi also erred , as he disputed the work of Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo ( 1663-1696 ) , his contemporary , who had correctly identified the cause of scabies as a parasite . Lancisi however felt scabies was of humoral origin . Because of Lancisi ’ s powerful position and , because previous scientists like Galileo Galilei had fallen into disgrace , Bonomo was silenced and his discovery was forgotten until the modern era .   
    
    
 == Brain & Soul Inquiries ==   
 Lancisi described the corpus callosum as the `` seat of the soul , which imagines , deliberates and judges . '' His Dissertatio Physiognomica provided the supporting argument in 1713 . He opposed alternative locations of the soul as hypothesized by others , such as the centrum ovale , by Andreas Vesalius , and the pineal gland , by René Descartes . He hypothesized that the Longitudinal striae ( later named in his honor as the `` striae lancisi '' or `` nerves of Lancisi '' ) were the conduit between the anterior location of the soul , and the posterior location of sensory organ functions , both within the corpus callosum .

Margaret Bushby Lascelles Cockburn ( 2 July 1829 – 26 March 1928 ) was an artist and amateur ornithologist who lived in the Nilgiris in India . She was born in Salem , India , and her father was the Collector of the District , M. D. Cockburn . The family initially visited Kotagiri in summer but settled permanently around 1855 at `` Hope Park '' . Cockburn experimented on tea planting at Alports Estate and made numerous observations on local natural history and many of these were reported in the works of Allan Octavian Hume . She also made paintings of local birds and flora . The Natural History Museum , London , produced a diary in 2002 with illustrations made by her of the fauna and flora of the Kotagiri region . A collection of butterflies was also bequeathed to the Natural History Museum .   
 She set up the first school for Badagas and contributed towards the construction of a church at Kotagiri in 1867 which was later taken over by the Basel Mission . A subspecies of Anthus similis from the Nilgiri region was named after her , but this is no longer considered valid .

Hans Kauri ( until 1935 , Hans Mühlberg ; May 30 , 1906 – January 30 , 1999 ) was an Estonian entomologist , zoologist , and politician . He also worked with other groups of fauna , especially arachnids . He had a strong impact on zoological studies at the University of Bergen .   
 One biographer characterized Kauri as follows : `` in all areas he created a professional stimulating environment for both young and older researchers . However , he was a very determined gentleman , who asserted his ideas and opinions with great strength . ''   
    
    
 == Estonia and Sweden ==   
 Kauri studied zoology at the University of Tartu in Estonia . He was interested in dragonflies and damselflies ( Odonata ) . During this time he also worked on a manuscript , but it was lost in a fire during the Second World War . His doctoral dissertation on spiders ( Arachnoidea ) also suffered the same fate . Kauri was forced to flee Estonia during the Soviet occupation of Estonia , and he arrived in Sweden in 1944 . There he became an assistant and later a lecturer at the Zoological Institution in Lund . He earned a doctorate on amphibians , although his field of work was horse-flies .

 Kauri later relocated to Norway and was employed at the Bergen Zoological Museum in 1963 , in a new professorship of zoology , with an emphasis on terrestrial invertebrates . The position included heading the museum , as well as lecturing on classification , faunistics , ecology , and animal geography . The former professorship also covered marine biology .   
 Kauri had a great impact on the zoological institute at the University of Bergen . The number of students increased significantly . Kauri had an enthusiasm and dedication to work that few could match , and he built a viable institute with classification and ecology as it key elements . He retired in 1976 but remained engaged at the museum for several years after that .

 = Victor-Auguste-Isidor Deschamps =   
Victor Augustin Isidore Dechamps ( 6 December 1810 , in Melle – 29 September 1883 , in Mechelen ) was a Belgian Archbishop of Mechlin , Cardinal and Primate of Belgium .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He and his brothers made rapid progress in science under their father 's direction . One , Adolphe Deschamps , entered on a political career . Victor pursued his ecclesiastical studies first at the seminary of Tournai and then in the Catholic University begun at Mechlin and afterwards transferred to Louvain .   
 Ordained priest 20 December 1834 , he entered the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer in 1835 , and made his vows 13 June 1836 . The next four years he spent at Wittem as prefect of students and lector in dogmatic theology . In 1840 he began his missionary life and in 1842 was nominated rector at Liège . He took an active part in the founding of the Confraternity of the Holy Family , which he considered his most salutary work . In the historic jubilee of Liège he had a large share both by his `` Le plus beau souvenir de l'histoire de Liège '' , and by his preaching ( 1845–46 ) .   
 He visited England and saw the effects of the Tractarian movement . In 1849 he was nominated consultor general of his congregation , and took up his residence at Pagani near Naples just when Pope Pius IX was in exile at Gaeta . He had several audiences with the pope and was instrumental in arranging the transfer of the superior general from Pagani to Rome . This was not effected till 1855 , when Pius IX invited Father Dechamps to the first general chapter held in Rome . The question of his appointment to the See of Liège was considered in 1852 , but the pope , touched by his personal appeal , did not insist . In 1865 Dechamps became Bishop of Namur , whence he was transferred in 1875 to the Archdiocese of Mechlin and made primate .   
 He took an active part in the formation of the Pontifical Zouaves , and persuaded General Lamoricière to offer his services to Pius IX . He battled for Catholic schools and defended papal infallibility before and during the Vatican Council . Cardinal Manning and Dechamps were indefatigable ; and they became cardinals in the same consistory , 15 March 1875 . Cardinal Deschamps was appointed Cardinal-Priest of San Bernardo alle Terme . Dechamps worked to the very end . He said Mass on 28 September 1883 , and died the day following in the arms of a Redemptorist who happened to be present . He was buried , as he had desired , by the side of Joseph Passerat at Rumilliers .   
 The complete works of Dechamps , revised by himself , were published in seventeen volumes at Mechlin . In presenting fourteen of the seventeen volumes to Pope Leo XIII on 7 February 1879 , the author writes : `` There is one thing that consoles me , Holy Father , in sending you my poor works : they are all consecrated to the truths of our holy Faith ... . Volume I is consecrated to the truths of faith ; II to Our Lord Jesus Christ ; V to the Blessed Virgin Mary ; III and IV to the Church and St. Peter ; VI to the pope and his infallibility ; VII , VIII , and IX to the refutation of modern errors ; X , XI , XII , XIII , and XIV to my preaching as bishop and to acts by which I governed my diocese . '' Of the remaining volumes , XV , `` Mélanges '' , deals with many important questions ; XVI and XVII contain letters on questions in philosophy , theology , and other subjects .   
 Cardinal Dechamps 's brother , Adolphe Deschamps , served as minister of public works from 16 April 1843 to 30 July 1845 , and as minister of foreign affairs until 12 August 1847 .

 = Ernst Stueckelberg =   
Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg ( baptised as Johann Melchior Ernst Karl Gerlach Stückelberg , full name after 1911 : Baron Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg von Breidenbach zu Breidenstein und Melsbach ; 1 February 1905 – 4 September 1984 ) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist , regarded as one of the most eminent physicists of the 20th century . Despite making key advances in theoretical physics , including the exchange particle model of fundamental forces , causal S-matrix theory , and the renormalization group , his idiosyncratic style and publication in minor journals led to his work being unrecognized until the mid-1990s .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Born into a semi-aristocratic family in Basel in 1905 , Stueckelberg 's father was a lawyer , and his paternal grandfather a distinguished Swiss artist . A highly gifted school student , Stueckelberg initially began a physics degree at the University of Basel in 1923 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 While still a student , Stueckelberg was invited by the distinguished quantum theorist Arnold Sommerfeld , to attend his lectures at the University of Munich . He went on to gain a Ph.D. on cathode physics in 1927 . Later that year he went to Princeton University , becoming an assistant professor in 1930 .   
 He returned to Switzerland in 1932 , working first at the University of Basel before switching the following year to the University of Zurich . In 1934 he moved again to the University of Geneva , which together with the University of Lausanne became his principal bases for the rest of his career .   
 Stueckelberg 's sojourn in Zurich led to contact with leading quantum theorists Wolfgang Pauli and Gregor Wentzel , which in turn led him to focus on the emerging theory of elementary particles .   
 In 1934 he devised a fully Lorentz-covariant perturbation theory for quantum fields . The approach proposed by Stueckelberg was very powerful , but was not adopted by others at the time , and has now been all but forgotten . However , besides being explicitly covariant , Stueckelberg 's methods avoid vacuum bubbles.Stueckelberg developed the vector boson exchange model as the theoretical explanation of the strong nuclear force in 1935 . Discussions with Pauli led Stueckelberg to drop the idea , however . It was rediscovered by Hideki Yukawa , who won a Nobel Prize for his work in 1949 — the first of several Nobel Prizes awarded for work which Stueckelberg contributed to , without recognition.In 1938 Stueckelberg recognized that massive electrodynamics contains a hidden scalar , and formulated an affine version of what would become known as the Abelian Higgs mechanism . He also proposed the law of conservation of baryon number.The evolution parameter theory he presented in 1941 and 1942 is the basis for recent work in relativistic dynamics .   
 In 1941 he proposed the interpretation of the positron as a positive energy electron traveling backward in time.In 1943 he came up with a renormalization program to attack the problems of infinities in quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) , but his paper was rejected by the Physical Review.In 1952 he proved the principle of semi-detailed balance for kinetics without microscopic reversibility.In 1953 he and the mathematician André Petermann discovered the renormalization group.In 1976 he was awarded the Max Planck medal.His PhD students included Marcel Guénin .

 = Samuel Barrett Miles =   
Samuel Barrett Miles ( 2 October 1838 – 28 August 1914 ) was a British Army officer who served as a diplomat in various Arabic-speaking countries , notably Oman , which he came to know better than any other European of the time . The notes that he made were published after his death as The Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf .   
    
    
 == Early years ==   
 Samuel Barrett Miles was born on 2 October 1838 , the son of Major-General Miles .   
 His father was in the military service of the East India Company .   
 Miles was educated at Harrow . He joined the British Indian Army in 1857 , the year of the Indian Mutiny . He entered the 7th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry as an ensign , was promoted to lieutenant in 1860 and became regimental quarter-master in 1864 . In November 1866 he moved with his regiment to Aden . The next year he was appointed Cantonment Magistrate and Assistant Resident at Aden .   
    
    
 == Political agent in the Gulf region ==   
 The regiment returned to India in March 1869 . Soon after , Miles applied for a transfer to the Political Service .   
 His first appointment was to Balochistan , where he stayed on the Makran coast .   
 Miles was appointed Political Agent and Consul at Muscat , in Oman , in October 1872 .   
 He spent most of his subsequent career as a political agent in Oman .   
 Other appointments included Political Agent in Turkish Arabia , Consul-General of Baghdad ( 1879 ) , Political Agent and Consul-General of Zanzibar ( 1881 ) , Political Agent in the North West Province and Oudh ( 1885 ) and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Miles came to Oman during the reign of Turki bin Said ( 1871–1888 ) , whom the British had assisted in ending the conservative religious revolution of Azzan bin Qais .   
 Miles made several journeys from Muscat into the interior of the country to gain a better understanding of the people for diplomatic purposes . He was an Arabist and Orientalist , and developed a deep knowledge of the history and the people of the region , recording his findings in copious notes .

 = Anna Gillingham =   
Anna Gillingham ( 1878–1963 ) was an educator and psychologist . Working with Dr. Samuel Orton , she trained teachers and published instructional materials regarding reading instruction , producing the Orton-Gillingham approach to reading instruction . With Bessie Stillman , she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual : Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading , Spelling and Penmanship . First published in 1935/6 , this work is updated and republished regularly . Along with the help of Stillman , Gillingham developed a “ sequential , alphabetic-phonetic multisensory program ” as a tool with which students could easily create meaningful syllables . This approach eliminated the need for a child to memorize almost all words in language , limiting it to those that were non-phonetic . This teaching manual for the “ alphabetic method ” of Orton ’ s theories combined multisensory techniques with teaching the structure of written English , including sounds ( phonemes ) , meaning units ( morphemes such as prefixes , suffixes , and roots ) and common spelling rules .   
 Anna Gillingham devoted her life to the maxim that in teaching , “ one should establish associations involving the simplest possible units and should use various reinforcement techniques ” to create solid association links . Alongside the practicing and development of her techniques , Gillingham began working with Dr. Henry Goddard – known for his adaptation and translation of the French Simon and Binet tests for use in determining superior intelligence , thus becoming the first school psychologist in the country .   
 After giving up her quest for a Ph.D. , Gillingham and Stillman set out on the methodical sorting of the English language . They sorted words that contain various single phonograms , digraphs and diphthongs , and those that follow particular patterns of syllable division . They developed spelling rules and exceptions , determined which spellings of vowel sounds occurred with the greatest frequency , and then developed procedures for mastering nonphonetic words . At the age of 69 Gillingham began work as a consultant for several schools in the country to supervise her remedial and preventative programs , train teachers for individual student teaching , and train classroom teachers .   
 To align her methods with the new editions of Webster 's Dictionary , which altered pronunciation of final syllables in many words and completely abandoned older rules of syllable division , Gillingham attempted ( at the age of 80 years ) to conform her work to the latest linguistic principles . Examples of the change in syllable division and final syllabic changes are as follows :   
    
 Another key aspect reinforced by Gillingham ’ s teaching career is her adherence to the theory that too early exposure to reading and writing may be harmful to children . The roots of her beliefs in this come from her own childhood , having spent the first ten years of her life on a Sioux Reservation in South Dakota . On her school experience Gillingham wrote , “ My parents believed in my having as wide general knowledge as possible before being introduced to the symbolism of written language…I believe that such postponement of reading and writing would be a great saving of the child ’ s and taxpayer ’ s money . ”

 = Karl Young (theatre historian) =   
Karl Young ( November 2 , 1879 – November 17 , 1943 ) was an American professor of English , medievalist , and theatre historian . Young 's theory of the liturgical origins of dramatic performance gained wide acceptance in the later twentieth century .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Young was born in Clinton , Iowa ; his father was lawyer and his grandfather a Presbyterian clergyman . He grew up in Ypsilanti , Michigan and graduated from high school there . He attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate and went on to get a Master 's Degree ( 1902 ) and doctorate ( 1907 ) at Harvard University . During his graduate studies , he taught at the Naval Academy in Annapolis for two years , then returned to Harvard to finish the doctorate . After taking his Ph.D. ( The Chaucer Society published his dissertation on Troilus and Criseyde in 1908 ) , he taught from 1908 to 1923 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison . The high point in his career were the two decades spent on the faculty at Yale University ( 1923–1943 ) . In 1933 , he became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . In 1940 , he was elected President of the Modern Language Association ; he received several honorary doctorates and prizes , among them the Gollancz Memorial Prize in 1941 .   
 Young 's research on what he called `` liturgical drama '' began with a publication in 1908 ; he relied heavily on Charles Magnin 's notion that modern European theatre performance originated in the Catholic Mass , in the Quem quaeritis Trope . This thesis , also propagated and widely disseminated by Léon Gautier , was brought to an even wider and anglophone audience through Young 's The Drama of the Medieval Church ( 1933 ) , which was reprinted several times and often taught at universities . Later scholars criticized Young 's model , claiming that it misunderstood the diverse and manifold liturgical culture of medieval Christianity , in which certain roles and tropes are legitimate elements of the liturgy and not necessarily self-conscious dramatic performance . Indeed , later generations re-examined notions of `` performance '' to such a degree , that Young 's theses became difficult to propagate.He died in New Haven , Connecticut ; a collection of his personal notes and scholarly files ( mostly concerning medieval liturgy ) is a part of the holdings at Yale University Music Library .

 = Ingeborg Beling =   
Ingeborg Beling was a German ethologist from the early 20th century who worked in the field of chronobiology . She studied at the University of Munich under the direction of Karl Von Frisch and is known for her research on the time sense of honey bees .   
 In her research , in 1929 , she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day , day after day . This contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees ’ 24-hour biological clock . Because of this achievement , she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists . Beyond honeybees , much of Beling ’ s work involved studying behaviors of wasps , fly pupae , etc . Finally , she also did some research in pest control .   
    
    
 == Bee-feeding experiment ( 1929 ) ==   
 Beling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper , titled `` Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen '' ( “ On the Time Memory of Bees ” ) published in the Journal of Comparative Physiology , that the early observations of Forel , v. Buttel-Reepen and Dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees , termed Zeitgedächtnis , or time memory . In her pioneer experiments , Beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish , which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day ( for example , between 4 and 6 PM ) . During the testing phase , the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded . She found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time , even when the sugar water was removed . Specifically , Beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning . Further more , she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day , and even for multiple times a day . However , Beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours , but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested . These results were still present when Beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity , temperature , light and radiation .   
    
    
 == Contributions to chronobiology ==   
 Beling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time . She found that this time memory is both rigorous ( the bees consistently show up at the expected time ) and flexible ( the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day , even two or three times a day ) . Beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours . This 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous , helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day . The bees ' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day , the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response . Beling ’ s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a Zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments .   
    
    
 == Related terms ==   
 Much of the early work in chronobiology was done in Germany , so publications were largely written in German . Some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today . The father of chronobiology , Colin Pittendrigh , critiqued these terms , saying that researchers in Munich have trouble letting go of these terms . He argues that ‘ training ’ and ‘ memory ’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior .   
    
    
 == Related chronobiologists ==   
 Beling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees . Her work grew from the observations of previous scientists ( Forel , Buttel-Reepen , von Frisch ) and helped inspire further experimentation ( Wahl , Renner ) . Standing on the shoulders of these researchers , Pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology .

 = Theodor Meynert =   
Theodor Hermann Meynert ( 15 June 1833 – 31 May 1892 ) was a German-Austrian psychiatrist , neuropathologist and anatomist born in Dresden . Meynert believed that disturbances in brain development could be a predisposition for psychiatric illness and that certain psychoses are reversible .   
 In 1861 he earned his medical doctorate , and in 1875 became director of the psychiatric clinic associated with the University of Vienna . Some of his better known students in Vienna were Josef Breuer , Sigmund Freud , who in 1883 worked at Meynert 's psychiatric clinic , and Julius Wagner-Jauregg , who introduced fever treatment for syphilis . Meynert later distanced himself from Freud because of the latter 's involvement with practices such as hypnosis . Meynert also ridiculed Freud 's idea of male hysteria ; though some authors believe this to be due to his own hidden suffering of the illness , prompting a reconciliation with Freud near to his death . Other famous students of Meynert 's were Russian neuropsychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff ( 1854–1900 ) , German neuropathologist Carl Wernicke ( 1848–1905 ) and Swiss neuroanatomist Auguste-Henri Forel ( 1848–1931 ) . Meynert 's work was an important influence in the career of German neuropathologist Paul Flechsig ( 1847–1929 ) .   
    
    
 == Brain research ==   
 Meynert 's work was largely focused on brain anatomy , pathology and histology , including the mapping of its intricate pathways and topography . He made many contributions involving the study of the cellular architecture of the brain and is often considered to be the founder of cerebral cortex cytoarchitectonics .   
 Meynert developed theories in regards to correlations between neuroanatomical and mental processes . He conceptualized that a coupling between one mental association and its temporal successor as a literal contact between cortical nerve cells linked to one other by nerve fibers , and a series of cortical associations could therefore be construed as being a `` train of thought '' . He also theorized that ideas and memories are to be envisioned as being attached to specific cortical cells .   
    
 In regards to mental illness , Meynert conceptualized that a conflict existed between the cerebral cortex and the sub-cortical regions as the primary cause for abnormal function of cerebral components . Also he formulated that a causal connection existed between cerebral pathologies and psychoses due to a lack of `` cerebral nutrition '' related to vasomotor functionality . Meynert 's aim was to establish psychiatry as an exact science based on anatomy . In his 1884 textbook Psychiatrie . Klinik der Erkrankungen des Vorderhirns , Meynert forewords with the statement : '' The reader will find no other definition of 'Psychiatry ' in this book but the one given on the title page : Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the Forebrain . The historical term for psychiatry , i.e. , 'treatment of the soul , ' implies more than we can accomplish , and transcends the bounds of accurate scientific investigation . ''   
    
    
 == Anatomical terms ==   
 He has several anatomical structures named after him , including the basal optic nucleus of Meynert , the substantia innominata of Meynert and `` Meynert cells '' , which are solitary pyramidal cells located in the cerebral cortex near the calcarine fissure . In 1869 Meynert described the dorsal tegmental decussation of the left and right tectospinal and tectobulbar tracts , located in the mesencephalon ( midbrain ) . This was to become known as `` Meynert 's decussation '' or as `` fountain decussation '' .

Stanislaus Josef Mathias von Prowazek , Edler von Lanow ( 12 November , 1875 Jindřichův Hradec , Bohemia – 17 February , 1915 , Cottbus ) , born Stanislav Provázek , was a Czech zoologist and parasitologist , who along with pathologist Henrique da Rocha Lima ( 1879-1956 ) discovered the pathogen of epidemic typhus .   
 As a student at the University of Prague , he was influenced by the teachings of zoologist Berthold Hatschek and philosopher Ernst Mach . Other important influences to his career were immunologist Paul Ehrlich at the Institute for Experimental Therapy in Frankfurt ( 1901 ) and zoologist Richard von Hertwig at the University of Munich.With radiologist Ludwig Halberstädter , he described the inclusion bodies ( Halberstädter-Prowazek bodies ) of Chlamydia trachomatis , the agent that is the cause of trachoma.In 1906 he succeeded his late friend , Fritz Schaudinn , as director of the zoological section at the Institut für Schiffs- und Tropenkrankheiten in Hamburg . In 1908 he conducted research at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz , outside of Rio de Janeiro , and from 1910 , carried out investigations of infectious diseases in Sumatra , German Samoa , Yap and Saipan.Prowazek studied epidemic typhus in Serbia ( 1913 ) and Istanbul ( 1914 ) . Later , while Prowazek and Rocha Lima were working in a German prison hospital , they both became infected with typhus . Prowazek died soon afterwards on February 17 , 1915 . Rocha Lima named the infectious agent of epidemic typhus - Rickettsia prowazekii - after his colleague .

Joseph Bruno Slowinski ( November 15 , 1962 – September 12 , 2001 ) was an American herpetologist who worked extensively with elapid snakes .   
    
    
 == Research and career ==   
 Slowinski was born on November 15 , 1962 in New York City , New York . He attained his bachelor 's degree in biology from the University of Kansas in 1984 and went on to receive his Ph.D. at the University of Miami in 1991 , studying under herpetologist Jay M. Savage . He performed postdoctoral work at the National Museum of Natural History and Louisiana State University , eventually taking a position as a professor of biology at Southeastern Louisiana University .   
 Slowinski was a founder of the first online herpetological journal , Contemporary Herpetology , and served as its editor-in-chief . He was also the curator for the Department of Herpetology for the California Academy of Sciences . His primary area of research was venomous snakes , having written some 40 peer-reviewed articles and one book .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 On September 11 , 2001 , while researching in an isolated region of Myanmar , Slowinski was bitten by a juvenile multi-banded krait ( Bungarus multicinctus ) . He died 29 hours later after his team , which included Mark W. Moffett , made several failed attempts to obtain medical attention . The weather that night was particularly bad , preventing a helicopter from transporting Slowinski to a hospital , and making it impossible to carry medical supplies to the campsite .   
 A biography of Slowinski titled The Snake Charmer was written in 2008 by Jamie James .   
 Three species have been named after Slowinski : a species of North American corn snake ( Pantherophis slowinskii ) , a species of bent-toed gecko native to Myanmar ( Cyrtodactylus slowinskii ) , and a species of krait native to Vietnam ( Bungarus slowinskii ) .

William Philip Spratling ( October 13 , 1863 in La Fayette , Alabama – December 22 , 1915 in Welaka , Florida ) was an American neurologist known for his advances in the treatment and study of epilepsy ; he is often described as the first American epileptologist — a word he is credited with having coined in his 1904 work Epilepsy and Its Treatment.Dr . Spratling was the superintendent of the Craig Colony for Epileptics in Sonyea , New York from 1893 to 1908 . He was co-founder and the first president of the National Association for the Study of Epilepsy . He was also the editor of the Proceedings of the Association between 1904 and 1912In his book `` Epilepsy and its Treatment '' published in 1904 he supported the theory of a cortical genesis of epileptic seizures earlier popularized by John Hughlings Jackson and William Richard Gowers , based on the animal studies of Gustav Fritsch , Eduard Hitzig , and David Ferrier .   
 In 1904 , Spratling was appointed superintendent of Bellevue Hospital Center ; however , due to civil service requirements , he did not actually hold the office.From 1911 to 1912 Spratling was a member of the Editorial Board of the journal `` Epilepsia '' of the International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE ) .   
 Later in life , Spratling suffered a nervous breakdown and retired to Florida . In 1915 , he died of a gunshot wound while hunting .

Roughly 2/3 of her 60 publications focused on order-disorder . The other publications dealt with structure determination of organic and inorganic crystals , methods development in single-crystal diffraction , and the development of equipment for this purpose .

 = Christian Ernst Stahl =   
Christian Ernst Stahl ( 21 June 1848 – 3 December 1919 ) was a German botanist who was a native of Schiltigheim , Alsace .   
    
    
 == Academic career ==   
 He studied botany at the University of Strasbourg with Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet ( 1838-1902 ) , and at the University of Halle under Anton de Bary ( 1831-1888 ) . He earned his doctorate in 1874 , and later became an assistant to Julius von Sachs ( 1832-1897 ) at the University of Würzburg . He was appointed an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg , and after just one year , he attained the chair of botany at the University of Jena in 1881 . Here , he also served as director of the botanical garden .   
 During the winter of 1889-1890 , he took a scientific expedition to Ceylon and Java , and in 1894 travelled to Mexico . Two of his better-known students were Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch ( 1867-1941 ) and Hans Kniep ( 1881-1930 ) .   
    
    
 == Botanical research ==   
 Stahl is remembered for his pioneer experiments in the field of ecophysiology , as well as research involving the developmental history of lichens . He was able to induce the synthesis of the lichen Endocarpon pusillum from spores and algal material , including formation of apothecia , and thus he made a strong experimental case for the hypothesis by Simon Schwendener ( 1829-1919 ) that lichens are twin fungal-algal organisms.Other contributions by Stahl included studies concerning the influence of light on plants — he described the anatomy of sun and shade leaves ; the effects of moisture and dryness on the formation of leaves , and the role of stomata in xerophytes and mesophytes . He conducted important research on the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and tree roots , and also worked on plant defense against snail and slug herbivory and a plethora of other botanical and ecological questions .

 = Raimundo Olabide =   
Raimundo Germán Olabide Karrera , S.J . ( 15 March 1869 - Toulouse 9 September 1942 ) was a Basque Jesuit priest , linguistic and translator . He authored a complete translation of the Bible into the Basque language .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Olabide was born in 1869 in Vitoria , Álava , Spain , to a couple who lived on the Plaza de la Virgen Blanca in the center of the city , where they ran a small business . Though both his parents were ethnically Basque , his mother had been born and raised in Madrid , and her native tongue was Castillian . As a result , he grow up speaking only that language . When he came of age , his parents sent him to the Jesuit college in Urduña.In 1884 , at the age of 15 , Olabide entered the Society of Jesus which operated the school . He then pursued his philosophical and theological studies at the Jesuit communities of Veruela Abbey and Tortosa . In the course as his formation with the Society , he worked as a teacher in Valladolid , Oña , Gijon and Salamanca . He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1902.It was while studying at the University of Salamanca in 1911 that Olabide came across a grammar book of Basque written by Arturo Campión , a leading proponent of Basque nationalism . It was then finally that , at the age of 27 , he began to learn his mother tongue , to the study and promotion of which he dedicated the rest of his life . The noted Basque lexographer who had published a classic dictionary of the language in 1904 , Resurrección María de Azkue , later commented that Olabide seemed to know his work better than he himself , the author , did .   
    
    
 == Translator ==   
 In 1914 Olabide published his first translation into that language , that of the noted Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola , in Basque Loyola'tar Eneko Deunaren Gogo-iñarkunak . Three years later , he published a complete dictionary of human anatomy Giza-soña ( The Human Body ) . His translations became noted for the purity of his language , as he refused to use loanwords from other languages . He was admitted to the Royal Academy of the Basque language in 1919 due to his contributions to the revival of the language .   
 The following year , Olabide published his translation into the Basque of the medieval spiritual classic , Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis , with the title of Kisto'ren antz-bidea . His goal had become the publishing of translations across the entire range of the sciences , so as to advance the use of the language .   
 Olabide , however , then made the decision to embark on a translation of the Bible . The New Testament took him ten years ; it was published in 1931 in Bilbao . After the expulsion of the Jesuits in the course of the Spanish Civil War , he took shelter at the Franciscan Sanctuary of Arantzazu in Oñati , where he devoted himself to the translation of the Old Testament . By chance , he was living in the city of Guernica on 26 April 1937 when the German Luftwaffe conducted its attack on the city . He was able to save his manuscripts from his residence before it was destroyed by fire and escaped to the nearby town of Kanala , where he was given refuge in the rectory of the town . He then left Spain and settled in Toulouse , France , where he died as the result of an accident on the streets of the city.The translation on which Olabide had been working at the town of his death was completed by a fellow Jesuit , Patxi Etxeberria , who was brought back from missionary service in Taiwan for this effort . It was published in 1958 .

 = William Sealy Gosset =   
William Sealy Gosset ( 13 June 1876 – 16 October 1937 ) was an English statistician , chemist and brewer who served as Head Brewer of Guinness and Head Experimental Brewer of Guinness and was a pioneer of modern statistics . He pioneered small sample experimental design and analysis with an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty . Gosset published under the pen name Student and developed most famously Student 's t-distribution – originally called Student 's `` z '' – and `` Student 's test of statistical significance '' .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Born in Canterbury , England the eldest son of Agnes Sealy Vidal and Colonel Frederic Gosset , R.E . Royal Engineers , Gosset attended Winchester College before matriculating as Winchester Scholar in natural sciences and mathematics at New College , Oxford . Upon graduating in 1899 , he joined the brewery of Arthur Guinness & Son in Dublin , Ireland , where he would spend the rest of his 38-year careerIn his job as Head Experimental Brewer at Guinness , the self-trained Gosset developed new statistical methods – both in the brewery and on the farm – now central to the design of experiments , to proper use of significance testing on repeated trials , and to analysis of economic significance ( an early instance of decision theory interpretation of statistics ) and more , such as his small-sample , stratified , and repeated balanced experiments on barley for proving the best yielding varieties . Gosset acquired that knowledge by study , by trial and error , by cooperating with others , and by spending two terms in 1906–1907 in the Biometrics laboratory of Karl Pearson . Gosset and Pearson had a good relationship . Pearson helped Gosset with the mathematics of his papers , including the 1908 papers , but had little appreciation of their importance . The papers addressed the brewer 's concern with small samples ; biometricians like Pearson , on the other hand , typically had hundreds of observations and saw no urgency in developing small-sample methods.Gosset 's first publication came in 1907 , `` On the Error of Counting with a Haemacytometer , '' in which – unbeknownst to Gosset aka `` Student '' – he rediscovered the Poisson distribution . Another researcher at Guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the Guinness brewery . The economic historian Stephen Ziliak discovered in the Guinness Archives that to prevent further disclosure of confidential information , the Guinness Board of Directors allowed its scientists to publish research on condition that they do not mention `` 1 ) beer , 2 ) Guinness , or 3 ) their own surname '' . to Ziliak , Gosset seems to have gotten his pen name `` Student '' from his 1906–1907 notebook on counting yeast cells with a haemacytometer , `` The Student 's Science Notebook '' Thus his most noteworthy achievement is now called Student 's , rather than Gosset 's , t-distribution and test of statistical significance .   
    
 Gosset published most of his 21 academic papers , including The probable error of a mean , in Pearson 's journal Biometrika under the pseudonym Student . It was , however , not Pearson but Ronald A. Fisher who appreciated the understudied importance of Gosset 's small-sample work . Fisher wrote to Gosset in 1912 explaining that Student 's z-distribution should be divided by degrees of freedom not total sample size . From 1912 to 1934 Gosset and Fisher would exchange more than 150 letters . In 1924 , Gosset wrote in a letter to Fisher , `` I am sending you a copy of Student 's Tables as you are the only man that 's ever likely to use them ! '' Fisher believed that Gosset had effected a `` logical revolution '' . In a special issue of Metron in 1925 Student published the corrected tables , now called Student 's t

 = George Young (Presbyterian minister) =   
George Young ( 15 July 1777 – 8 May 1848 ) was a Scottish divine , scholar and flood geologist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 George Young was born in Kirknewton south-west of Edinburgh to John Young and his wife Jean . George was born without a left hand and this situation led his parents to educate him for the ministry.At the University of Edinburgh he distinguished himself in mathematics and natural philosophy . He was a favorite student of Professor John Playfair who was , at that time , becoming the great promoter of James Hutton 's uniformitarian geology . After receiving high honors upon completion of his degree in 1796 , he studied theology under Dr George Lawson at Selkirk for five years , receiving at the end of this period a licence to preach from the Presbytery of Glasgow . In 1806 he became the pastor of the Cliff Street chapel in Whitby where he served for 42 years . He obtained an M.A . degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1819 . In 1826 he married Margaret Hunter . Though married for 20 years they had no children .   
 Young could read and write Hebrew , Greek , Latin , French , and Italian with some acquaintance with Arabic , Chaldean and Syriac , and he developed his own shorthand , which is still undecipherable . He helped establish Whitby Museum as the first secretary and a founding member of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society . He procured fossil and mineral collections for the Yorkshire Philosophical Society .   
 Young wrote twenty-two books on many topics : inter alia , the history of Whitby ; the great solar eclipse of 1836 ; an acclaimed biography of Captain James Cook ; the downfall of Napoleon ; and , a catalog of hardy garden plants .   
 With John Bird as artist he wrote A Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast in 1822 published in Whitby . This book remains in print in facsimile . A second edition ( 1828 ) was printed and published in the north of England , Edinburgh , and London . The second edition contains seventeen plates : numbers one to fifteen , and number seventeen , are on one page , and number sixteen is a two-page spread . The plates are hand-coloured with watercolour : brush-strokes are clearly visible . The effect is exquisite and may reflect Young 's passion for geology , and Bird 's art.The title was followed by Scriptural Geology in 1838 .   
 George Young was immersed in fossil collecting and selling . He helped preserve preserving the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and museum . He promoted fossil collecting saying , `` The researches of the geologist are far from being unworthy of the Christian , or the philosopher : for , while they enlarge the bounds of our knowledge , and present a wide field for intellectual employment and innocent pleasure , they may serve to conduct us to the glorious Being . '' R.J. Cleevely stated that Young `` questioned many of the facts concerning fossils , sedimentation and geological time ” of the Yorkshire coast , such as the facts that the strata had been deposited by water , and that the horizontally deposited strata had become tilted by some violent force . Young did not object to these facts , but to interpretations of them by contemporary geologists.On 8 May 1848 , two years after the death of his wife , George Young died of influenza at the age of 71 years .

 = Beno Gutenberg =   
Beno Gutenberg ( ; June 4 , 1889 – January 25 , 1960 ) was a German-American seismologist who made several important contributions to the science . He was a colleague and mentor of Charles Francis Richter at the California Institute of Technology and Richter 's collaborator in developing the Richter magnitude scale for measuring an earthquake 's magnitude .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Gutenberg was born in Darmstadt , Germany , and obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in 1911 . His advisor was Emil Wiechert . During World War I , Gutenberg served in the German army as a meteorologist in support of gas warfare operations.Gutenberg held positions at the University of Strasbourg , which he lost when Strasbourg became French in 1918 . After some years during which he had to sustain himself with managing his father 's soap factory , he obtained in 1926 a junior professorship at University of Frankfurt-am-Main , which was poorly paid .   
 Although he was already , in the 1920s , one of the leading seismologists worldwide and definitely the leading seismologist in Germany , he was still dependent on the position in his father 's factory ; however , he continued his research in his spare time .   
    
    
 == Professor ==   
 In 1928 , the attempt to become the successor of his academic teacher , Emil Wiechert , in Göttingen , failed . There are hints that Gutenberg 's Jewish background might have played a role because , already in the 1920s , there were strong antisemitic tendencies in German universities . For similar reasons , he was also not accepted for a professorship in Potsdam to become the successor of Gustav Angenheister .   
 Since Gutenberg could not sustain a career of scientific work in Germany , he accepted a position as Professor of Geophysics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena in 1930 , becoming founding director of the Seismological Laboratory when it was transferred to Caltech from Carnegie . Even if he had obtained a full professorship in Germany , he would have lost it in 1933 anyway like so many other scientists of Jewish ancestry , at least 30 of whom emigrated to the United States under Gutenberg 's sponsorship .   
    
    
 == Research ==   
 Gutenberg , especially in his collaboration with Charles Francis Richter , made the California Institute of Technology Seismological Laboratory the leading seismological institute worldwide . Collaborating with Richter , Gutenberg developed a relationship between seismic magnitude and energy , represented in this equation :

 = J. A. O. Preus II =   
Jacob Aall Ottesen Preus II ( January 8 , 1920 , Saint Paul , Minnesota – August 13 , 1994 ) was a Lutheran pastor , professor , author , seminary president and church denominational president . He served as the eighth president of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod ( LCMS ) from 1969 to 1981 . He was a major figure in the `` Seminex '' theological/political controversy , which resulted in a schism in the LCMS during the early 1970s .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Preus was born on January 8 , 1920 , in Saint Paul , Minnesota . He attended Luther Theological Seminary in Minneapolis , Minnesota , graduating in 1945 . While in school he married Delpha Mae Holleque on June 12 , 1943 . He was ordained a pastor and served several congregations in Minnesota . He received a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1951.In 1958 , he moved to Concordia Theological Seminary , then in Springfield , Illinois as a professor . He became the president of the seminary in 1962.In 1969 , Preus was elected president of the LCMS , upsetting the incumbent , Oliver R. Harms . Preus represented a theologically more conservative wing of the LCMS , and his administration worked to reverse the policies of the more moderate administration preceding his.In 1973-74 , a battle over teachings at the LCMS 's flagship seminary , Concordia Seminary in St. Louis , resulted in the suspension of the president of the seminary , John Tietjen , and the walkout of most of seminary 's professors and students to form a rival seminary known as Concordia Seminary-in-Exile or Seminex . This resulted in a schism in the LCMS , with a small group eventually leaving the synod to form the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in 1976 . The AELC served as a catalyst for the merger of the moderate and liberal Lutheran churches in the United States into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1988.Preus was named President Emeritus of the LCMS in 1992 . He died in Burnsville , Minnesota on August 13 , 1994 .   
    
    
 == Scholarship ==   
 Preus was known as a scholar of the Orthodoxy period of Lutheran history , especially of Lutheran Protestant theologian Martin Chemnitz ( 1522-1586 ) .

 = Spiros Zodhiates =   
Spiros Zodhiates ( Greek : Σπύρος Ζωδιάτης ; March 13 , 1922 – October 10 , 2009 ) was a Greek-American Bible scholar , author , and ministry innovator . He was best known for his work in developing AMG ( Advancing the Ministries of the Gospel ) International , a Christian missions and relief agency with operations in over 40 countries , and for publishing The Hebrew-Greek KeyWord Study Bible which indexes key terms in the English Bible with the words they were translated from in the original languages .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Zodhiates was born of Greek parents on the island of Cyprus . His father first brought the family to Port Said , Egypt and then Khartoum , Sudan , looking for work . Spiros 's brother , Argos Zodhiates , was converted to Protestant Christianity after hearing an evangelical preacher and brought this witness to his mother and brother , who also became convinced of its truth . After neglecting to kiss a Greek Orthodox priest 's hand , Zodhiates was expelled from school . A lady named Katherine took pity on him and volunteered to teach the boy English .   
 After completing his Greek education , he attended the American University in Cairo , Egypt , received his Th.B . degree from the National Bible Institute ( later Shelton College , which closed its doors in 1990 ) in New York City , and his M.A . from New York University . In 1978 he earned his Doctor of Theology degree from Luther Rice Seminary of Jacksonville , Florida . He was also the recipient of several honorary doctorates .   
 He came to the United States in 1946 at the invitation of the American Committee for the Evangelization of the Greeks ( now AMG International ) , of which he became president in 1966 . Under Zodhiates ' leadership , AMG grew from a small ministry focusing on the land of Greece to a worldwide evangelistic and relief ministry . AMG , founded in 1943 in New York City and presently located in Chattanooga , Tennessee , provides a wide range of social services , including care for orphans and leprosy patients , and has an expanding evangelistic thrust of “ Advertising the Message of the Gospel ” through paid newspaper and magazine gospel messages in many lands and languages .   
 In 1951 , Zodhiates ’ passion for radio was born when he realized the power of media to get the message of Christianity to the masses . Using his Greek background and knowledge of the Greek language as a springboard , Zodhiates took to the airwaves , teaching the New Testament in light of the original Greek meaning of the words used . Zodhiates ’ program , New Testament Light , began on one station in rural Pennsylvania , and in its heyday was heard across the United States and Canada . As his career progressed , Zodhiates became a recognized authority on the Greek New Testament . His Bible teaching carried from radio into other media as well . In 1975 , he launched Pulpit Helps Magazine , a monthly publication designed to provide pastors with insights from the original languages of the Bible , tips on sermon construction , illustrative stories to enhance Bible teaching , and news from Christian missions around the world . Pulpit Helps still serves thousands of readers in the United States and other English-speaking countries . New Testament Light was developed into a television show during the 1980s and was broadcast on numerous stations through the mid-1990s .   
    
    
 == Books ==   
 In addition to The Hebrew-Greek KeyWord Study Bible , Zodhiates published over 200 books and booklets in English , as well as 82 in Greek , many of which are in-depth word-by-word commentaries on the books of the New Testament . He started a book house , AMG Publishers , which has since grown into a significant producer of Christian books , to publish much of his material . He was also responsible for introducing the Modern Greek pronunciation of Classical and Koine Greek into U.S. colleges and universities through A Guide to Modern Greek Pronunciation and his tape recordings of the entire Koine New Testament ( Nestle 's text ) in Modern Greek pronunciation . He recorded with Modern Greek pronunciation special courses on New Testament Greek for those who wish to learn it on their own or in classrooms , using texts such as J. Gresham Machen 's New Testament Greek for Beginners , Summers ' , Davis ' , and Hadjiantoniou 's grammars .   
 After suffering numerous health problems in the late 1990s , Zodhiates transitioned out of active work , though many of his commentary manuscripts are still being edited and published , and his radio and television recordings are being redistributed digitally . He died in Chattanooga on October 10 , 2009 .

 = Marcello Pirani =   
Marcello Stefano Pirani ( July 1 , 1880 – January 11 , 1968 ) was a German physicist known for his invention of the Pirani vacuum gauge , a vacuum gauge based on the principle of heat loss measurement . Throughout his career , he worked on advancing lighting technology and pioneered work on the physics of gas discharge .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Marcello Pirani was born on July 1 , 1880 , in Berlin . Starting in 1899 , he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Berlin . In 1903 , he was granted a PhD for his measurements of the dielectric constant of solids in the group of Emil Warburg . He then moved to the Technical University of Aachen as an assistant at the Physikalischen Institut of this University .   
 In 1904 , he joined the light bulb factory ( Glühlampenwerk ) of Siemens & Halske AG in Berlin where he remained for the next fifteen years . At the age of 25 , in 1905 , he was promoted head of the development lab of the light bulb factory .   
 In 1906 , he made his most important invention with the development of a new type of vacuum gauge that today bears his name , the Pirani gauge . It is based on measuring the pressure dependence of heat loss from a hot wire by heat transfer to the surrounding gas and walls . In particular , it employs the change in resistivity of the heated wire ( in Pirani ’ s original work consisting of Tantalum and Platinum , today , Tungsten , Platinum or Nickel is commonly used ) with temperature to determine the heat loss . Its useful measurement range lies within 10−4mbar up to 1000mbar .   
 Four years later , he finished his habilitation on optical measurements of high temperatures and studies on the relationship between temperature and emissivity of hot solids and becomes private docent at the Technical University Berlin-Charlottenburg . During the first world war , he enlisted in the army to deal with scientific-technical problems such as wireless telegraphy .   
 In 1918 , Pirani was promoted Titular-Professor at the TU Berlin-Charlottenburg . One year later , he co-founded the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Metallkunde ( German society for metal science ) in Berlin .   
 From 1919 to 1936 , he worked for the newly formed Osram company . As head of the scientific-technical bureau , he was in charge of coordinating and pushing scientific work in the field of light bulbs of the three founding companies Siemens & Halske , AEG and the Auergesellschaft . In this time fall his pioneering contributions to the advancement of lighting technology , in particular in the field of gas-discharge lamps : In 1922 , he was named außerordentlicher Professor at the TU Berlin . In 1928 , he became head of the Studiengesellschaft for electrical lighting of the Osram GmbH . He wrote a textbook on heat generation from electrical sources in 1930 .   
 As his mother — Clara Schönlank — was Jewish , with the rise of the Nazi Party to power in Germany he left Germany in 1936 for England and joined the research lab of General Electric Co. Ltd. in Wembley . There his work focused on gas discharge lamps and high temperature resistant materials . From 1941 to 1947 , he served as scientific consultant for the British Coal Utilization Research Association in London , working on new high temperature resistant materials involving carbon . Between 1947 and 1952 , he was scientific consultant for the British-American Research Ltd. , also in London .   
 In 1953 , he returned to Germany as one of the few second world war repatriates with scientific background and moved first to Munich and from 1955 to his hometown Berlin . In 1954 , he took up a consultant position with Osram working on problems in gas discharge , glass and ceramics up to an old age .   
 On January 11 , 1968 , Marcello Pirani died in Berlin .

 = Maximilien Chaudoir =   
Maximilien Chaudoir , or Maximilien , baron de Chaudoir , ( 12 September 1816 , Ivnitsa , near Zhitomir – 6 May 1881 , Amélie-les-Bains ) was a Russian entomologist . He was a specialist in Coleoptera and in particular the Carabidae . His Cicindelidae are conserved by the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris . His Carabidae were acquired by Charles Oberthür ( 1845-1924 ) , then given to the same museum . He wrote Mémoire sur la famille des Carabiques , 6 volumes commencing 1848 .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Chaudoir was born in Ivnitza , about 30 kilometres from Jitomir , Ukraine . The family may come from a line of French Protestant emigrants who fled in 1685 or from Belgium . The subsequent roots have been traced to Antoine de Chaudoire from Poland whose son worked in the court of Stanislas-Auguste Poniatowski until his abdication in 1795 after which he moved to Bavaria where he received the hereditary title of Baron from Maximilien Joseph II in 1814 . His son Stanislav ( 1790-1858 ) married Aglae d'Erggelet and Maximilien was their only son . Stanislav was a wealthy collector who donated his books and collectibles to the Hermitage Museum . Maximilien was raised by his aunt as his mother died after his birth . Jean Wavre , a private tutor introduced him to natural history and insects . He began collecting carabid beetles in 1826 . He was sent to study law at Tartu ( Dorpat ) , although not interested in law , he knew that J.F . Eschscholtz taught zoology there . Unfortunately for him , Eschscholtz died a few weeks before he joined the university , and Chaudoir began to work on his collections at the museum . He was encouraged by Count Gustave de Mannerheim and in 1834 he travelled around Germany and met Louis Chevrolat in Hamburg . He became a member of the Entomological Society of France in 1834 . He moved to Kiev and then joined the Societe Imperiale des Naturlistes de Moscou in 1837 . In 1845 Chaudoir visited Crimea and became interested in the Caucasus region . In 1847 he became a member of the Entomologische Verein , Stettin . In 1848 he bought the Faldermann collection followed by another collection of Himalayan beetles from Captain Boys in 1850 and still later Gory 's collection in 1852.He married Elisabeth-Augusta Bockshanine on February 28 , 1856 . They had a daughter and a son . His daughter Marie however died in 1879 at the age of 22 from Tuberculosis . Chaudoir died from a stroke on 6 May 1881 and was buried next to his daughter in their family vault at Amelie-Bains-Palalda . His wife died in 1896 at Jitomir and their son died without issue in 1919 . Before his death he let his collection be available to Rene Oberthür through his friend Charles Oberthür . This collection eventually went to the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris .

In aerial combat over China and the Pacific , he was officially credited with destroying 27 enemy aircraft .   
 Akamatsu was known as a troublemaker and trickster . Many of his air victories were obtained while drunk . Despite this , his supervisors stood behind him , as did his fellow pilots who frequently defended and covered for him . Henry Sakaida confirmed that Akamatsu flew for more than 8,000 flight hours . At the end of the war , Akamatsu flew the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden fighter.Akamatsu was credited with shooting down 11 enemy aircraft over China in the Second Sino-Japanese War , including four in a single engagement near Nanchang on 25 February 1938 . In the opening months of the Pacific War , he served in the Philippines and Dutch East Indies campaigns . From January 1944 until the end of the war , Akamatsu flew out of Atsugi Air Base , defending Tokyo from Allied air attacks .   
 After the war , Akamatsu worked as a fish search pilot for the Kōchi Fishery Association and later ran a small cafe in Kōchi . After struggling for years with alcoholism , Akamatsu died of pneumonia on 22 February 1980 .

 where ε is the depth of the potential well , σ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero , r is the distance between the particles , and rm is the distance at which the potential reaches its minimum . At rm , the potential function has the value −ε . The distances are related as rm = 21/6σ ≈ 1.122σ . These parameters can be fitted to reproduce experimental data or accurate quantum chemistry calculations . Due to its computational simplicity , the Lennard-Jones potential is used extensively in computer simulations even though more accurate potentials exist .   
    
    
 == Explanation ==   
 The r−12 term , which is the repulsive term , describes Pauli repulsion at short ranges due to overlapping electron orbitals , and the r−6 term , which is the attractive long-range term , describes attraction at long ranges ( van der Waals force , or dispersion force ) .   
 Differentiating the L-J potential with respect to r gives an expression for the net inter-molecular force between 2 molecules . This inter-molecular force may be attractive or repulsive , depending on the value of r. When r is very small , the molecules repel each other .   
 Whereas the functional form of the attractive term has a clear physical justification , the repulsive term has no theoretical justification . It is used because it approximates the Pauli repulsion well and is more convenient due to the relative computing efficiency of calculating r12 as the square of r6 .   
 The L-J potential is a relatively good approximation . Due to its simplicity , it is often used to describe the properties of gases and to model dispersion and overlap interactions in molecular models . It is especially accurate for noble gas atoms and is a good approximation at long and short distances for neutral atoms and molecules .   
 The lowest-energy arrangement of an infinite number of atoms described by a Lennard-Jones potential is a hexagonal close-packing . On raising temperature , the lowest-free-energy arrangement becomes cubic close packing , and then liquid . Under pressure , the lowest-energy structure switches between cubic and hexagonal close packing . Real materials include body-centered cubic structures also.The Lennard-Jones ( 12,6 ) potential was improved by the Buckingham potential ( exp-6 ) later proposed by Richard Buckingham , incorporating an extra parameter and the repulsive part is replaced by an exponential function :

 = Frederic Vester =   
Frederic Vester ( November 23 , 1925 – November 2 , 2003 ) was a German biochemist , and an expert in the field of ecology .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Vester was born in Saarbrücken , and studied chemistry at the universities of Mainz , Paris and Hamburg . From 1955 to 1957 he was postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and Cambridge . From 1957 to 1966 he worked at Saarland University , Saarbrücken , and from 1969 he worked in Munich , first at the Max Planck Institute . In 1970 he founded the private Munich-based Frederic Vester Studiengruppe für Biologie und Umwelt GmbH ( `` Frederic Vester Study Group for Biology and Environment , Ltd. ) , renamed Frederic Vester GmbH ( `` Frederic Vester , Ltd. '' ) after his death .   
 From 1982 to 1989 he was a professor at the Bundeswehr University Munich , and from 1989 to 1991 he was Professor for Applied Economics at the Hochschule St. Gallen , Switzerland .

 === Networked Thinking ===   
 Vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking , a combination of cybernetic and systemic ideas and complexity . Central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects , leading to emergent behavior of the system as a whole . These networks can be described by using protocols , mathematical networks , computer software , so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations , including positive and negative feedback loops . Simulations of systemic networks can help to decide the long-term effects of singular measures .   
    
    
 === The Sensitivity Model ===   
 Vester 's Sensitivity Model combines these ideas , and has been used since the 1980s in studies by Ford , UNESCO and other organizations .

Berthold Hatschek ( 3 April 1854 – 18 January 1941 ) was an Austrian zoologist remembered for embryological and morphological studies of invertebrates .   
 He studied zoology in Vienna under Carl Claus ( 1835-1899 ) , and in Leipzig with Rudolf Leuckart ( 1822-1898 ) . He gained his doctorate at the University of Leipzig with a dissertation titled Beiträge zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Lepidopteren . Hatschek was deeply influenced by the works of Ernst Haeckel ( 1834-1919 ) .   
 In 1885 he was appointed professor of zoology at Charles University in Prague , and from 1896 was a professor and director of the second zoological institute at the University of Vienna . Hatschek suffered from severe depression , which greatly affected his work in the latter stages of his life.Hatschek is remembered for the so-called `` trochophore theory '' , in which he explains the trochophore to be the larval form of a hypothetical organism- the `` trochozoon '' ( which in adult form corresponded to a trochophore-like rotifer , and was the suggested common ancestor of almost all bilateral , metazoan lifeforms ) .In 1888 he split Frey and Leuckart 's Coelenterata into three phyla : Spongiaria , Cnidaria and Ctenophora . From his research of amphioxus , the anatomical terms- `` Hatschek 's pit '' and `` Hatschek 's nephridium '' are derived .

Enrico Barone ( Italian : [ baˈroːne ] ; 22 December 1859 , Naples , Kingdom of the Two Sicilies – 14 May 1924 , Rome , Italy ) was a soldier , military historian , and an economist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Barone studied the classics and mathematics before becoming an army officer . He taught military history for eight years from 1894 at the Officers ' Training School . There he wrote a series of influential historical military works . In these he employed a method of successive approximations to which his study in economics had introduced him . In 1902 , he became head of the historical office of the General Staff . He resigned his commission in 1906 .   
 From 1894 he collaborated with Maffeo Pantaleoni and Vilfredo Pareto in the Giornale degli Economisti .   
    
    
 == Impact ==   
 He was the first to state conditions under which a competitive market would be Pareto efficient . He introduced variable factor proportions into neoclassical economics , contributing to the marginal-productivity theory of factor-income distribution . He extended conditions of general equilibrium in Walrasian theory , suggesting the feasibility of trial-and-error movement to market equilibrium . He pioneered the economic theory of index numbers . His contributions were made without use of utility or even indifference curves .   
    
 Barone has been described as a `` founder of the pure theory of a socialist economy . '' In 1908 , he presented a mathematical model for a socialist economy under which certain relations , later identified with shadow prices , must be satisfied for `` maximum collective welfare . '' The latter corresponds to least-cost-price of production from Pareto efficiency reached in competitive equilibrium . He stressed that such a result could not be arrived at a priori but only by experimentation on a large scale with great demands on data collection , even assuming unchanging productive conditions . In this , he suggested that movement toward economic efficiency in a socialist economy was not inconceivable , outlining two types of socialism : a centralized and decentralized model . For such regimes , whatever the distribution rule for output and income adopted by the Ministry of Production , the same economic categories would reappear for prices , salaries , interest , rent , profits , saving , etc. , though perhaps with different names . His analysis , and the Austrian Economists ' responses , fueled discussion of the economic calculation problem and market socialism in the 1930s . His method also anticipated Abram Bergson 's seminal formulation of a social welfare function three decades later .

Sir James Ramsay-Gibson-Maitland , 4th Baronet ( 29 March 1848 – 9 November 1897 ) was a Scottish aquaculturist who dedicated his life to experimenting on the practices of husbandry in fish . He gained recognition for his work by being awarded several diplomas .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 James Maitland was born on 29 March 1848 , his father was Sir Alexander Ramsay-Gibson-Maitland of Clifton Hall , and his mother was Thomasina Maitland ( née Hunt ) , and two brothers William and Keith . Sir Anthony was a descendant of the Earl of Lauderdale ; however , it was through his father 's marriage to Susan Ramsay that he inherited the Ramsay title and lands , as all other male descendants were deceased . Sir Anthony became the 3rd Baronet of Barnton , Sauchie and Bannockburn.James was educated at St Andrews University before leaving to attend the Royal Military College at Sandhurst ; however , after joining the army and becoming a Captain in the Highland Borderers , he left after one year . He married Fanny White , daughter of Sir Thomas Woollaston White , 2nd Baronet of Tuxford and Wallingwells in 1869 , near Nottingham , and they moved to Craigend in 1873 . James and Fanny had two daughters .   
    
    
 == Howietoun Fishery ==   
 Howietoun Fishery was established in 1873 , Maitland had previously been experimenting in another site ; however , the site was prone to flooding which meant that Maitland and a team of men had to try and recapture the escaped Swiss trout . Howietoun was an ideal spot as it had a water supply from Lake Coulter and a steady supply of spring water also.Maitland believed that fish could be raised in a similar way as farm animals , in that animal husbandry could also be successful when applied to a fishery . Maitland 's approach to experimentation was a scientific one ; he would only change one variable during an experiment and then would hypothesise how the outcome had happened . This meant that he was able to work out that breeding young stock of fish gave a result of weak offspring ; instead , he realised older stock must be used to gain strong offspring . He worked out that the female fish must be stripped of their eggs and male milt collected in October ; he then worked on hatching boxes for the live ova . After the fry hatched , then they were transferred to rearing boxes before being transferred to plank ponds . Maitland was meticulous in writing up his experiments ; this means that every change that he made in the diet , transport and selective breeding of the fish was documented . There are even pictures with measurements of the instruments Maitland was inventing to make rearing fish easier.Maitland also experimented on the diet of the trout and salmon at the fishery ; he worked out that horse spleen when ingested by trout caused blindness and nutritional cataracts . He worked on several options before concluding that the best option for feeding trout and salmon was horsemeat , shellfish and eggs.One of his most important experiments was finding ways to transport large quantities of live ova , at the time live ova were sent in crammed packages and when they arrived most did not survive , Maitland took three attempts to work out how to insulate the cargo to stop fluctuations in temperature . Successful shipments were then sent to Wellington , Dunedin and Otago in the specially designed shipment boxes that Maitland had designed himself .   
    
    
 === Awards ===   
 The work of Maitland at Howietoun fishery meant that he was awarded several diplomas in fish culture and two gold medals in 1883 and 1885 , at the International Fisheries Exhibitions , Edinburgh .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 Maitland died on 9 November 1897 , his daughter Mary Steel-Maitland and her husband Arthur Steel-Maitland took over the running of Howietoun . Howietoun Fishery was then amalgamated into the Northern Fisheries Company in 1914 before the Maitland family sold it in 1969 . It became a part of the University of Stirling Aquaculture Institute in 1979.The majority of brown trout re-stocking in Scotland is achieved through the stock of Howietoun Fishery .

 = James Smith (Scottish botanist) =   
James Smith ( 1763 – 1 January 1848 ) was a Scottish botanist . He founded the Monkwood Botanic Garden and Nursery ; which contained a collection of about 2000 rare and exotic plants .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Smith was born in Ayrshire , Scotland . He is known for his contributions to the field of botany . Not to be confused with James Edward Smith , Smith was regularly consulted by famed botanical illustrator William Hooker about different species of plants . Smith would gather rare plants from many places to create what was said to be one of the prettiest gardens in Scotland at the time . He loved his plants so much that he could n't bear to destroy any of them and it is said that once when he was compelled to chop down a tree which had grown so large that its shadow threatened other plants , he shut his eyes and hacked at the tree until it fell .   
    
    
 == Death ==   
    
 Smith died on 1 January 1848 , aged 84 . His tombstone in Ayr Auld Kirkyard described him as `` the father of Scottish botany '' . By the end of the century both the house and garden at Monkwood Grove had gone but it remained a favorite place for Sunday afternoon walks and occasionally we were rewarded with a sight of one of Smith 's rare flowers surviving among the tangle of brambles and wild plants . Monkwood Grove was so remote that a little house which stood on the Dalrymple bank of the river was known as Fin ' Me Oot . Although Fin ' Me Oot cottage has gone too , the two fields on Monkwood Mains land beside the river are known as the Fin ' Me Oot holms .   
 Smith 's daughter Margaret married well known botanist and author John Goldie , making him Goldie 's father in-law .

 = Howard Penman =   
Howard Latimer Penman ( 1909-1984 ) was a British meteorologist . He formulated Penman ’ s Formula which is used worldwide by meteorologists and agricultural scientists to assess evaporation rates in different setups ( lakes and ponds , lawns , cropped fields ) and locations in the world . With John Monteith he formulated the Penman–Monteith equation which is used to calculate evapotranspiration and the need for crop irrigation . Penman was a distinguished Rothamsted Research scientist and government advisor , and a well-known local figure in Harpenden .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Howard Penman was born in County Durham and studied at Durham University where he graduated in Physics in 1930 . While working for the British Cotton Research Association in Manchester he worked on his thesis for his Ph.D. , which was awarded by Durham University in 1938 . Bored by the work on cotton dyes he applied in 1937 for a post in the Soil Physics Department at Rothamsted Research , headed by Bernard Keen , for a salary of £320 per annum . He became interested in the records of the drain gauges , and their relationship with rainfall , and from these was able to estimate the rate at which water evaporated from bare soil . From these beginnings some of his major contributions would follow . When war broke out he was recruited by the Admiralty and worked on the sound output of ships and submarines in connection with the development of acoustic mines . In 1944 he was recalled to Rothamsted to work on the physics of wet soil in preparation for the land campaign , where the progress of military vehicles would be vital .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After the war he continued work on water-related topics , including irrigation needs worldwide , and seasonal water balances for each catchment area in Britain . R.K. Schofield succeeded Bernard Keen in 1947 , but in 1954 Schofield became head of the Chemistry Department and Penman was appointed head of the separate Physics Department . Several members of his staff were involved in meteorological projects in Africa , and scientists came to be trained before taking posts in Nigeria , Kenya and Uganda and elsewhere , working on the needs of tropical crops . In 1961 he served as President of the Royal Meteorological Society , and he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1965 . He served on many academic and government bodies , and travelled widely , advising on reservoir projects and water needs , and was awarded the O.B.E . He retired from Rothamsted in 1974 , but continued to take an interest in scientific and international issues until his death in 1984 .   
    
    
 == Writings ==   
 Besides his work Penman also used to write humorous and satirical sketches . As a person he had a keen intellect and questioning temperament , but a fine sense of humour which showed itself in many ways , such as at the Christmas pantomimes at Rothamsted where he wrote some of the satirical sketches .   
    
    
 == Contribution ==   
 With his wife Nan he was very much involved with the United Nations Association and the need for international cooperation to solve the long term problems of peace and development . John Monteith in his Royal Society obituary article wrote : “ By showing how classical physics can be used to solve environmental problems , Howard Penman made a unique contribution to agricultural meteorology and hydrology . His finest memorial is the formula which bears his name . ”

He became actively engaged in the software design of Multics ( Multiplexed Information and Computing Service ) , a general-purpose operating system used at Bell .   
    
    
 == Education and career ==   
 Ossanna received his Bachelor of Engineering ( B.S.E.E . ) from Wayne State University in 1952.At Bell Telephone Labs , Ossanna was concerned with low-noise amplifier design , feedback amplifier design , satellite look-angle prediction , mobile radio fading theory , and statistical data processing . He was also concerned with the operation of the Murray Hill Computation Center and was actively engaged in the software design of Multics.After learning how to program the PDP-7 computer , Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , Joe Ossanna , and Rudd Canaday began to program the operating system that was designed earlier by Thompson ( Unics , later named Unix ) . After writing the file system and a set of basic utilities , and assembler , a core of the Unix operating system was established . Doug McIlroy later wrote , `` Ossanna , with the instincts of a motor pool sergeant , equipped our first lab and attracted the first outside users . `` When the team got a Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter for making camera-ready copy of professional articles for publication and patent applications , Ossanna wrote a version of nroff that would drive it . It was dubbed troff , for typesetter 'roff . So it was that in 1973 he authored the first version of troff for Unix entirely written in PDP-11 assembly language . However , two years later , Ossanna re-wrote the code in the C programming language . He had planned another rewrite which was supposed to improve its usability but this work was taken over by Brian Kernighan.Ossanna was a member of the Association for Computing Machinery , Sigma Xi , and Tau Beta Pi.He died as a consequence of heart disease .

He also served as Ambassador to Italy from 1968 to 1969 . Ackley was a member of the University of Michigan faculty for 43 years and served as chair of its Economics department . Upon returning to the University following his ambassadorship , he was named the Henry Carter Adams Professor of Political Economy . In 1982 he served as President of the American Economic Association.Ackley was born in Indianapolis , Indiana in 1915 , and was raised in Kalamazoo , Michigan where he attended public schools and graduated from Western Michigan University in 1936 . He earned a Ph.D from the University of Michigan in 1940 , and joined the faculty that year .

He warned President Johnson in 1966 that a tax increase was needed to finance the escalation of the war in Vietnam and the increased social welfare spending that Johnson was undertaking . Johnson did not ask for a tax increase , and economists , including Paul Samuelson , believed this was the cause of the inflation of the 1970s.Ackley was the author of the popular graduate-level textbook Macroeconomic Theory , which was translated into several languages and remained the standard advanced text during the 1960s and early 1970s . He was awarded a fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968 and another fellowship from the Ford Foundation .

 = Thomas G. Barnes =   
Thomas G. Barnes ( August 14 , 1911 – October 23 , 2001 ) was an American creationist , who argued in support of his religious belief in a young earth by making the faulty scientific claims that the Earth 's magnetic field was consistently decaying and that Einstein 's theory of relativity was incorrect .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Barnes obtained three degrees in Physics : an AB from Hardin-Simmons University in 1933 , an MS from Brown University under Robert Bruce Lindsay in 1936 , and an honorary Sc.D . again from Hardin-Simmons University in 1950 . His detractors have questioned his credentials based on the fact that his doctorate was honorary.At the time that Barnes joined the Creation Research Society ( CRS ) in the early 1960s , he was the head of the Schellenger Research Laboratories at Texas Western College ( now University of Texas at El Paso ) , where he was completing a textbook on electricity and magnetism , and on whose faculty he served from 1938 until he retired in 1981 . Barnes headed one of the first projects of the CRS , to create a creationist high school biology text . Barnes served as the president of the CRS in the mid-1970s .   
    
    
 === Earth 's magnetic field decay ===   
 Barnes claimed to calculate the half-life of the earth 's magnetic field as approximately 1,400 years based on 130 years of empirical data . Some creationists have used Barnes ' argument as evidence for a young earth , less than 10,000 years as suggested by the Bible . His critics discredit this concept , claiming that Barnes failed to take experimental uncertainties into account and used an obsolete model of the interior of the earth .

His father Vladimir Aleksandrovich Altshuler ( 1882–1965 ) was a lawyer and former revolutionary who worked at the Soviet Ministry of Finances . Altshuler had a brother Sergei ( 1909–1979 ) and a sister Olga ( 1912–1992 ) . In 1932 he started working at the X-ray Laboratory of the Moscow Machine Building Institute . Two years later he enrolled to the Moscow State University , graduating in 1936 . Being a specialist in properties of metals and an aviation engineer , he was sent to the Soviet Army in 1940 , but in 1942 recalled from the front to the laboratories of the Soviet Academy of Sciences . During those World War II years he defended a PhD ( 1943 ) and developed a pulsed X-ray radiography method for real-time analysis of damage induced by a projectile to the tank armor , receiving the State Prize for this work in 1946 . The same year he was assigned to the Soviet atomic bomb project . Between 1946 and 1969 he worked at the Soviet Nuclear Center Arzamas-16 under top secret conditions , defending a habilitation in 1954 . His administrative promotions were hampered by his outspoken nature , as he publicly opposed some official views and policies . In 1969 he returned to Moscow , assuming a position of department head at the Institute of Optical-Physical Measurements . Twenty years later he became a Chief Researcher at the Institute for High Energy Densities of the Russian Academy of Sciences . In his late years Altshuler published several books and articles on high-pressure science and on the history of the Soviet Atomic Project.Altshuler was married to Mariya Speranskaya ( 1916–1977 ) ; they had three sons : Boris ( b . 1939 ) , Aleksandr ( b . 1945 ) and Mikhail ( b . 1955 ) . Boris became a notable physicist ; he moved to the United States in 1989 and besides his scientific research published a series of historical books related to Andrei Sakharov , his father and the Soviet atomic bomb project .

 = Jakob Philipp Kulik =   
Jakob Philipp Kulik ( 1793–1863 ) was an Austrian mathematician known for his construction of a massive factor tables .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Kulik was born in Lemberg , which was part of the Austrian empire , and is now Lviv located in Ukraine .   
    
    
 == Kulik 's factor tables ==   
 In 1825 , Kulik mentioned a table of factors up to 30 million , but this table does no longer seem to exist . It is also not clear if it had really been completed .   
 From about 1825 until 1863 Kulik produced a factor table of numbers up to 100330200 ( except for numbers divisible by 2 , 3 , or 5 ) . This table basically had the same format than the table to 30 million and it is therefore most likely that the work on the `` Magnus canon divisorum '' spanned from the mid-1820s to Kulik 's death , at which time the tables were still unfinished . These tables fill eight volumes totaling 4212 pages , and are kept in the archives of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna . Volume II of the 8-volume set has been lost .

 = Nahman Avigad =   
Nahman Avigad ( Hebrew : נחמן אביגד , September 25 , 1905 – January 28 , 1992 ) , born in Zawalow , Galicia ( then Austria , now Zavaliv , Ukraine ) , was an Israeli archaeologist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Avigad studied architecture in what is now the town of Brno , Czech Republic . Avigad emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1926 . He married Shulamit ( née Levin ) Avigad in 1928 . He worked in the excavations of the Beth Alpha synagogue and the Hamat Gader synagogue .   
 Avigad earned his PhD in 1952 , with a dissertation on the tombs of the Kidron Valley , Jerusalem . He taught at Hebrew University from 1949 and until his retirement in 1974 .   
 He directed the dig at Beit She'arim beginning in 1953 . Avigad also worked on the excavations of Masada , the mountaintop complex built by Herod the Great . He was involved in the exploration of caves in the Judean desert , and published one of the Dead Sea scrolls.In 1969 , Avigad was invited to undertake the excavation of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem , devastated by the 1948 war and its aftermath . Among the finds were what was believed to be the earliest depiction of the menorah that once burned in the Second Temple , cut into a wall plastered 2,200 years ago , and the Burnt House , the remnant of a building destroyed when Titus , the future Roman Emperor , repressed the Great Jewish Revolt against Roman rule . This was the first physical or archaeological evidence for the destruction described in the work of Flavius Josephus . The dig also unearthed lavish villas belonging to the Herodian upper classes , remains of the Byzantine Nea ( new ) Church and Jerusalem 's Cardo , a fifth-century 70-foot ( 21 m ) -wide road connecting the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and Nea Church . Among the most exciting finds was the remnants of the Broad Wall twice mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah . Built to defend Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE , there remains an 80-foot ( 24 m ) stretch of wall , 23 feet ( 7.0 m ) thick , rising from bedrock west of the Temple Mount . Nearby , Avigad also unearthed the Israelite Tower , a remnant of Jerusalem 's Iron Age fortifications attesting to the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BCE.Avigad published on many topics , notably on Hebrew seals . One of the seals found by him in 1964 has been tentatively identified as belonging to Queen Jezebel , mentioned in the Bible : however , this identification is contested by others .   
 According to Bible scholar Frank Moore Cross , Avigad “ was Israel ’ s most distinguished epigraphist in his generation , and one of the great figures in the history of Hebrew and Jewish epigraphy . ”   
    
    
 == Awards ==   
 In 1954 , Avigad was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought .   
 In 1977 , he was awarded the Israel Prize , for Land of Israel studies .   
 In 1984 , he received the Yakir Yerushalayim ( Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem ) award from the city of Jerusalem .

 = William Morris Leiserson =   
William Morris Leiserson ( 1883–1957 ) was a notable labor relations scholar and mediator .   
 Leiserson , perhaps the twentieth century 's most influential labor mediator during the rise of labor unions and collective bargaining in the United States , was a professor , state and federal government administrator , mediator , arbitrator , and a member of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’ s `` brain trust '' which developed and wrote legislation such as the Railway Labor Act of 1934 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in 1883 , in Reval , Tsarist Russia ( in an area later to become the nation of Estonia ) , William Morris Leiserson came to the United States at the age of seven with his mother and two brothers . As a student at the University of Wisconsin , he studied under Professor John R. Commons , whose life and work inspired Leiserson to pursue the fields of economics and labor relations . After graduation , he continued at Columbia University where he earned his Ph.D. under Henry Rogers Seager in 1911 .   
 Leiserson then began a distinguished career as a research scholar , professor and public administrator that was marked by four decades of high level service in an era of profound economic , political and cultural change . Shortly after receiving his Ph.D. he returned to Wisconsin where he originated the State Employment Service . Returning to academia , he held professorships at the University of Toledo and Antioch College . His U.S. government service included Chief of the Labor Administration Division of the United States Department of Labor , Secretary of the National Labor Board of the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) and member of the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) . The NLRB was the administrative arm of the Wagner Act , seminal legislation that guaranteed the right of workers to bargain collectively .   
 Leiserson 's favorite government position was chairman of the National Mediation Board . This organization became the U.S. government 's administrative arm for implementing the Railway Labor Act , which Leiserson was instrumental in writing for the U.S. Congress . The Act later was amended to include the airline industry . This , also seminal , legislation provided thorough , and effective procedures ( carefully not requiring lawyers ) for solving labor-management disputes among transportation workers and industries providing essential services to the U.S. economy . To this day the legislation provides a prototype for resolving disputes that involve essential services .   
 Most of the foregoing positions were appointments by President Franklin D. Roosevelt , during the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II . After leaving government service , he retired and returned to research and teaching at Johns Hopkins University . Leiserson died in 1957 at the age of 74.While he devoted much scholarly and research effort to increasing the government 's awareness of the status and needs of the wage earner , Leiserson understood well the role of the mediator and the art of balancing the interests of labor and management in industrial disputes . Leiserson was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Oberlin College , June 24 , 1947 .

 = Arthur von Oettingen =   
Arthur Joachim von Oettingen ( 28 March [ O.S . 15 ] 1836 – 5 September 1920 ) was a Baltic German physicist and music theorist . He was the brother of theologian Alexander von Oettingen ( 1827–1905 ) and ophthalmologist Georg von Oettingen ( 1824–1916 ) .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He studied astronomy and physics at the University of Dorpat , and furthered his education of physics in Paris in the laboratories of Antoine César Becquerel ( 1788–1878 ) and Henri Victor Régnault ( 1810–1878 ) , and afterwards at Berlin in the laboratories of Heinrich Gustav Magnus ( 1802–1870 ) , Johann Christian Poggendorff ( 1796–1877 ) and Heinrich Wilhelm Dove ( 1803–1879 ) .   
 In 1868 he became a professor at Dorpat , where he founded a meteorological observatory . In 1893 he moved to the University of Leipzig , where he remained until 1919 as a teacher and honorary professor . In 1898 and 1904 he published the third and fourth volumes of Poggendorff 's Biographisch-Literarisches Handwörterbuch der exakten Naturwissenschaften .   
 Oettingen was a primary advocate of a theory of acoustical relationships known as `` harmonic dualism '' . This concept was later expanded and elaborated on by musicologist Hugo Riemann ( 1849–1919 ) . Oettingen is also credited for introducing a measurement of musical interval known as the millioctave .

 = Samuel Kinsey =   
Samuel Kinsey ( 25 May 1832 – 8 June 1883 ) was a Christian minister and leader of the reactionary wing of the German Baptist Brethren that became the Old German Baptist Brethren .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Samuel Kinsey was born in Covington , Ohio on 25 May 1832 to Joel Kinsey and Elizabeth Brumbaugh . On 23 April 1852 , he married Barbara Nead , daughter of Peter Nead , and together they had thirteen children . He joined the Brethren as a member in 1853 . Kinsey was economically successful , and was at various times a carpenter , a farmer , proprietor of a general store , owner of a tree nursery , and publisher . The place where he lived became known as the town of Kinsey Station . He was a deacon and was elected in 1870 as a recognized minister of Lower Stillwater Brethren congregation in Randolph Township near Dayton , Ohio .   
    
    
 == Old Order leadership ==   
 Between 1851 and 1865 , Brethren periodicals began to be published under progressive editors Henry Kurtz , James Quinter , and Henry Holsinger . At the same time , Kinsey 's father-in-law , Peter Nead , was the primary leader for the reactionary wing of the Brethren , known as Old Order Brethren . Out of this group emerged a new periodical , The Vindicator , with Kinsey as editor . It was first published on 1 March 1870 as an eight-page monthly , composed of scriptural interpretations , exhortations to piety , and news on church affairs . One of its goals was to counter the influence of progressive Brethren periodicals.A major controversy among the Brethren arose over the authority of tradition and the role of the church in establishing a church order or ordnung , known as the `` order of the Brethren '' . In The Vindicator , Kinsey rejected that the church had any authority to change or adapt the order . This view sharply contrasted with other Brethren at the time . The group that became the Church of the Brethren revered tradition and supported the role of the church in discerning an ordnung , but held this order to be changeable . Meanwhile , the faction that became the Brethren Church rejected the need for a unified church order or agreement on practices not explicitly defined in Christian scripture and sought to eliminate some Brethren traditions which they felt lacked support from the scriptures.In around 1874 , Kinsey handed over control of his business interests to others in order to devote himself to the service of the church . He was a hymn writer . In 1878 , Kinsey was one of four men appointed and financially supported by the Southern Ohio District of the Brethren to engage in missionary work in Kentucky . This work was largely unsuccessful.A significant part of Kinsey 's ministry was also his ongoing publishing . The Vindicator was expanded to 32 pages per issue . His work was not well received ; Kinsey was reprimanded by the 1881 Brethren Annual Conference for encouraging dissension and criticizing church authorities . The Old German Baptist Brethren split at this conference , with Nead and Kinsey as their primary leaders . The proliferation of unauthorized and uncontrolled periodicals has been claimed as a major cause of the division . In 1882 , at their first meeting , the Old German Baptist Brethren recognized The Vindicator as their official publication . Kinsey was also ordained as an elder in 1882 .   
    
    
 == Death and legacy ==   
 Kinsey died on 8 June 1883 . He was succeeded as editor by Joseph I . Cover . The Vindicator set a precedent of conservative periodicals that was followed by Mennonite George R. Brunk 's Sword and Trumpet . Kinsey has continued to be influential in the Old German Baptist Brethren . The Vindicator continues to be published for the Old German Baptist Brethren as of 2008 .

 = Giovanni Urbani =   
Giovanni Urbani ( March 26 , 1900 – September 17 , 1969 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He served as Patriarch of Venice from 1958 until his death , and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958 . He was considered to be overly dependent upon his advisers .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Giovanni Urbani was born in Venice to Angelo and Elisabetta ( née Borghi ) Urbani , and was an artilleryman during World War I . After studying at the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice , he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro La Fontaine on September 24 , 1922 . Urbani then did pastoral work in Venice until 1925 , furthered his studies for a year , and taught at the seminary from 1927 to 1945 . He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on November 12 , 1936 , and later Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on June 5 , 1943 .   
 On October 26 , 1946 , he was appointed Titular Bishop of Axomis . Urbani received his episcopal consecration on the following December 8 from Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza , OCD , with Bishops Giovanni Jeremich and Carlo Zinato serving as co-consecrators , in St. Mark 's Basilica . Until 1955 , he served as secretary and national counselor of Azione Cattolica 's Central Commission , which included instructing Italian parishes against Communism . Urbani was promoted to Titular Archbishop of Sardes on November 27 , 1948 , and was later made Bishop of Verona , with the personal title of `` Archbishop '' , on April 14 , 1955 .   
 Pope John XXIII named Urbani to succeed him as Patriarch of Venice on November 11 , 1958 . He was the first native Venetian to become Patriarch since Cardinal Ludovico Flangini Giovanelli ( 1801–1804 ) , and was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Prisca by Pope John in the consistory of December 15 of that same year . His cardinalatial title was later changed to Cardinal Priest of S. Marco on March 19 , 1962 . From 1962 to 1965 , the Cardinal attended the Second Vatican Council . He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave , which selected Pope Paul VI . Because of his moderate views , Urbani was widely seen as papabile at the conclave . In 1964 , he prohibited Venetian priests and nuns from attending the Venice Biennale due to the nudism in its exhibitions.Urbani died from a heart attack in Venice , at age 69 . He is buried in St. Mark 's Basilica .   
    
    
 == Papal election ==   
 During the conclave of 1963 , he silenced Giovanni Battista Cardinal Montini after the latter proposed to withdraw his candidacy in order to avoid a prolonged deadlock .   
 His position as patriarch of Venice was unique in the fact that both his predecessor and his successor became pope . His successor as patriarch was Albino Luciani , who was elected Pope John Paul I in August 1978 .

 = John Henry Poynting =   
John Henry Poynting FRS ( 9 September 1852 – 30 March 1914 ) was an English physicist . He was a professor of physics at Mason Science College , from 1880 to 1900 , and then the successor institution , the University of Birmingham until his death .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Poynting was the youngest son of Thomas Elford Poynting , a Unitarian minister . He was born at the parsonage of the Monton Unitarian Chapel in Eccles , Lancashire ( his father serving as minister there from 1846 to 1878 . ) In his boyhood he was educated at the nearby school operated by his father . From 1867 to 1872 he attended Owens College , now the University of Manchester , where his physics teachers included Osborne Reynolds and Balfour Stewart . From 1872 to 1876 he was a student at Cambridge University , where he attained high honours in mathematics after taking grinds with Edward Routh . In the late 1870s he worked in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under James Clerk Maxwell.He was the developer and eponym of the Poynting vector , which describes the direction and magnitude of electromagnetic energy flow and is used in the Poynting theorem , a statement about energy conservation for electric and magnetic fields . This work was first published in 1884 . He performed a measurement of Newton 's gravitational constant by innovative means during 1893 . In 1903 he was the first to realise that the Sun 's radiation can draw in small particles towards it : this was later named the Poynting–Robertson effect .   
 He discovered the torsion-extension coupling in finite strain elasticity . This is now known as the ( positive ) Poynting effect in torsion .   
 Poynting and the Nobel prizewinner J. J. Thomson co-authored a multi-volume undergraduate physics textbook , which was in print for about 50 years and was in widespread use during the first third of the 20th century . Poynting wrote most of it.He was awarded an honorary MSc in Pure Science in 1901 by Birmingham University.Poynting lived at 11 St Augustine 's Road , Edgbaston with his family and servants for some years . He previously lived at 66 Beaufort Road , Edgbaston ( demolished ) and died of a diabetic coma , aged 61 , at 10 Ampton Road , Edgbaston in 1914 . In 1880 he married Maria Adney Cropper . Upon his death he was survived by his widow , a son , and two daughters .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Poynting 's most famous student may have been Alfred J. Lotka , who was inspired by Poynting to apply the ideas of physical chemistry to biology . Lotka dedicated his classic book on mathematical population biology to Poynting .   
    
 Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour , as is the main Physics building at the University of Birmingham and the departmental society there , the Poynting Physical Society .   
 He is credited with coining the expression `` greenhouse effect '' in 1909 to explain how infrared-absorbing trace gasses such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the surface temperature of Earth and Mars .

 = Alexander Catlin Twining =   
Alexander Catlin Twining ( July 5 , 1801 – November 22 , 1884 ) was an American scientist and inventor .   
 Twining , the son of Stephen Twining and Almira ( Catlin ) Twining , was born in New Haven , Conn. , July 5 , 1801 . He graduated from Yale College in 1820 . He left College with the intention of entering the ministry , and soon after studied for one year in Andover Theological Seminary . In 1823 he returned to New Haven as tutor in at Yale , in which office he served for two years .   
 Meanwhile he had decided to become a civil engineer , and now went to West Point to prepare himself for his profession . He was first employed upon the State works of Pennsylvania , and his earliest independent work was in 1835–37 as chief of the survey for the Hartford and New Haven Railroad ; he was subsequently employed either as chief or consulting engineer upon every railroad running out of New Haven ( excepting possibly the Derby road ) . In like manner he was employed on the northern lines running up the Connecticut River valley and through Vermont , on the Lake Shore road between Buffalo and Erie , and on other roads in Ohio , Illinois , and Michigan .   
 From 1839 to 1848 he filled the chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Middlebury College , Vt. ; this position he resigned to give himself more fully to his engineering labors . He removed from Middlebury to New Haven in 1852 , and resided there for the rest of his life . From 1856 until his death he was a deacon in the First Church , in which his father had filled the same office . For several years after his return to New Haven his labor was mainly given to the development of his invention for the artificial production of ice economically on a large scale . The principle of his invention was widely adopted , but he failed to secure pecuniary recompense for it . He made valuable original investigations in astronomy , mathematics and physics , and was equally interested in questions of theology and political science , both in their theoretical and practical aspects In connection with the remarkable meteor shower of November 1833 , he deserves the credit for first suggesting the correct theory of radiation of meteor tracks from a fixed point among the stars .   
 Early in October 1884 , he was attacked with congestion of the brain , and died at his home in New Haven on November 22 , at the age of 83 .   
 On March 2 , 1829 , Twining married Harriet Amelia Kinsley , of West Point , N. Y. , who died October 12 , 1871 . Their children were three sons ( graduates of Yale ) and four daughters , including the Rev . Kingsley Twining ; they survived their parents , with the exception of one son who died in the American Civil War .

Willis Linn Jepson ( August 19 , 1867 in Little Oak Ranch , near Vacaville , California – November 7 , 1946 in Berkeley , California ) is known as California 's most distinguished early botanist . He graduated from the University of California in 1889 , and became a UC professor in botany , a botanical writer , and a conservationist .   
    
    
 == History ==   
 Jepson became interested in botany as a boy and explored the adjacent San Francisco Bay Area regions . He had come in contact with various botanists before he entered college .   
 In 1892 , Jepson was 25 years old when he , John Muir , and Warren Olney formed the Sierra Club , in Olney 's law office in San Francisco .   
 From 1895 to 1898 Jepson served as instructor , and carried on research at UC Berkeley , Cornell ( 1895 ) and Harvard ( 1896–97 ) . He received his Ph.D. degree at University of California , Berkeley in 1899 .   
 He was made assistant professor in 1899 , associate professor in 1911 , professor in 1918 , and professor emeritus in 1937 . He was a Professor of Botany at UC Berkeley for four decades , thus his entire career was identified with the University of California .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Jepson wrote at least 11 books during his lifetime , with two focused on California 's trees . His works include A Flora of California ( 1909 ) , The Trees of California ( 1909 ) ; and the major A Manual of the Flowering Plants of California ( 1925 ) , predecessor of The Jepson Manual ( 1993 ) .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 His specimens , extensive archives and fieldbooks are housed in the University and Jepson Herbaria libraries and archives . Most of his specimens from California have been databased in the Jepson Online Interchange for California Floristics − Jepson eFlora ( TJM2 ) and form a multi-institutional Consortium of California Herbaria database .

 = Otto Stolz =   
Otto Stolz ( 3 July 1842 – 23 November 1905 ) was an Austrian mathematician noted for his work on mathematical analysis and infinitesimals . Born in Hall in Tirol , he studied in Innsbruck from 1860 and in Vienna from 1863 , receiving his habilitation there in 1867 . Two years later he studied in Berlin under Karl Weierstrass , Ernst Kummer and Leopold Kronecker , and in 1871 heard lectures in Göttingen by Alfred Clebsch and Felix Klein ( with whom he would later correspond ) , before returning to Innsbruck permanently as a professor of mathematics .   
 His work began with geometry ( on which he wrote his thesis ) but after the influence of Weierstrass it shifted to real analysis , and many small useful theorems are credited to him . For example , he proved that a continuous function f on a closed interval [ a , b ] with midpoint convexity , i.e. ,

 , has left and right derivatives at each point in ( a , b ) .He died in 1905 shortly after finishing work on Einleitung in die Funktionentheorie . His name lives on in the Stolz-Cesàro theorem .   
    
    
 == Work on non-Archimedean systems ==   
 Stolz published a number of papers containing constructions of non-Archimedean extensions of the real numbers , as detailed by Ehrlich ( 2006 ) . His work , as well as that of Paul du Bois-Reymond , was sharply criticized by Georg Cantor as an `` abomination '' . Cantor published a `` proof-sketch '' of the inconsistency of infinitesimals . The errors in Cantor 's proof are analyzed by Ehrlich ( 2006 ) .

 = Angelo Ruffini =   
Angelo Ruffini ( Pretare of Arquata del Tronto , 1864–1929 ) was an Italian histologist and embryologist .   
 He studied medicine at the University of Bologna , where beginning in 1894 he taught classes in histology . In 1903 he attained the chair of embryology at the University of Siena .   
 He was the first to describe small encapsulated nerve endings ( mechanoreceptors ) which were to become known as Ruffini corpuscles . He used a gold chloride stain on his microscope slides in order for to view the tiny corpuscles.Ruffini was a pioneer in the study of amphibian gastrulation , providing a comprehensive and detailed description on the formation of `` bottle cells '' . He published these findings in a book titled Fisiogenia ( 1925 ) .   
    
    
 == Relationship with Sir Charles Sherrington ==   
 Between 1896 and 1903 , Ruffini corresponded regularly with Sir Charles Sherrington . This relationship evolved after Ruffini sent copies of his papers on muscle nerve endings to Sherrington . Ruffini also sent Sherrington eleven slides of 'Organi nervosi ' ( available online ) and Sherrington was instrumental in getting Ruffini 's work published in the Journal of Physiology .

 = Konrad Koch =   
Wilhelm Carl Johann Conrad Koch , commonly known as Konrad Koch ( 13 February 1846 – 13 April 1911 ) was a German teacher and football pioneer .   
    
    
 == Early life and career ==   
 Koch was born on 13 February 1846 in Braunschweig , Duchy of Brunswick . After finishing secondary school in Braunschweig , he studied theology and philology at the universities of Göttingen , Berlin , and Leipzig.He returned to Braunschweig in 1868 to become a teacher for Ancient Greek , Latin , history , and geography at the prestigious Martino-Katharineum secondary school .   
    
    
 == Football ==   
    
 Koch was a pioneer in introducing ball games as part of physical education in German schools . He was influenced by the ideas of Thomas Arnold respectively Thomas Hughes ' novel Tom Brown 's School Days . In 1874 Koch and his colleague August Hermann organized what is believed to be the first-ever football match in Germany , between pupils from their school Martino-Katharineum . However , according to other sources , earlier games of football might have taken place in other German cities , possibly between members of the Dresden English Football Club.In 1875 , Koch published the first German version of the rules of football , although Koch 's version of the game still closely resembled rugby football . The new game was quickly adopted by other schools in Braunschweig and spread to other cities during the late 1870s , including Hanover , Bremen , Hamburg , and Göttingen.In 1876 , a newspaper in Hamburg wrote that Koch had learned about football during a trip to England . This is likely false , as there are no sources that indicate that he had visited England before 1895 . Koch did speak English , however , as he had been taught from a young age by his father , an English teacher .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Koch was a close friend of novelist Wilhelm Raabe , and like Raabe , C.F . Theodore Steinway and Heinrich Büssing , among others , a member of the social club Die ehrlichen Kleiderseller zu Braunschweig .

Abraham Haskel Taub ( ; February 1 , 1911 – August 9 , 1999 ) was a distinguished American mathematician and physicist , well known for his important contributions to the early development of general relativity , as well as differential geometry and differential equations .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 In a 1948 paper dealing with relativistic shock waves , Taub introduced a relativistic generalization of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions across a shock , which is now known as the Taub Adiabat . He also introduced the Taub–NUT space in general relativity .   
 Taub earned his doctorate at Princeton University in 1935 , under the direction of the prominent relativist Howard P. Robertson . At Princeton , Taub was also influenced by Oswald Veblen .   
 In 1948 , Abe Taub went to the University of Illinois as the chief mathematician associated with a project to build a computer based on von Neumann 's plans . The computer , called ORDVAC , was completed in 1952 and delivered to the Aberdeen Proving Grounds . A second copy of the computer , ILLIAC I , remained at Illinois and was the prototype for several other computers . Taub was head of the Digital Computer Laboratory at Illinois from 1961 until 1964 , when he moved to the University of California , Berkeley , as director of the Computer Center ( 1964–68 ) .

 = Franz Hauser =   
Franz Xaver Hauser ( 12 January 1794 in Krasowitz , today Krasovice , part of Kondrac , ( Benešov District ) , Czech Republic – 14 August 1870 in Freiburg im Breisgau ) was a singer , voice teacher , and music manuscript collector .   
 At his father 's insistence , he first studied medicine , but he then studied singing with Johann Wenzel Tomaschek and composition with oboist Josef Triebensee .   
 He made his stage debut in 1817 in Prague as Sarastro in Mozart 's Magic Flute . He found great success at the opera theaters in Vienna , Leipzig , and Berlin . He retired from the stage in 1838 and taught singing in Vienna . In 1846 he was appointed as director of the newly established conservatory in Munich ( now the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München ) , serving as its director until 1864 . He retired in 1865 to Karlsruhe and two years later to Freiburg im Breisgau .   
 Contemporary critics considered Hauser cold as an actor but approved of his pure voice . He was known for his interpretation of Weber and as Figaro ( both Rossini 's and Mozart 's ) , Bertram , William Tell , and Spohr 's Faust .   
 Hauser had many students including Jenny Lind and Henriette Sontag . He wrote a popular singing manual , Gesanglehre für Lehrer und Lernende ( Leipzig , 1866 ) ( freely available through Google books ) . As a composer , he was known for his songs . His correspondence with composer Moritz Hauptmann was published in two volumes in 1871 .   
 Hauser 's greatest significance today is as a collector of musical manuscripts –most notably of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach- assembling the greatest 19th century collection of that composer 's manuscripts . He was a consultant for the Bach-Gesellschaft edition and prepared a thematic catalogue of Bach 's works . Most of Hauser 's Bach manuscripts ( including 19 cantatas , the accompanied sonatas for violin , and the English suites for keyboard ) were acquired by the Berlin Royal Library in 1904 . Others were destroyed in 1945 . Parts of his collection are also in the Darmstadt Landesbibliothek and the Harvard University Loeb Music Library .   
 His son , Moritz Hauser ( 1827–1857 ) , became a theater director in Königsberg and a minor composer .

 = Arthur Milgram =   
Arthur Norton Milgram ( 3 June 1912 , in Philadelphia – 30 January 1961 ) was an American mathematician . He made contributions in functional analysis , combinatorics , differential geometry , topology , partial differential equations , and Galois theory . Perhaps one of his more famous contributions is the Lax–Milgram theorem—a theorem in functional analysis that is particularly applicable in the study of partial differential equations . In the third chapter of Emil Artin 's book Galois Theory , Milgram also discussed some applications of Galois theory . Milgram also contributed to graph theory , by co-authoring the article Verallgemeinerung eines graphentheoretischen Satzes von Rédei with Tibor Gallai in 1960.Milgram received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937 . He worked under the supervision of John Kline [ 1 ] ( a student of Robert Lee Moore ) . His dissertation was titled `` Decompositions and Dimension of Closed Sets in Rn '' .   
 Milgram advised 2 students at Syracuse University in the 1940s and 1950s ( Robert M. Exner [ 2 ] and Adnah Kostenbauder [ 3 ] ) . In the 1950s , Milgram moved to the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis and helped found Minnesota 's well-known PDE group ( [ 4 ] ) . At Minnesota , Milgram was also the Ph.D. advisor for Robert Duke Adams [ 5 ] . It is also worth noting that Milgram 's son R. James ( Richard ) Milgram [ 6 ] ( Professor Emeritus at Stanford [ 7 ] ) also studied mathematics and received his Ph.D. from Minnesota .

Lewis Thomas ( November 25 , 1913 – December 3 , 1993 ) was an American physician , poet , etymologist , essayist , administrator , educator , policy advisor , and researcher .   
 Thomas was born in Flushing , New York and attended Princeton University and Harvard Medical School . He became Dean of Yale Medical School and New York University School of Medicine , and President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute . His formative years as an independent medical researcher were at Tulane University School of Medicine .   
 He was invited to write regular essays in the New England Journal of Medicine . One collection of those essays , The Lives of a Cell : Notes of a Biology Watcher ( 1974 ) , won annual National Book Awards in two categories , Arts and Letters and The Sciences ( both awards were split ) .   
 ( He also won a Christopher Award for that book . ) Two other collections of essays ( originally published in NEJM and elsewhere ) were The Medusa and the Snail and Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler 's Ninth Symphony . In its first paperback edition , The Medusa and the Snail won another National Book Award in Science.His autobiography , The Youngest Science : Notes of a Medicine Watcher , is a record of a century of medicine and the changes which occurred in it . He also published a book on etymology titled Et Cetera , Et Cetera , poems , and numerous scientific papers .   
 Many of his essays discuss relationships among ideas or concepts using etymology as a starting point . Others concern the cultural implications of scientific discoveries and the growing awareness of ecology . In his essay on Mahler 's Ninth Symphony , Thomas addresses the anxieties produced by the development of nuclear weapons . Thomas is often quoted , given his notably eclectic interests and superlative prose style .   
 The Lewis Thomas Prize is awarded annually by The Rockefeller University to a scientist for artistic achievement .

Paul Grützner ( April 30 , 1847 – July 29 , 1919 ) was a German physiologist born in Festenberg , Silesia ( present-day Twardogóra , Lower Silesian Voivodeship ) .   
 He studied medicine at the universities of Würzburg , Berlin and Breslau , where he was a pupil of Rudolf Heidenhain . After graduation , he was an assistant at the physiological institute in Breslau . In 1881 he became a professor at the University of Bern , and in 1884 succeeded Karl von Vierordt ( 1818–1884 ) at the physiological institute at the University of Tübingen .   
 Grützner performed numerous studies involving the physiology of nerves and muscles , circulatory physiology , glandular and gastric secretions , et al . In the 1870s , with Wilhelm Ebstein ( 1836–1912 ) , he performed important research involving the physiochemical behavior of pepsin in the digestive tract . Findings from their research were published in an 1874 treatise called Ueber Pepsinbildung im Magen , and was included in Pflügers Archiv.Grützner is credited with introducing a colorimetric method for determining the quantity of pepsin in a solution . Among his numerous written articles was an 1879 physiological study on voice and speech titled Physiologie der Stimme und Sprache .

Albert Jay Solnit ( August 26 , 1919 – June 21 , 2002 ) was an American psychoanalyst in the tradition of ego psychology He was an advocate of privileging children 's needs in child custody cases . Solnit began teaching at the Yale School of Medicine in 1952 and was Sterling Professor of Psychiatry from 1970 to 1990 . He was an editor of The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child from 1980 to 2002 .   
    
    
 == Thematic interests ==   
 Solnit saw play as a signature expression of the child 's personality - something he linked to Winnicott 's concept of the transitional object.Solnit also emphasised the importance in an ongoing life of constructing `` a useful and self-respecting past ... a crucial aspect of the individual 's sense of free will is a knowledge of his own history that does not dominate '' .In a series of books co-authored with Anna Freud and legal scholar Joseph Goldstein , he stressed the importance of the psychological needs of the child in custody law .

 = Eugene Guth =   
Eugene Guth ( August 21 , 1905 – July 5 , 1990 ) was an American physicist who made contributions to polymer physics and to nuclear and solid state physics . He was awarded a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics by the University of Vienna in 1928 . He was a postdoctoral research associate with Wolfgang Pauli at the Austrian-German Science Foundation , Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) Zurich and University of Leipzig , with Werner Heisenberg from 1930 to 1931 . He was Professor at the University of Vienna ( 1932–1937 ) and the University of Notre Dame 1937-1955 . He was at Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1955 to 1971 .   
    
    
 == Discoveries ==   
 He is noted for several pioneering discoveries that advanced the field of polymer physics , which was recognised by the award of the Bingham Medal for rheology in 1965 . These included the treatment of the flexible , randomly kinked molecule in Brownian motion of polymers ; the explanation of the entropic origin of the elastic force ; and the Kinetic Theory of Rubber Elasticity.Aside from establishing the first polymer physics laboratory at an academic institution in America ,   
 Dr. Guth had an international reputation in physics and polymer science . In 1976 , he delivered the first plenary lecture on `` Birth and Rise of Polymer Science - Myth and Truth , '' before the International Symposium on Applied Polymer Science . Two years later , he received the University of Vienna 's Distinguished Alumnus Award , and in 1979 , he was awarded the Honor Cross of Science and Arts by President Rudolf Kirchschläger of the Republic of Austria . He remained interested in science throughout his entire life . His last article was published posthumously in 1991 in the Journal of Polymer Science Part B .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 A book , co-edited by his long-time friend and colleague Professor J. E. ( Jim ) Mark of the University of Cincinnati , was intended to celebrate Eugene Guth 's 85th birthday , but subsequently was published as a memorial . The book is entitled `` Elastomeric Polymer Networks '' , Prentice Hall Publishers , 1992 , ISBN 0-13-249483-3 .

 == Biography ==   
 Student of Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier at the Collège de Beauvais ( at the time a constituent college of the University of Paris ) , he found employment with the Ferme générale .   
 The poems and comedic plays he published early in his career were not successful . He turned to the study of geography and taught geography at the École Militaire during the 1760s . During the 1780s he taught geography to the royal household and in 1786 designed a globe , which is still on display in the Dauphin 's apartments at the Palace of Versailles .   
 A supporter of the French Revolution , he taught at the Écoles centrales and at the École Normale Supérieure . He was elected to the Institut de France in 1795 .

 = Giovanni Battista Brocchi =   
Giovanni Battista ( or Giambattista ) Brocchi ( 18 February 1772 – 25 September 1826 ) was an Italian naturalist , mineralogist and geologist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was born in Bassano del Grappa , Italy , and studied jurisprudence at the University of Padova , but his attention was turned to mineralogy and botany . In 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in the new lyceum of Brescia ; but he more especially devoted himself to geological researches in the adjacent districts . The fruits of these labors appeared in different publications , particularly in his Trattato mineralogico e chimico sulle miniere di ferro del dipartimento del Mella ( 1808 ) a treatise on the iron mines of the Mella traditional region . These researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in the recently established kingdom of Italy , and enabled him to extend his investigations over a great part of the country.In 1811 Brocchi produced a valuable essay entitled Memoria mineralogica sulla Valle di Fassa in Tirolo ; but his most important work is the Conchiologia fossile subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli Apennini , e sul suolo adiacente ( 2 vols. , Milan , 1814 ) , containing accurate details of the structure of the Apennine range , and an account of the fossils of the Italian Tertiary strata compared with existing species . These subjects were further illustrated by his geognostic map , and his Catalogo ragionato di una raccolta di rocce , disposto con ordine geografico , per servire alla geognosia dell ' Italia ( Milan , 1817 ) . His work Dello stato fisico del suolo di Rome ( 1820 ) , with its accompanying map , is likewise noteworthy . In it he corrected the erroneous views of Scipione Breislak , who conceived that Rome occupies the site of a volcano , to which he ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills . Brocchi pointed out that these materials were derived either from Monte Albano , an extinct volcano , twelve miles from the city , or from the Monti Cimini , still farther to the   
 north.In 1814 Brocchi presented the thesis that species , like individuals , age and eventually die out , - an idea that later influenced Charles Darwin.Several papers by him , on mineralogical subjects , appeared in the Biblioteca Italiana from 1816 to 1823 . In the latter year , Brocchi sailed for Egypt , in order to explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources . Every facility was granted by Mehemet Ali , who in 1825 appointed him one of a commission to examine the territory of the recently conquered Kingdom of Sennar ; but Brocchi , unfortunately for science , fell a victim to the climate , and died at Khartoum.Much of his writings and collections are now housed in the Museo Civico di Bassano .

Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon ( 9 September 1854 – 7 January 1917 ) was a Norwegian linguist and historian . He was a professor of Semitic Languages at the University of Oslo from 1907 .   
 Knudtzon was born in Trondheim , the son of consul Hans Nicolay Knudtzon ( 1814–89 ) and his wife Catharina ( 1831–79 ) née Trampe . Having finished his secondary education in 1872 , he enrolled at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania . After a short spell at the Cathedral School in Trondheim , he returned to Christiania to study Semitic languages , in particular Akkadian , Arabian and Hebrew , the last of which he also gave lectures on . His first scholarly contribution was Textkritische Bemerkungen zu Lay 17,18 , which was published in 1882 . In the same decade he studied assyriology and theology in Germany on a university stipend . He returned to Norway after only two years , and resumed his Hebrew teaching . In 1889 , he took his dr. phil . degree with the thesis Det saakaldte Perfektum og Imperfektum i Hebraisk ( `` The So-called Perfect and Preterite in Hebrew '' ) .In recognizing the Hittite language as Indo-European on the basis of two letters found in Egypt ( Die zwei Arzawa-Briefe , 1902 ) , he played an important role in the deciphering of the Hittite language script . In two landmark volumes ( 1907 and 1915 ) he published the Amarna letters , diplomatic correspondence of the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV , better known as Akhenaten ( 1351–1334 BCE ) .

 = Erik Benzelius the Elder =   
Erik Benzelius ( the Elder ) ( 16 December 1632 – 17 February 1709 ) was a Swedish theologian and Archbishop of Uppsala .   
 Benzelius was born at the Bentseby farm in the parish of Luleå in northern Sweden , son of the farmer and lay assessor ( nämndeman ) Henrik Jakobsson . He took a family name derived from his birthplace , rather than using the patronymic as was common in the Swedish peasantry . He was raised by a relative who was a merchant in Uppsala , and studied at Uppsala University , where he completed his filosofie magister degree in 1661 .   
 He was hired by Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie as a tutor for his sons in 1660 and accompanied one of them on a foreign journey stretching from 1663 to 1665 , visiting Copenhagen , the most important universities of Germany , and continuing to Paris , London , Oxford , and Leiden .   
 Returning to Uppsala , he was appointed professor extraordinary of history and moral philosophy in 1665 , of theology in 1666 , and 1670 ordinary professor of theology . He became bishop of Strängnäs in 1687 , and succeeded Olov Svebilius in 1700 as Archbishop of Uppsala .   
 He took an important part in the various ecclesiastical committees active during the reigns of Charles XI and Charles XII , such as that concerning the new Church Law of 1686 , the new hymn book of 1695 and the new Bible translation . In the Bible translation committee , created on the initiative of Jesper Swedberg , Benzelius was a conservative force , and is largely responsible for the fact that the so-called Charles XII 's Bible ended up as nothing more than a revision of the Swedish Reformation Bible .   
 Benzelius was a typical representative of 17th-century Swedish Lutheran orthodoxy , was careful not to deviate from established theological principles , and lacked originality in his writing . Nevertheless , he was a productive author of works in theology , and his work on church history was used as a textbook for the following century .   
 Of the seven sons of Benzelius , three later were appointed archbishops of Uppsala , one after the other : Erik ( 1675-1743 , appointed 1742 , but died before taking office ) , Jakob ( 1683-1747 , archbishop from 1744 ) , and Henrik ( 1689-1758 , archbishop from 1747 ) .

 = Lawrence Berk =   
Lawrence Berk ( December 10 , 1908 – December 22 , 1995 ) was the founder of Berklee College of Music , a pianist , composer and arranger , and educator .   
 Berk oversaw the growth of the modest Schillinger House music school into the Berklee College of Music , the largest independent school of music in the world . Between founding Schillinger House in 1945 and his retirement from Berklee College of Music in 1978 , his entrepreneurial and music-industry savvy enabled the school 's curriculum to keep place with popular music trends , developments in electronic music , and advancements in recording technology . He highly valued the practical application of classroom instruction , yet he guided the development of the curriculum to enable the school to become an accredited , degree-granting institution .   
    
    
 == Early life and career ==   
 Born and raised in Boston 's West End , Berk began playing professionally as a pianist at the age of 13 in dance orchestras led by Ruby Newman , Meyer Davis , and Joe Rines . He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in architectural engineering in 1932 . With few engineering jobs available during the Great Depression , he moved to New York City , where he became a staff arranger at NBC and studied with music theorist and teacher , Joseph Schillinger . During World War II , he returned to Boston to work as a mechanical engineer at Raytheon .   
    
    
 == Berklee College of Music ==   
 After Schillinger died in 1943 , Berk became one of 12 authorized teachers of the Schillinger System . He began teaching part-time on Saturdays with three students , but eventually quit his job at Raytheon to teach music full-time . In 1945 , he purchased a three-story building at 284 Newbury Street and opened Schillinger House . Under his direction , enrollment in the first nine years increased tenfold , the curriculum expanded to include music education , and alumni began appearing in nationally famous orchestras such as Stan Kenton 's .   
 In 1954 , he changed the name to the Berklee School of Music , after his son , Lee Eliot Berk , to better reflect the school 's broad curriculum . In the next few years , Berk added jazz musicians such as trumpeter Herb Pomeroy ( 1956 ) , saxophonist Charlie Mariano ( 1957 ) , drummer Alan Dawson ( 1957 ) , and reed player John LaPorta ( 1962 ) to the faculty . Starting with the arrival of pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi from Japan in 1956 , Berk also directed and expanded recruitment of foreign students , which in 2010 made up 24.2 percent of the student body . In 1957 , he instituted an innovative LP and score series , Jazz in the Classroom , featuring recordings of big band arrangements and performances by the school 's best students , packaged with copies of the arrangements . In 1962 , the school established the first college-level instrumental major in guitar.In 1966 , Berklee awarded its first bachelor of music degrees and moved into larger quarters at 1140 Boylston St . Under Berk 's leadership , the school offered the first college-level courses in rock and pop music and composing for commercials . In 1970 , it became the Berklee College of Music and Berk bestowed the college 's first honorary degree on Duke Ellington in 1971 . Other curriculum firsts included an electric bass guitar major established in 1973 , and a jazz-rock fusion ensemble established in 1974 . His final major expansion of college facilities was the acquisition of the Berklee Performance Center and an adjoining building used for additional classroom and rehearsal facilities and the college library in 1976.After he retired in 1978 , he served as chancellor until his death in 1995 . His son , Lee Eliot Berk , succeed him as president of the college in 1979 .

Noteworthy among these , especially for herpetologists , is Histoire naturelle des Reptiles , avec figures desinées d'après nature , in four volumes , which he wrote with Pierre André Latreille . This work includes descriptions and illustrations of many North American reptiles .   
 Another important work attributed to him is The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles , also dubbed the Sonnini manuscript , which was allegedly found in his publication Voyage en Grèce et en Turquie and later published and translated to English some time not earlier than 1801 . The work , which first appeared in London in 1871 , has received mixed opinions from different Christians , with most scholars rejecting it as a modern pseudepigraph .

 = George Henry Wood (statistician) =   
George Henry Wood ( 1874-1945 ) was a labour statistician , who was a student of and worked with Arthur Bowley .   
 Born in Bristol , he initially trained as an engineer . He was subsequently appointed to the statistical staff of the Labour Department of the Board of Trade.He resigned his post at the Labour Department in early 1908 to become Secretary for the Huddersfield and District Woollen Manufacturers and Spinners Association . In 1917 he became secretary to the Woolen and Worsted Trades Federation , a position he held until his death on 11 July 1945 . During World War I , he worked in the War Office on statistical matters relating to wool ; he acted as chief statistical officer to Wool Control in the Ministry of Supply in World War II.In 1910 he was awarded the Guy Medal in Silver of the Royal Statistical Society , and was a member of its Council from 1926 - 1929.Wood was a free thinker and was active in a variety of local radical movements in Huddersfield , including the Fabians . He collected wage statistics over a broad field and published much of his collected material .   
 `` E.C.R ( hodes ) . '' said in Wood 's obituary that `` It is impossible , within the limits of a short obituary notice , to do justice to all the varied aspects of Wood 's other activities or to his colourful personality . He had a wide range of interests , including the arts , music and ( above all ) cricket . He had made a close study of the history , and achieved marked success in the art and craft , of wood engraving ; making and shaping his own blocks , engraving them , and printing from them with his own press . He had a special enthusiasm for cricket , and had an amazing knowledge of the performances of the more prominent players of this and past generations . Those who were present when he entertained a few Fellows of the Society and leading cricketers after reading his paper on cricket scores in November 1944 , will recall with delight the informal discussion which followed , and his exchange of opinions and reminiscences with a distinguished ex-captain of All-England test teams and other first-class cricketers . Wood could be a doughty controversialist , when occasion arose , and his vehement defence of positions to the last ditch was sometimes liable to rouse antagonisms in the minds of those who were only slightly acquainted with him . Those who were privileged to enjoy his friendship , however , will long remember his kindly and generous nature , his staunch loyalty to colleagues and friends , and his invariable readiness to help a lame dog over the stile . ''   
 His extensive library , first loaned to Huddersfield Technical College in c.1925 , includes manuscript wages material , monographs , pamphlets , government reports and periodicals . The subjects covered include economic and social history , education , health , housing and women 's history . His work is archived at Heritage Quay at the University of Huddersfield.His hobbies included the arts , music and cricket . He studied the history and practical craft of wood engraving , using his own press . His interest in cricket led him to read a paper on cricket scores to the Royal Statistical Society in November 1944

Jakob Kolletschka ( 4 July 1803 , Biela ( now Luže ) , Bohemia – 13 March 1847 , Vienna ) was Professor of Forensic Medicine at Vienna General Hospital in Austria .   
 Jakob Kolletschka is mostly known for his death which eventually led Ignaz Semmelweis to his discovery of the etiology of childbed fever . Below is a quote from the original reference describing the details of his death .   
 In a lecture in 1846 he is reputed to have said , `` It is here no uncommon thing for midwives , especially in the commencement of their practice , to pull off legs and arms of infants , and even to pull away the entire body   
 and leave the head in the uterus . Such occurrences are not altogether uncommon ; they often happen . ''   
    
    
 == Death ==   
 Semmelweis had left for Venice on 2 March 1847 to escape the many deaths at the Viennese maternity institution , which haunted him . He returned to Vienna on 20 March 1847 .   
    
 I was immediately overwhelmed by the sad news that Professor [ Jakob ] Kolletschka , whom I greatly admired , had died in the interim .   
 The case history went as follows : Kolletschka , Professor of Forensic Medicine , often conducted autopsies for legal purposes in the company of students . During one such exercise , his finger was pricked by a student with the same knife that was being used in the autopsy . I do not recall which finger was cut . Professor Kolletschka contracted lymphangitis and phlebitis [ inflammation of the lymphatic vessels and of the veins respectively ] in the upper extremity . Then [ ... ] he died of bilateral pleurisy , pericarditis , peritonitis , and meningitis [ inflammation of the membranes of the lungs and thoracic cavity , of the fibroserous sac surrounding the heart , of the membranes of the abdomen and pelvic cavity , and of the membranes surrounding the brain , respectively ] . A few days before he died , a metastasis also formed in one eye . I was still animated by the art treasures of Venice , but the news of Kolletschka 's death agitated me still more . In this excited condition I could see clearly that the disease from which Kolletschka died was identical to that from which so many hundred maternity patients had also died . The maternity patients also had lymphangitis , peritonitis , pericarditis , pleurisy , and meningitis , and metastases also formed in many of them . Day and night I was haunted by the image of Kolletschka 's disease and was forced to recognize , ever more decisively , that the disease from which Kolletschka died was identical to that from which so many maternity patients died .

 = Paolo Straneo =   
Paolo Pietro Straneo ( 19 June 1874 , Genoa – 24 November 1968 , Genoa ) was an Italian mathematical physicist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Straneo studied at ETH Zurich , where he met and was a friend of Einstein . In 1897 he received his Ph.D. in natural philosophy of the University of Zurich . From 1899 he was a libero docente ( Privatdocent ) in mathematical physics and for some years he was a docente incaricato ( lecturer without tenure ) in mathematical physics at the University of Turin . After a period of working as a libero professionista ( an engineering consultant or a freelancer performing work similar to that of a libero docente ) , in 1924 he again became a libero docente and was put in charge of mathematical physics at the University of Genoa . There , from 1925 he was a professor ordinarius in mathematical physics and also taught theoretical physics .   
 He did research on mathematical physics , in particular , the theory of relativity.He contributed to the Enciclopedia Hoepli delle Matematiche elementari the articles : Teoria generale delle dimensioni fisiche ( General theory of physical dimensions ) and Materia , irraggiamento e fisica quantistica ( Matter , radiation and quantum physics ) .   
 Straneo was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1928 in Bologna and in 1932 in Zürich . He was elected a member of the Accademia nazionale dei Lincei .   
    
 The Atti dei LIncei contains in recent numbers two somewhat closely allied papers on thermo-electricity . The first of these is a verification of the principle of thermodynamic equivalence for bimetallic conductors , by Signor Paolo Straneo , who concludes not only that thermo-electric phenomena proceed regularly in perfect accord with theory , but they can be studied with sufficient exactness by temperature observations without recourse to calorimetry . The determination of the Peltier-effect coefficient by the author 's method succeeds even in the case in which previous methods are wanting in accuracy , namely , when the two metals possess a high specific resistance and a feeble Peltier-effect . With the present method , the Joule effect only slightly affects the phenomenon under consideration .   
 Signor Straneo 's method forms the basis of a paper by Signor A. Pochettino on variations of the Peltier-effect in a magnetic field . The value of the Peltier-effect was observed to vary with the magnetisation .

 = Robin Coombs =   
Robert Royston Amos Coombs FRS FRCPath FRCP ( 9 January 1921 – 25 January 2006 ) was a British immunologist , co-discoverer of the Coombs test ( 1945 ) used for detecting antibodies in various clinical scenarios , such as Rh disease and blood transfusion .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was born in London and studied veterinary medicine at the University of Edinburgh . In 1943 he entered King 's College , Cambridge , where he commenced work on a doctorate , which he gained in 1947 . Before finishing his doctorate , he developed and published methods to detect antibodies with Arthur Mourant and Robert Russell Race in 1945 . This is the test now referred to as the Coombs test , which , according to the legend , was first devised while Coombs was travelling on the train.Coombs became a professor and researcher at the Department of Pathology of University of Cambridge , becoming a Fellow of Corpus Christi College , and a founder of its Division of Immunology . He was appointed the fourth Quick Professor of Biology in 1966 and continued to work at Cambridge University until 1988 . He is reported to have said that `` [ r ] ed blood cells were primarily designed by God as tools for the immunologist and only secondarily as carriers of haemoglobin '' .In November 1956 , Coombs founded the noBritish Society for Immunology alongside John H. Humphrey , Bob White , and Avrion Mitchison . He was an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology.He received honorary doctoral degrees by the University of GuelphCanada , and the University of Edinburgh and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of the United Kingdom ( 1965 ) , a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians .   
 Coombs was married to Anne Blomfield , his first graduate student . They had a son and a daughter .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
    
 The Coombs test , which he developed and published together with Arthur Mourant and Robert Russell Race in 1945 , has formed the base of a large number of laboratory investigations in the fields of hematology and immunology.Together with Professor Philip George Howthern Gell , he developed a classification of immune mechanisms of tissue injury , now known as the `` Gell–Coombs classification '' , comprising four types of reactions.Together with W.E . Parish and A.F . Wells he put forward an explanation of sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) as an anaphylactic reaction to dairy proteins .

 = Norman Denbigh Riley =   
Norman Denbigh Riley CBE ( 26 September 1890 London – 26 May 1979 ) was a British entomologist with a special interest in the Lepidoptera and in particular the Lycaenidae . For many years he was keeper of entomology at the British Museum .   
 His first schooling took place at Dulwich College where his interest in natural history and Lepidoptera became evident . Richard South , the prominent entomologist was the Riley family 's neighbour in Balham and encouraged Norman Riley in his hobby . After he finishing school Riley enrolled at the Imperial College in order to take a course in entomology , and managed to find work there as a demonstrator under Ray Lankester , who was then director of the British Museum . At age 21 he was appointed as an assistant in the Entomology Department .   
 With the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Riley joined the Royal Army Service Corps , and saw service in France . At the end of the war he was discharged with the rank of captain and resumed his work at the museum , becoming keeper of entomology in 1932 . He became dedicated to acquiring gifts and purchases of specimens to expand the collection of the museum , and succeeded in creating a research resource of international renown .   
 Because of his easy and affable manner , Riley became popular as a committee-man and competently steered projects through financial and political pitfalls , becoming involved in national and international entomological matters . He served as both secretary and treasurer to the Entomological Society of London between 1926 and 1951 , and was elected president in 1952 . He was also a charter member of the Lepidopterists ' Society and served on their council , being elected vice-president in 1954 and president in 1958 . He also found time to be active in the Zoological Society of London . In 1923 , on the retirement of Richard South , his boyhood mentor , Riley took over the running of a small , but popular periodical called the Entomologist 's Monthly Magazine .

 = Auguste Le Guennant =   
Auguste Le Guennant ( 10 January 1881 – 17 May 1972 ) was a French organist , church musician and composer . He was , after positions as organist and head of the chapel in Paris and Nantes , the director and teacher at the Gregorian Institute of Paris , as a specialist of Gregorian chant .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in 1972 in Auray ( Morbihan ) , Auguste Le Guennant studied at the Schola Cantorum de Paris , the organ with Alexandre Guilmant and composition with Vincent d'Indy . He held for some time the position of organist at the grand organ of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt , and left Paris in 1905 to become head of the chapel at Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port in Les Sables-d'Olonne , and from 1908 at the Basilica of Saint-Nicolas in Nantes . He founded the mixed group A Capella in this city , in collaboration with A. Mahot .   
 The Mutual Edition of the Schola Cantorum published his Adagietto for organ , and an O Salutaris for four mixed voices . Mr. Biton published an accompanying book on Gregorian chant.In 1925 , Le Guennant arrived at the Gregorian Institute of Paris as director and teacher of Gregorian chant , succeeding Dom Joseph Gajard of the Solesmes Abbey .   
 After the Second World War , he organized many Gregorian sessions , not only in France but also in Fátima , and even Rio de Janeiro . Still teaching at the Gregorian Institute in Paris , this pedagogue and musician considerably boosted the teaching of Gregorian chant , by creating centres of study in several countries . When Maurice Duruflé thought about basing his Requiem on Gregorian chant , he asked Le Guennant for advice , and gratefully acknowledged his understanding . In 1960 , Duruflé dedicated a composition to Le Guennant , his Quatre Motets sur des thèmes grégoriens which were also based on chant.In 1953 , Le Guennant was awarded the Honorary Doctorate of the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome .

Alice Evelyn Wilson , MBE , FRSC , FRCGS ( August 26 , 1881 – April 15 , 1964 ) was Canada 's first female geologist . Her scientific studies of the rocks and fossils of the Ottawa region between 1913 and 1963 remain a respected source of knowledge .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Wilson grew up in Cobourg , Ontario . The canoeing and camping trips with her father and brothers sparked her interest in fossils . Her family also encouraged scholarly thought and the pursuit of scientific knowledge . In 1901 Wilson began studying modern language and history at the Victoria College in Toronto . She did not finish her last year of studies due to ill health . But she was hired by the Mineralogy Division of the University of Toronto Museum , thus beginning her career in geology . She later completed her degree and , in 1907 , was hired into a permanent position as a museum technician at the Geological Survey of Canada ( GSC ) , which was headquartered at the Victoria Memorial Museum in Ottawa .   
 Wilson persisted through seven years of being denied time off to pursue a higher degree in geology . Eventually , the Canadian Federation of University Women awarded her a scholarship so that she could embark on graduate studies at the University of Chicago . She graduated in 1929 with a doctorate in geology .   
 At the GSC , Wilson could not participate in fieldwork that required living in camps with men in remote regions . Instead , Wilson created her own niche and did fieldwork at local sites in the Ottawa area . For the next fifty years she studied this area on foot , by bicycle and eventually by car . The GSC published the results of her fieldwork in 1946 and her Geology of the St. Lawrence Lowland , Ontario and Quebec was the first major geological publication about the area . In addition to a comprehensive discussion of its geology , Wilson covered the area 's economic resources , including building stone , sand , gravel and drinking water .   
 From 1948 until 1958 Wilson was a lecturer in Paleontology at Carleton College ( later Carleton University ) . Carleton recognized Wilson both as a geologist and as an inspiring teacher with an honorary degree in 1960 . Wilson also worked to bring geology to a broader public . She wrote a children 's book , The Earth Beneath our Feet , aimed at encouraging broader knowledge and interest in the science she was so passionate about.Wilson became a respected member of the GSC and mentor to many young geologists . She retired at the age of 65 , as was required by law . However , she kept her office at the GSC and continued her work until her death in 1964 .   
    
    
 == Awards and professional recognition ==   
 Wilson was the first woman geologist hired by the Geological Survey of Canada ( 1909 ) , one of the first two women elected as Fellows of The Royal Canadian Geographical Society ( 1930 ) ; the first Canadian woman to be admitted to the Geological Society of America ( 1936 ) and the first female Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada ( 1938 ) .   
 In 1935 , when the government of R.B . Bennett was looking to honour a woman in the federal civil service , Wilson was chosen to become a Member of the Order of the British Empire .   
 In 1991 the Royal Society of Canada established the Alice Wilson Awards for emerging women scholars . Wilson was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 2005 .

Georg Theodor August Gaffky ( 17 February 1850 – 23 September 1918 ) was a Hanover born bacteriologist best known for identifying bacillus salmonella typhi as the cause of typhoid disease in 1884 .   
    
    
 == Early life and career ==   
 Gaffky 's parents were the shipping agent Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Gaffky , and Emma Schumacher . His medical studies at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin were completed in 1873 after an interruption by the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 . His dissertation postulated a relationship between lead poisoning and kidney disease . He worked as an assistant at the Berlin Charité hospital and passed the state medical exams in 1875 . He then worked as an army surgeon .   
 Gaffky worked as an assistant to Robert Koch in Berlin . Under Koch 's leadership , Gaffky and others developed bacteriological protocols and achieved progress in identifying causes of infectious diseases .   
    
    
 == Principal discoveries ==   
 Following Karl Joseph Eberth 's description of a bacillus suspected as the cause of typhus , and Koch 's independent work on the same organism , Gaffky dedicated years to improving culture methods to isolate the bacillus . He was able to produce cultures in gelatin and other hosts .   
 In 1884 , Gaffky published results reporting that he had isolated the eberthella or Gaffky-Eberth bacillus in 26 of 28 cases of typhoid.Gaffky was later part of an expedition to Egypt in which Koch identified transmission methods of cholera . He became a government advisor during the 1892 cholera outbreak in Hamburg . He led an investigation of the 1897 outbreak of bubonic plague in India .   
 Gaffky served as director of the Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases from 1904–1913 .

 = Fortunato of Brescia =   
Fortunato of Brescia ( 1701–1754 ) was an Italian Minorite of the Reform of Lombardy and anatomist .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born at Brescia , and received the religious habit in 1718 . A philosopher and theologian , Fortunato was also renowned for his studies in the natural sciences . He was secretary general of his order , and stood in high favour at the Bourbon court of Spain . He died in Madrid .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 He was among the first to bring together the teachings of Scholastic philosophy and the discoveries of the physical sciences . His scientific work is rendered important by his extensive use of the microscope , in which he followed the lead of Malpighi . Avoiding the then prevalent discussions on vitalism , he devoted himself to a positive study of the problems of natural science .   
 Convinced that a knowledge of microscopic anatomy is the key to the secrets of nature , he deemed two things to be of prime importance :   
    
 an experimental study of the histological constitution of the various organs , to learn their functions ; and   
 the separation of these organs into their elements , to determine their embryological origin.This view , clear in the works of Fortunato , has prevailed in pathology and physiology . and in this sense Fortunato was a pioneer . He confined himself to the microscopic study of the parts of the organism , and in this way succeeded in classifying tissues and organs many years before Bichat ( 1800 ) . Fortunato was the first to distinguish between tissues and organs .   
 He established the idea of tissues , or , as he wrote , `` of those organic parts which possess a definite structure visible with the microscope and characterized by their component elements '' . With sufficient accuracy he described connective and bony tissue . The morphological complexus of the various tissues he calls the `` system of tissues '' ; and the physiological complexus of the various organs he calls the `` system of organs '' .   
 From his many accurate descriptions , it is evident that his researches extended to many animals , and particularly to insects . He innovated in comparative anatomy , with ideas not found in Malpighi , Morgagni , Leeuwenhoek , or Haller , the path-finders in microscopic anatomy .

 = Sverre Petterssen =   
Sverre Petterssen ( 19 February 1898 – 31 December 1974 ) was a Norwegian meteorologist , prominent in the field of weather analysis and forecasting .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Born in Norway into a humble family , he paid for his higher education by working at the telegraph office , and a nursery provided by the armed forces that he joined as a recruit . He studied in Bergen where he met Tor Bergeron during a lecture , and was so impressed by his analysis of a 1922 storm that he joined the Bergen School of Meteorology in 1923 .   
 In the late 1920s he worked at the Geophysical Institute in Tromsø , northern Norway .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After school , he remained a weather officer in the Norwegian Air Force until 1939 . He went to the US in 1935 , lecturing on Norwegian meteorological theories to the US Navy and Caltech . In 1939 , he was hired by MIT as head of the meteorology department , and wrote two important books there : Weather analysis and forecasting ( 1940 ) and Introduction to Meteorology ( 1941 ) .   
 With the invasion of Norway , Petterssen returned to Europe and offered his services in England to the Met Office , on loan from the Norwegian Air Force . During World War II , he served as a weather forecaster for bombing raids and special operations .   
 He is most remembered for his work in what has been called the most significant weather forecast in history , the D-Day Forecast , where he contributed significantly to the postponement of D-day by one day . Three groups of meteorologists gave advice to General Dwight Eisenhower , and D-Day was originally planned for 5 June 1944 . But he got big trouble with academically untrained competitors , especially from the United States , who believed that the weather was repeated – and had found a weather recurring pattern in the 20s that they felt was positive . And General Dwight D. Eisenhower was relying on his men .   
 `` Pettersen , which was not always as diplomatic , made it clear that this was nonsense and quasi science but Eisenhower was convinced , and the invasion would take place on 5 June . But at the morning meeting on 4 June Pettersen presented a weather map showing a storm on 5 June . To strong protests from the American quasi-meteorologist , D-Day was postponed.The German war fleet was laid in Port : They thought it could not get any invasion because of the storm .   
 But the Norwegian meteorologist knew his meteorology : His analysis showed a 36-hour gap between two storms the morning of 6 June – just enough to make the giant attack with more than 100,000 soldiers , planes , paratroopers and boats . `` The forecast provided by Sverre Petterssen caused Eisenhower to decide at 0430 on 4 June to postpone D-day to 6 June . Initially it was proposed to postpone the operation to 19 June .   
    
 On 19 June the worst storm to date in the century struck the English channel . If D-Day had been launched on 5 June as originally planned , the Allied casualties would probably have been much higher , and even higher if launched on 19 June .   
    
    
 == Aftermath ==   
 In retrospect , Americans claimed – including in movies – it was their meteorologists heroes who saved the situation , and only in 1974 , shortly before his death , Sverre Pettersen came with his version – documenting a violent quarrel .   
 The American Meteorological historian James Fleming also honored Pettersen in a report 30 years later – in 2004 .

 = Emil L. Smith =   
Emil L. Smith ( July 5 , 1911 – May 31 , 2009 ) was an American biochemist who studied protein structure and function as well as biochemical evolution .   
 Initially intending to go into medicine , Smith became interested in biology and organic chemistry during his second year at Columbia University . He earned a B.S . in 1931 and stayed at Columbia to study photosynthesis under Selig Hecht , completing a Ph.D. in biophysics in 1936 . In 1938 , he went to Cambridge University on a Guggenheim Fellowship to work with David Keilin on the chlorophyll-protein complex . Upon returning to the U.S. during World War II , he took a position at Yale University 's Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station to work with Hubert Bradford Vickery . He joined the lab of eminent protein chemist Max Bergmann at the Rockefeller Institute in 1940 , where he worked with a number of important biochemists and began a significant line of research on the intestinal enzyme erepsin .   
 Between 1942 and 1946 , he worked at E. R. Squibb & Sons on the production of human blood products for use in the war . In 1946 he became an associate professor ( and ultimately full professor ) at the University of Utah . In 1958 , Emanuel Margoliash joined his lab and they began working on the peptide sequence of the protein cytochrome c ; based on comparisons between cytochrome c from different species , Smith and Margoliash performed some of the earliest work in the field of molecular evolution , applying the idea of the molecular clock to the highly conserved cytochrome c sequence . In 1969 , he worked with James Bonner to sequence histone H4 in several species , which was also of significant use in evolutionary studies .   
 In 1963 , he moved to UCLA as Professor and Chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry in the School of Medicine , and became an emeritus professor in 1979 .   
 In 1962 , he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences . In 1987 , Smith won the Stein-Moore Award of The Protein Society .

 = Roger A. Broucke =   
Roger A. Broucke ( March 25 , 1932 – June 21 , 2005 ) was an aerospace engineer known for his solutions to the three-body problem . After working on practical orbital mechanics at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , he became a professor at the University of Texas at Austin .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Broucke was born on a farm in Furnes , Belgium . He studied at the Catholic University of Leuven , earning bachelor 's and master 's degrees in mathematics in 1955 and 1957 respectively , under the mentorship of Georges Lemaître . After completing his military service he worked for the oil industry while earning a second master 's degree , in operations research , from the University of Brussels in 1960.He returned to Leuven for his doctoral work , on the three-body problem , which he completed in 1962 . At this time he moved to California to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ; while there , he also took adjunct positions at West Coast University , the University of Southern California , and the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . His position at UCLA became a regular-rank associate professorship in 1969.In 1975 , Broucke moved to the University of Texas at Austin as an associate professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics . At Austin , he helped found the Texas Institute for Computational Mechanics in 1976 .   
    
    
 == Contributions ==   
 In the three-body problem , Broucke 's doctoral research involved pioneering use of computer simulations to classify stable and unstable orbits . He investigated what happens to this classification for earth–moon–satellite systems in the limit as the ratio of earth to moon mass approaches zero ; his conjecture about this limiting behavior , `` Broucke 's principle '' , was finally proven correct in 1981 by Lawrence Perko . As part of this work , he also developed symbolic computation methods for handling Poisson series.Later , he studied the anisotropic Kepler problem , a mathematical model of the motion of an electron trapped in a potential well . As he showed , this system is not purely chaotic : it has periodic orbits as well . He also studied the use of gravity assist in finding efficient flight plans for space probes .   
    
    
 == Recognition ==   
 In 1973 , Broucke became executive editor of the journal Celestial Mechanics.The American Astronautical Society gave him their Dirk Brouwer Award in 2002 .

 = Wilhelm Mayer (composer) =   
Wilhelm Mayer ( 10 June 1831 – 22 January 1898 ) was an Austro-Bohemian composer who published his works under the name W. A. Rémy . He was also a noted teacher , whose pupils included Ferruccio Busoni and Felix Weingartner . His name sometimes appears as Wilhelm Mayer-Rémy .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Wilhelm Mayer ( some sources say his full name was Benjamin Wilhelm Mayer ) was born in Prague , the son of a lawyer . He studied at the Prague Organ School in 1846 . His overture to Eugène Sue 's drama Jean Cavalier was written when he was 17 , but his parents required him to enter the legal profession . He graduated as a doctor of law in 1856 , when he was 25 . He then occupied various posts in the Austro-Hungarian civil service.In 1862 he took up music once again , becoming conductor of the Steiermärkischer Musikverein in Graz . During his eight-year stay in that post , he introduced a number of his own compositions , such as the overture Sardanapalus , the symphonic poem Helena , and a Symphony in F major . These three works were also presented in Leipzig.After resigning as conductor in 1870 , he devoted himself to composition and private teaching . He published his works under the name W. A. Rémy , an anagram of `` W. Mayer '' . It has also been noted that the initials W. A. of his pseudonym are the same as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's , Mozart being his musical idol . Mayer focussed on the music of Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach , but greatly disliked Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner . For him , the first four preludes and fugues from Book I of Bach 's The Well-Tempered Clavier represented water , fire , earth and air respectively , and he conceived many others in a poetical light . He taught Luigi Cherubini 's methods for counterpoint , and used Hector Berlioz 's orchestral treatise.Through his former pupil Wilhelm Kienzl 's intercession with Ferruccio Busoni 's father , Busoni studied harmony , counterpoint , orchestration and composition with Mayer from November 1879 to April 1881 , being just 15 when he completed his formal studies with honours . Mayer taught Busoni that `` the widest possible culture makes the artist '' , a motto Busoni wrote on his 430-page treatise on composition he had written out in longhand during his studies with Mayer and later transmitted to his own pupils . Busoni wrote a `` Fugue in F major on a theme of W. A. Rémy '' ( BV 154 ) , and dedicated his Praeludium ( Basso ostinato ) und Fuge ( Doppelfuge zum Choral ) Op . 7 ( Op . 76 ) , for organ ( BV 157 ) to his teacher .   
 Mayer 's other notable students included Felix Weingartner , Richard Heuberger , Emil von Reznicek , Richard Sahla , Marie Baumayer Josef Gauby and Friedrich von Hausegger.As a teacher , Mayer was exacting , but also inspiring . His reputation extended throughout Europe . Emperor Franz Josef I awarded him the Knight 's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph , the only private music teacher ever so honoured.Mayer married and had a daughter , Melanie . He died in Graz in 1898 , aged 66 . His former student Ferruccio Busoni wrote a tribute to him in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung .

 = Charles Hyder =   
Charles Latif Hyder ( April 18 , 1930 – June 8 , 2004 ) , known in the USSR as `` Dr Haider , '' was an American astrophysicist and dissident from Albuquerque , New Mexico .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Hyder was born in Albuquerque , New Mexico in 1930 . After graduating from Albuquerque High School , he served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.Hyder attended the University of New Mexico , graduating with bachelor 's ( 1958 ) and master 's ( 1960 ) degrees in physics . In 1964 , he received a doctorate in astrophysics from the University of Colorado . Through the 1970s and 1980s , he was involved in various scientific activities in the field of solar physics , publishing more than 50 works , and was also involved in NASA 's Solar Maximum Mission satellite .   
 Hyder was married twice and had four children .   
    
    
 == Activism ==   
 Hyder was most noted for his strong anti-nuclear stance , as well as for hunger strikes which he used to advocate his causes . He began a supposed 218-day hunger strike on September 23 , 1986 near the White House in Washington , demanding that Ronald Reagan stop the arms race and eliminate the use of nuclear weapons.In the Soviet Union , Hyder was a regular participant on the broadcast program Vremya ( 'Time ' ) . A commemorative medal was minted in his honor . Mikhail Gorbachev wrote a letter to him , and when the hunger strike ended , Soviet punk rock band Nol ( 'Zero ' ) composed a satirical song entitled `` Доктор Хайдер '' ( `` Dr. Haider '' ) , with its refrain meaning `` Dr. Haider has started to eat again ! ''   
    
    
 == Controversy ==   
 In the USA , Hyder 's hunger strike did not attract much attention . Furthermore , the astrophysicist was not always present at the White House . The Russian Gosteleradio ( government broadcasting ) correspondent in Washington , Vladimir Dunaev , introduced and explained the scientist 's story to the Russian audience . Dunaev 's son later revealed that to make the hunger strike look continuous , Dunaev would shoot five stories in succession every day , asking Dr. Hyder to change into different suits and ties .   
 According to Dunaev , Hyder was advised by doctors to diet , as his weight openly threatened his health . During the hunger strike he lost almost half of his weight of 300 pounds . It was later revealed that Hyder drank fruit juice and took vitamins during the hunger strike . According to the most skeptical physicians , he fasted only in the daytime .   
 After the end of the hunger strike , Hyder ran for president . He also subsequently accused the USSR of environmental pollution , after which Russian news agencies stopped reporting about him in the USSR . In 1999 , he published the book `` Human Survival on a Plutonium-Contaminated Planet , '' again trying to fast in order to fight against the storage of nuclear waste ( Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ) .

 = Petrus Opmeer =   
Petrus Opmeer ( 1526–1594 ) was a Dutch Catholic historian and controversialist . According to his biographer Valerius Andreas , Opmeer was a friend of `` painters , sculptors and architects '' , including Maarten van Heemskerck , Pieter Aertsen , Willem Danielsz van Tetrode , Frans Floris , Antonis Mor and Philip Galle .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Petrus was born in Amsterdam on 13 September 1526 , the son of Pieter van Opmeer and Maria van Akersloot . Throughout his life he demonstrated a great love of learning , and had the family resources to pursue his interests . He was initially educated in Amsterdam at the school run by Alard van Amsterdam and Nicolaas Cannius , spent time in Leuven , and went to Tournai to learn French and mathematics . At the age of 19 he married Sophia Sasbout , and went to Delft to study Greek with Petrus Resenius , rector of the Latin school . He was studying civil and canon law at Leuven University when the Dutch Revolt broke out , prompting him to switch to theology .   
 After the murder of Cornelis Musius , Opmeer offered his services to the Army of Flanders , and was an appointed a secretary to the Council of War by Francisco de Valdez . After the Siege of Leiden he returned to his native Amsterdam until the city was lost to the rebels in 1578 and Catholic worship was prohibited . He then moved to Delft and lived there the rest of his life , dying on 4 November 1594 and being buried in the Oude Kerk . His son , Petrus Opmeer the Younger , published a number of his writings posthumously .

 = Charles Ashton (divine) =   
Charles Ashton ( 1665 – 1752 ) was an English churchman and academic , Master of Jesus College , Cambridge from 1701 .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Ashton was born on 25 May 1665 , at Bradway , in the parish of Norton , Derbyshire . He was admitted to Queens ' College , Cambridge , on 18 May 1682 , took the degree of B.A. , and on 30 April 1687 was elected to a fellowship . After serving for a time as chaplain to Bishop Simon Patrick , he was presented on 10 March 1698-9 to the living of Rattenden in Essex , which he exchanged in the following June for a chaplainship at Chelsea Hospital . On 3 July 1701 he was collated to a prebendal stall in Ely Cathedral , and was elected on the next day to the mastership of Jesus College , Cambridge , both offices being vacant by the death of William Saywell . In the same year he took the degree of D.D. , and in 1702 was elected vice-chancellor of the university .   
 Aston 's life was scholarly , and he seldom left Cambridge , except to go to Ely . He died in March 1752 , at the age of 87 , and was buried in the college chapel .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Ashton 's published works are not numerous . He contributed to Joseph Wasse 's Bibliotheca Literaria , 1724 , an article , `` Tully and Hirtius reconciled as to the time of Caesar 's going to the African war '' ; also an emendation of a passage of Justin Martyr . William Reading 's editions of Origen 's De Oratione ( 1728 ) and Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Scriptores ( 1746 ) are said to have been in great part the work of Ashton . According to George Dyer in his History of the University of Cambridge ( 1814 , ii . p. 80 ) , it was Ashton 's edition of Hierocles of Alexandria 's commentary on The golden verses of Pythagoras that was published as by `` R. W. '' ( i.e . Richard Warren ) .   
 In 1768 appeared an edition of Justin Martyr 's Apologiæ prepared by Frederick Keller , fellow of Jesus College , from papers that Ashton left at his death : all Ashton 's manuscripts had been bequeathed to Keller . Among the Cole MSS . in the British Library there are transcripts of some of Ashton 's letters to Dean Robert Moss ( vol . xxx . ) ; of his additions to John Sherman 's History of Jesus College ( vol . xlii . ) ; and of his Collections relating to the University . In Edmund Chishull 's Antiquitates Asiaticæ ( 1728 ) , Ashton restored a corrupt inscription to Jupiter Urios .

 = William Dallinger =   
William Henry Dallinger FRS ( 5 July 1839 – 7 November 1909 ) was a British minister in the Wesleyan Methodist Church . He was also an accomplished scientist , being the first to study the complete lifecycle of unicellular organisms under the microscope and studying the adaptation of such organisms to temperature.He made numerous contributions to microscopy , and was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1889 to 1892 . Dallinger was awarded three honorary doctorates , the Ll.D . from Victoria College , Toronto in 1884 , the D.Sc . from Dublin in 1892 , and the D.L.C . from Durham in 1896 .   
 Dallinger was married to Emma Ion Goldsmith ( 1842-1910 ) . They had one child , son Percy Gough ( 1867-1930 ) .   
    
    
 == Research into Darwin 's theories ==   
 Dallinger was one of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment . In the late 19th century , he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years ( 1880–1886 ) . Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °F up to 158 °F . The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °F , and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °F . The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment , on the other hand , were perfectly fine at 158 °F . However , these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °F . Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator , and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment . Unfortunately , Dallinger 's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886 , and Dallinger could not continue this line of research .   
 Dallinger was an early supporter of Darwinism . He accepted natural selection and considered creationism to be `` absolutely untenable '' . He believed there was no conflict between religion and science and there was no reason to try and reconcile the Book of Genesis with geology .

 = David Randall-MacIver =   
David Randall-MacIver FBA ( 31 October 1873 – 30 April 1945 ) was a British-born archaeologist , who later became an American citizen . He is most famous for his excavations at Great Zimbabwe which provided the first solid evidence that the site was built by Shona peoples .   
 Randall-MacIver was educated at The Queens College , Oxford . He graduated in 1896 with a first class degree . He began his professional archaeological career in 1898 working for Flinders Petrie in Egypt , uncovering the mortuary temple of Senwosret III at Abydos . In 1906 he was appointed as Curator of the Egyptian Section at the Penn Museum , University of Pennsylvania , taking charge of the collection following Sara Yorke Stevenson 's resignation in 1905.With funding from Eckley B. Coxe Jr. , Randall-MacIver initiated research into the relationship between Egypt and Nubia , uncovering some of the earliest evidence of ancient Nubian culture , dating back to 3100BCE . Between 1905 and 1906 Randall-MacIver conducted the first detailed study of Great Zimbabwe . The absence of any artefacts of non-African origin led him to conclude that the structure was built by local people . Earlier scholars had speculated that the structure had been built by Arab or Phoenician traders . Between 1907 and 1910 he excavated the site of Karanog , a former provincial capital of the Kingdom of Kush .   
 Randall-MacIver left Penn museum in 1911 following a disagreement with new Museum Director George Byron Gordon , becoming librarian of the American Geographical Society . In 1914 he left the AGS to work as a British intelligence officer in the First World War . In 1921 he moved to Italy to study Etruscan archaeology . He remained in Italy during World War II , assisting the Allied forces Monuments , Fine Arts , and Archives program , the famous `` Monuments Men '' , to preserve historical monuments and cultural property.Randall-MacIver died in New York City on 30 April 1945 .

 = Galileo Ferraris =   
Galileo Ferraris ( 31 October 1847 – 7 February 1897 ) was an Italian physicist and electrical engineer , one of the pioneers of AC power system and an inventor of the three-phase induction motor . Many newspapers touted that his work on the induction motor and power transmission systems were some of the greatest inventions of all ages . He published an extensive and complete monograph on the experimental results obtained with open-circuit transformers of the type designed by the power engineers Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born at Livorno Vercellese ( Kingdom of Sardinia ) , Ferraris gained a master 's degree in engineering and became an assistant of technical physics near the Regal Italian Industrial Museum . Ferraris independently researched the rotary magnetic field in 1885 . Ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors . The research and his studies resulted in the development of an alternator , which may be thought of as an alternating-current motor operating in reverse , so as to convert mechanical ( rotating ) power into electric power ( as alternating current ) .   
 On 11 March 1888 , Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin ( two months later Nikola Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 , application filed October 12 , 1887 . Serial Number 252,132 ) . These alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts , and depended on rotating magnetic field for their operation . The resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance . The invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification , as is the power transformer . These inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances . Polyphase power enabled the use of water-power ( via hydroelectric generating plants in large dams ) in remote places , thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity , which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done . This versatility sparked the growth of power-transmission network grids on continents around the globe .   
 In 1889 , Ferraris worked at the Italian Industrial Institution , a school of electrical engineering ( the first school of this kind in Italy , subsequently incorporated in the Politecnico di Torino ) . In 1896 , Ferraris joined the Italian Electrotechnical Association and became the first national president of the organization .   
 Galileo Ferraris did not confine his research interests to electricity . He also researched the fundamental properties of dioptric instruments and made elementary representation of the theory and its applications . His work contains a detailed description of the geometric dioptrics for uncentered systems . He provided a greater generality as previously found in the telescopic system treatments , with less emphasis on applications .   
 In the second main sections , the results obtained are applied to optical instruments . The magnification , field of view , and the brightness of the instrument were dealt with in great detail . The field denned as the author of the cone opening angle , the tip of the first main points of the lens , and its base formed by the parts of the object in view , will possess the same brightness . The eye is not treated .   
    
    
 == Memorials ==   
 The city of Turin honored the contributions that Ferraris made to science . A general committee proposed an addition to the Royal Industrial Museum of Turin with a permanent monument commemorating his scientific and industrial achievements . Additionally , an avenue was named in honor of Ferraris .

 = Leonard Dubkin =   
Leonard Dubkin ( 1905-1972 ) was an American author and naturalist from Chicago .   
 He is known for his books and newspaper columns on the subject of wildlife found in urban locations .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Leonard Dubkin was born in 1905 in Odessa , Ukraine ( then Russia . ) He came to the United States with his parents in 1907 . The oldest of seven with a chronically ill father , his family relied on Jewish charity organizations . In the eighth grade , Leonard dropped out of school to work and take care of his family . By the age of 12 he was taking meticulous notes on the life histories of butterflies and moths . He took an interest in nature from an early age and frequently contributed to the children 's pages of the Chicago Tribune . The social worker Jane Addams took an interest in him and gave him his first typewriter . This paved his way to a career in journalism.In 1934 he married actress Muriel Schwartz and created a local talent directory for radio and stage actors . This successful business allowed him to write his novels , review books for the New York Times , and correspond with other nature writers such as Rachel Carson and Edwin Way Teale .   
 Often featured in his books and columns is his daughter Pauline Yearwood , herself a successful journalist and the managing editor for the Chicago Jewish News .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Dubkin had difficulty committing to the topics assigned by editors in favor of observing nature . En route to cover a plane crash at Midway Airport , he stopped to observe a cricket singing in a field . By the time he got to the scene of the accident , all the survivors had been taken away . He missed another story by exploring a church tower where pigeons went to nest or die . On a pivotal case in which he was sent to interview a murder suspect , he became distracted by squirrels nesting in the walls of the suspect 's home . Upon returning to the office without a scoop , he was fired .   
 In the following period of unemployment and occasional dispiriting office jobs , he took to observing nature closely instead of looking for work . Among the creatures he observed in Chicago were ballooning spiders , bats , crickets , Polyphemus Moths and Cecropia moths.He eventually found work as an amateur naturalist , writing about his subject in a newspaper column with Lerner Newspapers and in his own books .   
 He authored six books , now out of print , about the natural history of Chicago , arguing for the preservation of secret places , small parks , and urban wildlife . He wrote a column called `` The Birds and Bees '' in the Lerner Newspapers , published between 1950 and 1972 . During this time there was little to no nature writing taking place in Chicago - conservation efforts focused on larger suburban spaces , such as forest preserves .   
 He became a champion of everyday wildlife and promoted the idea that wildlife worth observing was not necessarily exotic.A city park in Chicago is named for him , Dubkin Park , where he often ate lunch while working for the Lerner Newspapers . The park has a community garden , many species of native and non-native plants , and a blank wall along the Metra tracks . Before she died in 2016 , his daughter planted a peony in his memory at the park . It is still there .

Paulo Miki ( Japanese : パウロ三木 ; c. 1562 – 5 February 1597 ) was a Roman Catholic Japanese Jesuit seminarian , martyr and saint , one of the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Paulo Miki was born into a wealthy Japanese family . He was educated by the Jesuits in Azuchi and Takatsuki . He joined the Society of Jesus and became a well known and successful preacher – gaining numerous converts to Catholicism . The ruler of Japan , Toyotomi Hideyoshi , began persecuting Catholics for fear of the Jesuits ' influence and intentions , and possibly that of European visitors .   
 Miki was arrested and jailed with his fellow Catholics , who were later forced to march 966 kilometers ( 600 miles ) from Kyoto to Nagasaki ; all the while singing the Te Deum . On arriving in Nagasaki – which today has the largest Catholic population in Japan – Miki had his chest pierced with a lance while tied to a cross on 5 February 1597.He preached his last sermon from the cross , and it is maintained that he forgave his executioners , stating that he himself was Japanese . Crucified alongside him were Joan Soan ( de Gotó ) and Santiago Kisai , also of the Society of Jesus ; along with twenty-three other clergy and laity , all of whom were canonized by Pope Pius IX in 1862 .

 = Wilhelm August Lampadius =   
Wilhelm August Lampadius was born in Hehlen ( Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel ) on 8 August 1772 and died on 13 April 1842 in Freiberg . He was a German pharmacist in Göttingen from 1785 until 1791 . Also he was an `` extraordinary professor '' of chemistry and mineralogy in 1794 and an `` ordinary professor '' in 1795 . He taught at the Mining Academy in Freiberg .   
 Lampadius is best known for inflaming the first coal gas lantern on European ground .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Lampadius completed in five years ( started in 1785 ) his qualifications and became a pharmacist by completing the exam . At the University of Göttingen ( 1791–92 ) he was taught by Johann Friedrich Gmelin and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg .   
 After that he got to know Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Sigismund Friedrich Hermbstädt in Berlin . At the same time Joachim Graf von Sternberg offered Lampadius to accompany him on a research travel to Russia and China . Their trip stopped in Moscow because they did not get the permission to enter interior Russia . So Lampadius followed von Sternberg to his possessions in Bohemia . There he worked as a chemist for the ironworks in Radwitz .   
    
    
 Klaproth helped him to become a professors 's assistant at the mining academy in Freiberg . He specialized himself for metallurgical chemistry . Abraham Gottlob Werner recommended Lampadius and he was named as a professor for metallurgy .   
 In 1811/12 Lampadius illuminated his street in front of his house in Freiberg with the first hard coal gas lantern in Europe .   
    
    
 == Chemistry ==   
 In 1796 he accidentally obtained carbon disulfide ( Schwefelalcohol ) by destilling iron pyrites with moist charcoal . He concluded that sulphur and hydrogen are the source materials for the 'alcohol of sulphur ' . He is regarded as the discoverer for `` alcohol sulfuris '' .   
 He figured out that lead dissolves in acids more easily , if it is alloyed with tin . This realisation read him the harmfulness of many plates and pans .   
 He dealt also with researches about the fodder beet sugar .

Abraham a Sancta Clara ( July 2 , 1644 – December 1 , 1709 ) , German divine , was born at Kreenheinstetten , near Messkirch . His lay name was Johann Ulrich Megerle . He has been described as `` a very eccentric but popular Augustinian monk '' .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 In 1662 Abraham a Sancta Clara joined the Catholic religious order of Discalced Augustinians , and assumed the religious name by which he is known . In this order he rose step by step until he became prior provincialis and definitor of his province . Having early gained a great reputation for pulpit eloquence , he was appointed imperial court preacher at Vienna in 1669.The people flocked to hear him , attracted by the force and homeliness of his language , the grotesqueness of his humour , and the impartial severity with which he lashed the follies of all classes of society and of the court in particular . In general he spoke as a man of the people , the predominating quality of his style being an overflowing and often coarse wit . There are , however , many passages in his sermons in which he rises to loftier thought and uses more dignified language.In his published writings he displayed many of the same qualities as in the pulpit . Perhaps the most favorable specimen of his style is his didactic novel entitled Judas der Erzschelm ( 4 vols. , Salzburg , 1686–1695 ) . His works have been several times reproduced in whole or in part , though with many spurious interpolations . The best edition is that published in 21 vols . at Passau and Lindau ( 1835–1854 ) .

Gene Kan ( September 6 , 1976 — June 29 , 2002 ) was a British-born Chinese American peer-to-peer file-sharing programmer who was among the first programmers to produce an open-source version of the file-sharing application that implemented the Gnutella protocol . Kan worked together with Spencer Kimball on the program called `` gnubile '' licensed under the GNU General Public License . Kan graduated from the University of California , Berkeley in 1997 with a major in electrical engineering and computer science , and was a member of the student club the eXperimental Computing Facility ( XCF ) .   
 In June 2000 , when Kan was 24 , he formed a distributed search engine known as InfraSearch.com with Steve Waterhouse and another friend . Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen was an investor in the start-up . InfraSearch was purchased by Sun Microsystems on March 6 , 2001 for $ 12.5M USD in Sun stock options . The acquisition became part of the JXTA project at Sun . Kan joined Sun as an employee , and continued to work with the technology .   
 Kan was relatively well known in internet circles for a testimony he gave in July 2000 at the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on `` Intellectual Property in the Digital Age '' . Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich , Sony CEO Fred Ehrlich , and others also gave testimony at the hearing . In his account , as the United States Senate decides the fate of companies like Napster , he stressed that `` technology moves forward and leaves the stragglers behind , '' and that `` the adopters always win , and the stalwarts always lose '' . Kan was advocate of peer-to-peer ( P2P ) computing and some credit him , along with other Gnutella pioneers , as its originator . He argued that it is part of an emergent technological area called distributive computing.On June 29 , 2002 , he committed suicide . The cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head . Kan was 25 years old . Prior to taking his life , Kan updated an electronic copy of his resume hosted on a University of California , Berkeley server to read `` Summary : Sad example of a human being . Specializing in failure . '' An independent documentary film was planned for Gene Kan after he died , but it never started production .

 = Charles Auguste de B C3 A9riot =   
Charles Auguste de Bériot ( 20 February 1802 – 8 June 1870 ) was a Belgian violinist and composer .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in Leuven , where there is now a street named in his honor , he moved to France in 1810 , where he studied violin with Jean-François Tiby , a pupil of Giovanni Battista Viotti . He was later encouraged by Viotti himself and briefly worked with Pierre Baillot but did not embrace all their teachings and was also influenced by Paganini . He served as chamber violinist to King Charles X of France and to King William I of the Netherlands and toured with great success to London , Paris and the great music centres of Europe . In addition to playing the violin , he was a virtuosic pianist who toured through much of China despite the emperor 's objections .   
 Bériot lived with the opera singer Maria Malibran and had a child ( Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , a piano professor who taught Maurice Ravel , Ricardo Viñes , Enrique Granados and others ) with her in 1833 . They were married in 1836 when Malibran obtained an annulment of her previous marriage . Felix Mendelssohn wrote an aria accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple . However , Malibran died the same year from injuries sustained in a fall from a horse .   
 After Malibran 's death , de Bériot lived in Brussels and did not return to performance until 1838 . In 1840 in Vienna he married Marie Huber , daughter of a local magistrate.In 1842 , Pierre Baillot died in Paris at the age of 71 , and his position as instructor at the Paris Conservatoire was offered to de Bériot . He rejected the offer , however , and in 1843 became chief violin instructor at the Brussels Conservatory where he established the Franco-Belgian school of violin playing . On account of failing eyesight he retired in 1852 , and in 1858 became totally blind .   
 Paralysis of the left arm ended his career in 1866 . Surgeons amputated his left arm to relieve pain . Among his students were Hubert Léonard , Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst .   
    
    
 == Compositions ==   
 De Bériot composed a great amount of violin music including ten concertos . Although these are now rarely heard , his pedagogical compositions are still of use for violin students .   
 De Bériot 's pioneering violin technique and Romantic style of composition make his concertos and etudes an important stepping stone for the serious violin student wishing to gain a firm foundation before studying the major concertos of the Romantic era . His most popular concertos are No . 9 in A minor Op . 104 and No . 7 in G major Op . 76 .   
 Itzhak Perlman released a recording of Scene de Ballet , Op . 100 on his album , `` Concertos from My Childhood '' . This recording features the Juilliard Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster . Barbara Barber also released a recordings and sheet music with piano accompaniment of the first movement of de Beriot 's Concerto No . 9 in A minor Op . 104 and Scene de Ballet , Op . 100 with her series , `` Solos for Young Violinists '' .

Johann Anton Schmidt ( 6 May 1823-21 January 1905 ) was a German botanist . The standard author abbreviation J.A.Schmidt is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.Schmidt was born in Hamburg to a merchant family . Under the request of their family , he became a gardener and studied botany in 1843 at the University of Heidelberg ( with Gottlieb Wilhelm Bischoff ) and in 1849 at the University of Göttingen ( with August Grisebach and Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling ) , in 1850 , he was promoted with a dissertation of the causes of the plant to spread , in 1851 , he went to a collecting trip in the Cape Verdean Islands and studied its habilitation in Heidelberg on the local flora of Cape Verde .   
 In 1852 , he became private lecturer of Heidelberg and studied the local flora . He also provided for example , mint and figworts for Flora Brasiliensis by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius . In 1852 he became a member of the Leopoldine order . After the death of Gottlieb Wilhelm Bischoff , he temporarily headed the botanical garden . He hoped to have a full appointment succeeding Bischoff as director of the botanical gardens , instead , Wilhelm Hofmeister became in 1863 . He was announced back to Hamburg as a tutor . He suffered a stroke in 1902 and after the death of his wife in 1904 , he moved to Elberfeld , he died in 1905 .

 = Gaja Alaga =   
Gaja Alaga ( 3 July 1924 in Lemeš – 7 September 1988 in Zagreb ) was a Croatian theoretical physicist who specialised in nuclear physics .   
 He was born in noble family of Bunjevac Croats in the village of Lemeš ( today called Svetozar Miletić ) in northwestern Bačka in Kingdom of SHS ( today in autonomous province Vojvodina , Serbia ) .   
 He was a corresponding member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1968 and a professor at the University of Zagreb Faculty of Science ( Croatian : Prirodoslovno-matematički fakultet ) . He worked in the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb ( the capital city of Croatia ) , the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen , the University of California , Berkeley , and Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich .   
 In 1955 , cooperating with Kurt Alder and Ben Roy Mottelson , Alaga discovered the K-selection rules and intensity rules for beta and gamma transitions in deformed atom nuclei . This discovery was key to the development of new nuclei models which confirmed that subatomic particles can distort the shape of the nucleus . This is in accordance with the model for collective motion ( based on nuclei deformed from a spherical shape , but with axial symmetry ) for which Aage Bohr , Ben Roy Mottelson and James Rainwater won the 1975 Nobel Prize .   
 Also in 1955 ( the journal Physical Review ) and in 1957 ( the journal `` Nuclear Physics '' ) he discovered asymptotic selection rules for beta and gamma transitions between states of deformed nuclei . The so-called Alaga rules are in common use among specialists in nuclear structure , in comparing theoretical transition rates with measurements.He was the editor of the scientific magazine Fizika from 1978 until his death in 1988.He died in Zagreb in 1988 . Today , a street in the Trnje city district of Zagreb bears his name .

 = Emil Zuckerkandl =   
The organ of Zuckerkandl is a chromaffin body derived from neural crest located at the bifurcation of the aorta or at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery . It can be the source of a paraganglioma.The term para-aortic body is also sometimes used to describe it , as it usually arises near the abdominal aorta , but this term can be the source of confusion , because the term `` corpora paraaortica '' is also used to describe the aortic body , which arises near the thoracic aorta . This diffuse group of neuroendocrine sympathetic fibres was first described by Emil Zuckerkandl , a professor of anatomy at the University of Vienna , in 1901.Some sources equate the `` aortic bodies '' and `` paraaortic bodies '' , while other sources explicitly distinguish between the two . When a distinction is made , the `` aortic bodies '' are chemoreceptors which regulate circulation , while the `` paraaortic bodies '' are the chromaffin cells which manufacture catecholamines .   
    
    
 == Structure ==   
    
    
 == Function ==   
 Its physiological role is thought to be of greatest importance during the early gestational period as a homeostatic regulator of blood pressure , secreting catecholamines into the fetal circulation .   
 The organ itself regresses in the late third trimester and following birth to form the aorticosympathetic group of the adult paraganglia .   
    
    
 == Clinical significance ==   
    
    
 === Pathology ===   
 It can be the source of paraganglioma.The organ of Zuckerkandl is of pathological significance in the adult as a common extra-adrenal site of pheochromocytoma though the most common extra-adrenal site is in the superior para-aortic region between the diaphragm and lower renal poles.Extra-adrenal tumors account for around 10 % of all cases of pheochromocytoma . Resection has been described.In addition to its endocrine effects , it can also cause obstructive pathology .

 = George Paget Thomson =   
Sir George Paget Thomson , FRS ( ; 3 May 1892 – 10 September 1975 ) was an English physicist and Nobel laureate in physics recognised for his discovery of the wave properties of the electron by electron diffraction .   
    
    
 == Education and early life ==   
 Thomson was born in Cambridge , England , the son of physicist and Nobel laureate J. J. Thomson and Rose Elisabeth Paget , daughter of George Edward Paget . Thomson went to The Perse School , Cambridge before going on to read mathematics and physics at Trinity College , Cambridge , until the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , when he was commissioned into the Queen 's Royal West Surrey Regiment . After brief service in France , he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915 doing research on aerodynamics at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and elsewhere . He resigned his commission as a Captain in 1920 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After briefly serving in the First World War Thomson became a Fellow at Cambridge and then moved to the University of Aberdeen . George Thomson was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for his work in Aberdeen in discovering the wave-like properties of the electron . The prize was shared with Clinton Joseph Davisson who had made the same discovery independently . Whereas his father had seen the electron as a particle ( and won his Nobel Prize in the process ) , Thomson demonstrated that it could be diffracted like a wave , a discovery proving the principle of wave–particle duality which had first been posited by Louis-Victor de Broglie in the 1920s as what is often dubbed the de Broglie hypothesis .   
 Between 1929–1930 Thomson was a Non-Resident Lecturer at Cornell University , Ithaca , New York . In 1930 he was appointed Professor at Imperial College London in the chair of the late Hugh Longbourne Callendar . In the late 1930s and during the Second World War Thomson specialised in nuclear physics , concentrating on practical military applications . In particular Thomson was the chairman of the crucial MAUD Committee in 1940–1941 that concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible . In later life he continued this work on nuclear energy but also wrote works on aerodynamics and the value of science in society .   
 Thomson stayed at Imperial College until 1952 , when he became Master of Corpus Christi College , Cambridge . In 1964 , the college honoured his tenure with the George Thomson Building , a work of modernist architecture on the college 's Leckhampton campus .   
    
    
 == Awards and honours ==   
 In addition to winning the Nobel Prize in Physics , Thomson was knighted in 1943 . He gave the address `` Two aspects of science '' as president of the British Association for 1959–1960 .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
    
 In 1924 , Thomson married Kathleen Buchanan Smith , daughter of the Very Rev . Sir George Adam Smith . They had four children , two sons and two daughters . Kathleen died in 1941 . Thomson died in 1975 and is buried with his wife in Granchester Parish Churchyard . One son , Sir John Thomson GCMG ( 1927–2018 ) became a senior diplomat who served as High Commissioner to India ( 1977–82 ) and Permanent Representative to the United Nations ( 1982–87 ) , and his grandson Sir Adam Thomson KCMG ( 1955–present ) also became a senior diplomat , serving as High Commissioner to Pakistan ( 2010–2013 ) and as Permanent Representative to NATO ( 2014–2016 ) .

Annie M. Knott ( 1 September 1850 – December 20 , 1941 ) was an early student of Mary Baker Eddy and became a Christian Science practitioner and teacher . She first turned to Christian Science in an emergency involving her toddler son , afterward taking up the study of the religion and devoting her life to it . She later became a member of the Bible Lesson Committee and was the first woman to become a member of the Christian Science Board of Directors .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born Annie Macmillan , one of three daughters to religious Presbyterian Covenanters William and Catherine Macmillan ( nee Kerr ) , in Stewarton , East Ayrshire , Scotland . By the age of eight , she had committed entire chapters of the Bible to memory . Her father was a cousin of the founders of the Macmillan Publishing Company , Daniel and his brother Alexander Macmillan.Her family emigrated to Ontario , Canada when she was a girl and she grew up there . In 1876 , she was married to Kennard Knott . In 1878 , they moved to England , where he had been born . While in the London area and acting on a long-held desire to help the sick , she did volunteer work in local hospitals , although she was herself in poor health with bronchitis and other ailments . She began investigating alternatives to medicine , such as homeopathy . In 1881 , her little boy died while under the care of a doctor who was a grandson of Samuel Hahnemann , founder of homeopathy.In January 1882 , Knott and her daughters , aged two and four , emigrated to Chicago , where her husband had already relocated . They soon had another child , a boy . One afternoon , when this child was approaching his second birthday , Knott heard him screaming in the kitchen and discovered he 'd swallowed much of a bottle of disinfectant , carbolic acid . Doctors arrived shortly and said they did n't expect him to survive and if he did , he 'd never be able to swallow normally . Desperate for help , she turned to Christian Science . The child was soon relieved from pain and the next morning , recovered completely , helping himself to an apple he found in the pantry . The experience changed Knott . She had already purchased the Christian Science textbook and had been reading it ; after the experience with her son , she began a more intensive study of the book , during which she found her health improving . She then began offering to help others . She also had primary class instruction with a Christian Scientist.Around this time , her husband abandoned the family . In 1885 , having friends in Detroit , Michigan , Knott and her children moved there from Chicago . In 1887 and 1888 , she had class instruction with Mary Baker Eddy , who had founded the Christian Science church based upon what she called her discovery of the `` Science of the Christ . '' She was given the certificate C.S.D .   
 As a Christian Science practitioner and teacher , and from 1889 to April 1895 , pastor , she became a prominent resident of Detroit and was invited to be one of the people , mostly men , to write letters for the Detroit Century Box , a time capsule organized by the mayor , William C. Maybury . Her letter , along with those from Maybury , James E. Scripps , D. Augustus Straker and more than 50 others , was sealed in a metal box at midnight on December 31 , 1900 .

Henry Adrien Prévost de Longpérier ( 21 September 1816 , Paris – 14 January 1882 ) was a 19th-century French numismatist , archaeologist and curator .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Adrien was the son of Henry Simon Prevost Longpérier , a commander of the National Guard who was later mayor of Meaux from 1840 to 1848.In 1836 , he entered the cabinet des médailles of the Bibliothèque royale ( futur Bibliothèque nationale ) . Protected by Raoul-Rochette , he obtained the position of first employee in 1842 . In 1840 he published a fundamental study of numismatics of Sassanid sovereigns , and devoted several years later to numismatics of the Arsacids . With baron Jean de Witte , he founded the Bulletin archéologique de l ’ Athenaeum français . In 1856 , after the departure of Louis de La Saussaye , Adrien de Longpérier took over the direction of the Revue numismatique with Jean de Witte .   
 From 1847 to 1870 he was curator of the antiquities department of the Louvre . In 1848 he was the only curator of the Louvre not to be dismissed when the regime changed . As curator of antiquities he was responsible for collections from cultural areas and of varied ages . As such , he welcomed in the Louvre the first Assyrian sculptures arrived in France since Khorsabad , and took a close interest in deciphering the cuneiform script . He was also responsible for receiving the Campana collection . His numerous scientific interests include civilizations of America and national antiquities : Longpérier was behind the creation of a Mexican museum ( 1850 ) and a member of the commission for the establishment of the National Archaeological Museum in Saint-Germain-en-Laye .   
 In 1854 he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres . He was editor of the Revue numismatique from 1856 to 1872 . From 1858 he was a member of the Comité des travaux historiques et scientifiques .

 = Sat C5 8D Nobuhiro =   
Satō Nobuhiro ( 佐藤 信淵 , July 18 , 1769 – February 17 , 1850 ) was a Japanese scientist and early advocate of Japanese Westernization . He is considered the founder of the `` Greater East Asia '' concept .   
 Satō attempted to synthesize Western science ( especially Astronomy ) with Japanese political and philosophical thought . His ideas contributed to the early modern consolidation of the religion of Shinto , especially in the form of State Shinto . In his 1825 treatise Tenchūku , Satō argued that the cosmology in the Kojiki was both indigenous to Japan and the most compatible of all world religions with astronomy . He extended the Western model , however , by arguing that Shinto provided additional explanations for astronomical phenomenon that had not yet been explained by Western astronomy.Satō advocated an authoritarian government based on Western science and political institutions . In his Keizai yōryaku ( The Epitome of Economy ) , he wrote that `` The rationale of economy is to manage the realm , develop goods , make domains affluent , and succor everyone . ''   
 Satō considered the European great powers to be a threat that Japan needed to counter by radical economic and military reforms , as well as imperial expansion along European lines . His 1823 work A Secret Strategy for Expansion（宇内混同秘策） called for Japanese world domination , describing how China should be conquered via Manchuria . He suggested that the Japanese government embark on `` colonial and agricultural undertakings '' on uninhabited islands in the South China Sea . He also said that the Japanese government should take the Ryūkyū as a base to attack and capture Luzon Island by surprise , then use Luzon as a base for its `` southward advance '' to seize Java and other places , ultimately spreading its `` military might '' in Southeast Asia . He believed that Japan should `` adopt suitable means of aggression and annexation '' to `` increase its national interests . '' This became the first draft of Japan 's `` southward advance '' strategy .

John Gordon Skellam ( 1914-1979 ) was a statistician and ecologist , who discovered the Skellam distribution .   
 Skellam was born in Staffordshire . He was educated at Hanley High School where he won several scholarships including free admission to New College in Oxford . He was one of the most respected members of the British Region of the Biometric Society.In 1951 , John G. Skellam developed the reaction-diffusion model of invasion biology . This model describes the dynamics of populations , which simultaneously develops and spreads , and provides that the invasion front moves with constant speed . He explained on the basis of habitation muskrat introduced to Europe that only by chance the species may be in a place where it would have to grow.Skellam has provided a model that allows to take the dynamics of populations as a random variable at any time t. Its stochastic form is much more flexible than previous deterministic equations.He was principal scientific officer and editor of the `` Biometrics '' , the official organ of Biometric Society , an international association headquarters in London .

 = K C3 B4di Husimi =   
Kôdi Husimi ( June 29 , 1909 – May 8 , 2008 , Japanese : 伏見康治 ) was a Japanese theoretical physicist who served as the president of the Science Council of Japan . Husimi trees in graph theory , the Husimi Q representation in quantum mechanics , and Husimi 's theorem in the mathematics of paper folding are named after him .   
    
    
 == Education and career ==   
 Husimi studied at the University of Tokyo , graduating in 1933 . He spent a year there as an assistant , and then moved to Osaka University in 1934 , where he soon began working with Seishi Kikuchi . At Osaka , he became Dean of the Faculty of Science . He moved to Nagoya University in 1961 , and directed the plasma institute there . He retired in 1973 , and became a professor emeritus of both Nagoya and Osaka .   
    
    
 == Contributions ==   
    
    
 === Physics ===   
 A 1940 paper by Husimi introduced the Husimi Q representation in quantum mechanics . Husimi also gave the name to the kagome lattice , frequently used in statistical mechanics .   
    
    
 === Graph theory ===   
 In the mathematical area of graph theory , the name `` Husimi tree '' has come to refer to two different kinds of graphs : cactus graphs ( the graphs in which each edge belongs to at most one cycle ) and block graphs ( the graphs in which , for every cycle , all diagonals of the cycle are edges ) . Husimi studied cactus graphs in a 1950 paper , and the name `` Husimi trees '' was given to these graphs in a later paper by Frank Harary and George Eugene Uhlenbeck . Due to an error by later researchers , the name came to be applied to block graphs as well , causing it to become ambiguous and fall into disuse .   
    
    
 === Pacifism and world affairs ===   
 Husimi was an early member of the Science Council of Japan , joining it in 1949 , and it was largely through his efforts that the Science Council in 1954 issued a statement proposing principles for the peaceful use of nuclear power and opposing the continued existence of nuclear weapons . This statement , in turn , led to the Japanese law outlawing military uses of nuclear technology .   
 Later , he served as president of the Science Council of Japan from 1977 to 1982 . He was also a frequent participant in the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and a leader of the Committee of Seven for World Peace .   
    
    
 === Recreational mathematics ===   
 Husimi 's recreational interests included origami ; he designed several variations of the traditional orizuru ( paper crane ) , folded on paper shaped as a rhombus instead of the usual square , and studied the properties of the bird base that allow it to be varied within a continuous family of deformations .   
 With his wife , Mitsue Husimi , he wrote a book on the mathematics of origami , which included a theorem characterizing the folding patterns with four folds meeting at a single vertex that may be folded flat . The generalization of this theorem to arbitrary numbers of folds at a single vertex is sometimes called Husimi 's theorem .

 = Lindsay Helmholz =   
Lindsay Helmholz ( November 11 , 1909 – March 17 , 1993 ) was an American physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project during World War II that created the atomic bomb . He earned a PhD in chemistry at Johns Hopkins University before studying under Linus Pauling at California Institute of Technology and becoming a professor at Dartmouth College . After World War II , he joined the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis where he continued his work with X-ray diffraction and retired in 1978 .   
    
    
 == Chemistry studies ==   
 Lindsay Helmholz was born in Chicago on November 11 , 1909 , the son of Henry Helmholz and his wife Isabel née Lindsay . He had two brothers , Henry Frederic and August Carl Helmholz , and a sister , Margaret . He entered Cornell University in 1926 , and graduated two years later . He then went to Johns Hopkins University , where he submitted his PhD thesis on `` Lattice energies of rubidium bromide and sodium chloride and electron affinities of their halogens '' in 1933 , writing under the supervision of Joseph E. Mayer . He was one of the few students of Mayer who was an experimental rather than a theoretical chemist . He investigated the Born–Haber cycle in order to determine the electron affinity of fluorine .   
 Helmholz was a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow from 1934 to 1936 , and he studied crystallography at the California Institute of Technology , working under Linus Pauling . After his fellowship ended , he became an instructor there . Pauling attempted to secured Helmholz a more permanent position , at Duke University . He wrote to Paul Gross at Duke , describing Helmholz as `` one of our best men . '' Unsuccessful in this attempt , he then wrote to Elden B. Hartshorn at Dartmouth College : Dr. Helmholz is a pleasant and cultured young man and is married to a pleasant and cultured young woman . His father is head of the pediatrics division of the Mayo Foundation at Rochester .   
 This approach was ultimately successful , and Helmholz moved to Dartmouth College in 1941 as an assistant professor . He created his own X-ray apparatus in order to continue his research into crystallography .   
    
    
 == World War II and later career ==   
 During World War II , Helmholz worked on the Manhattan Project at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico . He was part of the committee that oversaw the RaLa Experiments , and worked out the chemical procedures for separating 100 curies ( 3.7 TBq ) of lanthanum-140 from barium chloride . He was also involved with the Water Boiler , an aqueous homogeneous reactor in which the nuclear fuel is dissolved in water . Helmholz conducted experiments with various compounds to find a suitable salt for use in this reactor . His experiments narrowed the choice to uranium sulfate and uranium nitrate , and the former was ultimately chosen because sulfur 's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen.After the war ended , Joseph W. Kennedy , the wartime head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Division at Los Alamos , became the head of the chemistry department at Washington University in St. Louis , and he recruited Helmholz , who was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1945 . Helmhoz brought his X-ray diffractometer with his from Dartmouth , and resumed his research into X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy . He became an associate professor in 1948 , and a professor in 1957 . A 1952 paper with his student Max Wolfsberg on `` The spectra and electronic structure of the tetrahedral ions MnO−4 , CrO−4 , and ClO−4 '' is today considered to represent `` the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way chemists approached the electronic structure of transition metal complexes '' , and a decade ahead of its time.Helmholz was acting chair of the department from 1963 to 1964 , and again from 1976 to 1978 . He retired in 1978 , and died on March 17 , 1993 .

 = Joachim Christian Timm =   
Joachim Christian Timm ( 7 December 1734 – 3 February 1805 ) was a German apothecary , mayor of Malchin , and a botanist with a particular interest in cryptograms . This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Timm when citing a botanical name .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Joachim Christian Timm , the son of tobacconist Matthias Ernst Timm ( 1704–1779 ) , was born in Wangerin in Farther Pomerania , Prussia ( now in Poland ) and attended school there . In 1749 he started a five-year apprenticeship as an apothecary , initially with Friedrich John in Wangerin , where he served for a year as an assistant . In the 1750s he was in Mecklenburg , working in Rostock . At the end of the 1750s he moved to Malchin to manage the apothecary business of Georg Heinrich Kruger and his successors . In 1760 , Timm became the official apothecary of Malchin . In 1771 he was elected senator . In 1778 he became the Second or Vice-Mayor of Malchin , becoming the Mayor in 1790 . The tradition of having more than one mayor to lead the town ended with his death .   
 As an apothecary , he was interested in botany . He enthusiastically collected plants of all kinds , especially cryptogams , primarily in the Malchin area . In 1788 he published his work Florae megapolitanae Prodromus , which he based on the system of the Swedish botanist Linnaeus . Professor Johann Hedwig of Leipzig later named a genus of moss Timmia after him , including the species he found at Malchin in Mecklenburg , Timmia megapolitana . The epithet megapolitania here refers to Mecklenburg , which was then often referred to by the Greek equivalent megapolis . At the instigation of the author of a monograph on Timmia , Guy Brassard , a mountain on the Arctic Ellesmere Island was named `` Mount Timmia '' in honour of Timm .   
 In 1762 , Timm married Anna Christine Elisabeth Witte ( 1743–1792 ) , a merchant 's daughter from Röbel . They had ten children , including the sons Joachim ( 1768–1801 ) and Hans Timm ( 1774–1852 ) , who one after the other succeeded their father as the official apothecary in Malchin . Another son , Helmuth Timm ( 1782–1848 ) , became a pastor in Groß Gievitz and later in Malchin .   
 Joachim Christian Timm died in Malchin in 1805 and is regarded today as a pioneer of modern botany in Germany .

 = Joseph Ritchie =   
Doctor Joseph Ritchie ( c. 1788 – 20 November 1819 ) was an English surgeon , explorer and naturalist . His primary interest lay in the natural sciences , though he is best known for playing a minor role in the British exploration of Africa .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 In 1818 , Ritchie was directed by Sir John Barrow to find the course of the River Niger and the location of Timbuktu . Ritchie chose subordinate George Francis Lyon to accompany him . The expedition was underfunded and lacked necessary support . Based on the recommendation of Barrow , they left from Tripoli and thus had to cross the entire Sahara , an arduous journey no modern European had ever done before . A year later , due to many delays , they had only reached as far as Murzuk , the capital of Fezzan , where they both fell ill with fever . They ran out of funds , and food , subsisting on dates and handouts from the local villagers who were little better off . Ritchie never recovered and died there , having made no new discoveries.Richie was distinctly unsuited to exploration . He was `` deeply self-centered , morose and uncommunicative '' . After arriving in Murzuk , he cut himself off from locals and even his own people . He was reserved , took little interest in the people and places he saw , took few notes , and generally spent much of his time indoors studying mathematics . Instead of stocking food and trade goods before departing Tripoli , Richie squandered the limited expedition funds on profligate items . After Ritchie died , George Lyon opened the crates they hauled through the desert and found things like 600 pounds of lead , a camel-load of cork for preserving insects , and two camel-loads of brown paper for pressing plants . Lyon sold what he could and was able to make it back to Tripoli , alive .

He was also a member of the Delegacy ( building committee ) , established on 8 April 1854 , that set up the Oxford University Museum.Augustus Hare , who matriculated at University College in 1853 , said of him :   
    
 `` It would be impossible to discover a more perfect ‘ old gentleman ’ than Dr Plumptre , though he was often laughed at . When he was inquiring into any fault , he would begin with , 'Now pray take care what you say , because whatever you say I shall believe . ' He had an old-fashioned veneration for rank , and let Lord Egmont off lectures two days in the week that he might hunt – 'it was so suitable . ' ”

 = Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann =   
Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann ( 1 July 1801 , Leipzig – 21 April 1877 , Halle an der Saale ) was a German physiologist , anatomist , and philosopher . He specialized in the study of the nervous and optic systems .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann was born in Leipzig , and enrolled in medicine there in 1821 . Together with Gustav Theodor Fechner , who got his degree in medicine in 1822 , and Rudolph Hermann Lotze ( 1817–1881 ) they formed a small intellectual group which dissolved only in 1837 when Volkmann received his professorship in Dorpat . In 1826 he obtained his doctorate and in 1828 he was habilitated as Privatdozent at the University of Leipzig . It was there that he became professor extraordinary of zootomy in 1834 . In 1837 he went to Dorpat ( now Tartu ) as professor of physiology , pathology and semiotics . However , his residence in Dorpat was short : he left for Halle as early as 1843 . After moving to Halle , Volkmann helped Gustav Theodor Fechner , his brother-in-law ( married to Volkmann ’ s sister Clara Fechner ) , with many experiments that formed the foundation of the epochal Elemente der Psychophysik . ( his daughter Anna Anschütz was later experimental subject for Fechner ) .   
 In 1854 Volkmann additionally took on the teaching of anatomy , until 1872 , when physiology was branched off and given to Julius Bernstein .   
 Volkmann ’ s house in Halle was a center of the city ’ s social life . Among his friends were the painters Wilhelm von Kügelgen , Friedrich Preller and Ludwig Richter , as well as the musicians Robert Franz , and Clara and Robert Schumann .   
 In 1872 , after his fiftieth doctoral jubilee he retired completely from his university activities . He died in Halle .   
    
    
 == Research ==   
 Today , Volkmann is most remembered for his additions to the physiology of the nervous system and physiological optics . In 1842 he demonstrated that sympathetic nerves were largely made up of medullated fibres arising from sympathetic and spinal ganglia . However , he also delineated and identified numerous features of gross anatomy , including Volkmann 's canals . Probably equally important , however , are his contributions to psychophysics and perception research . Fechner developed his classical psychophysical Method of average error ( already in use in astronomy ) in co-operation with Volkmann . In his 1864 treatise , Volkmann studied Weber ’ s law and reported that the threshold for distance discrimination increases with the increase of the reference distance . This was one of the first demonstrations of Weber ’ s law in the visual domain . Volkmann ’ s extensive experimental data in that book was the main basis on which Ewald Hering developed his theory of hyperacuity in 1899 . Philosophically , Volkmann was an evangelical who opposed materialism and gave a number of speeches against the materialist assumption of identity between the body and mind .

Vilém Kurz ( 23 December 1872 – 25 May 1945 ) was a Czech pianist and renowned piano teacher .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Kurz was born in Německý Brod , Bohemia in 1872 . He became a professor at the State Conservatory in Lviv and Vienna , and Prague Conservatory .   
 His students included his daughter Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová , Rudolf Firkušný , Eduard Steuermann , Artur Rodziński , Břetislav Bakala , Pavel Štěpán , Stanislav Heller , František Maxián , Gidéon Klein , Rafael Schächter , Viktorie Švihlíková , Stefania Turkewich , Ilja Hurník , Drahomir Toman , Zdeněk Jílek and Matusja Blum . See : List of music students by teacher : K to M # Vilém Kurz .   
 His teaching methods were largely based on those of Theodor Leschetizky and his pupils he met during the time he taught in Lviv . Later they were further developed by his daughter Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová .   
 He died in Prague in 1945 .   
    
    
 == Antonin Dvořák 's Piano Concerto in G minor ==   
 Kurz is known for his reworking of the solo part of Antonín Dvořák 's Piano Concerto in G minor , Op . 33 , which was originally composed in 1876 . For more than a decade after the concerto 's first performance , it suffered from neglect and critical disdain . A common remark for many years was that the piano part was written `` as if for two right hands . ''   
 While he was in his 20s , Kurz undertook a revision of the solo part , and it is this version that he frequently performed . Since that time , the original and the Kurz versions have been printed together in Otakar Šourek 's critical edition of the score , one beneath the other , so that the soloist can choose which version to perform . The Kurz version has become a part of the standard piano repertoire . Dvořák 's original orchestral material is not affected by the soloist 's choice . In 1919 Ilona Kurzová played the first performance of the Kurz version of the concerto , conducted by Václav Talich . This revision was later adopted and recorded by Rudolf Firkušný , who in the 1950s also introduced a few cuts to the first and third movements . In the 1970s he abandoned all revisions in favour of the original version by Dvořák .   
 Supraphon , the Czech recording company , issued a compact disc on which Ivan Moravec plays the Kurz version , with the Czech Philharmonic conducted by Jiří Bělohlávek , while Radoslav Kvapil plays the composer 's original score , with the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra under František Jílek .

 = Hans Merensky =   
Hans Merensky ( 16 March 1871 in Botshabelo – 21 October 1952 on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof ) was a South African geologist , prospector , scientist , conservationist and philanthropist . He discovered the rich deposit of alluvial diamonds at Alexander Bay in Namaqualand , vast platinum and chrome reefs at Lydenburg , Rustenburg and Potgietersrus , which led to some of the largest platinum mines in the world , phosphates and copper at Phalaborwa in the Transvaal lowveld , gold in the Free State and the world ’ s biggest chrome deposit at Jagdlust near Pietersburg .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Hans Merensky was born on 16 March 1871 at Berlin Missionary Society station Botshabelo , near Middelburg in Transvaal , where his father , Alexander Merensky ( 1837–1918 ) , a noted ethnographer and author , was the resident missionary . Keenly interested in minerals and enjoying outdoor living , he studied mining geology after finishing his schooling in Germany . He was awarded a doctorate in mining geology from the University of Charlottenburg in Berlin . He completed his practical training in coal mines in the Saarland and in Silesia and began work for the Department of Mines in East Prussia . In 1904 he came to South Africa to conduct some geological surveys in the Transvaal . He discovered tin near Pretoria and reported to the Premier Diamond Mine regarding possible mining prospects . He worked for several mining companies and Friedlaender & Co. sent him to Madagascar to investigate a reported discovery of gold , which turned out to be false . He resigned from his job in Germany and moved to Johannesburg where he became a successful consulting geologist .   
 In 1909 he visited the diamond fields of South West Africa and controversially predicted that diamonds would be found along the West coast and south of the Orange River . In 1913 Merensky lost his entire fortune due to the Depression , and was interned at a camp near Pietermaritzburg . During these financially difficult years he enjoyed the support of Sir George Albu .   
 In 1924 he followed up the discovery of alluvial platinum by A F Lombard on his farm in Lydenburg and discovered its source in the Bushveld Igneous Complex which set him on the road to financial recovery . This deposit came eventually to be known as the Merensky Reef , which contains 75 per cent of the world 's known platinum resources.In 1926 diamonds were found at Alexander Bay and Merensky received £1,250,000 for his prospector 's share . He established the Phosphate Development Corporation Ltd. - FOSKOR - to manage the extraction of phosphates at Phalaborwa .   
 In his final years he lived unostentatiously on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof in Transvaal , where he received local celebrities and foreign dignitaries . He died on 21 October 1952 .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Merensky allotted the larger part of his fortune to the Hans Merensky Trust to ensure that his projects in agriculture , horticulture and forestry operations on the Westfalia Estate would be continued after his death . He established the Hans Merensky Library at the University of Pretoria .   
 In 2004 , Martin Enlen directed a German language movie called Platinum based on Hans Merensky ’ s life . Both overdubbed and subtitled English versions of this movie exist.The Hans Merensky Wilderness , a protected area in Limpopo , and Merensky High School , an agricultural and academic public school on a farm near Tzaneen , are named after him .

Raoul Jobin , ( April 8 , 1906 – January 13 , 1974 ) was a French-Canadian operatic tenor , particularly associated with the French repertory .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Born Joseph Roméo Jobin in Quebec City , Quebec , where he first took private voice lessons before studying with Emile Larochelle at the Laval University . He then went to Paris to continue his studies with Mme d'Estainville-Rousset ( singing ) and Abby Chéreau ( stage skills ) , his exceptional voice quickly captured attention and he made his debut at the Paris Opéra on July 3 , 1930 , as Tybalt in Roméo et Juliette .   
 From then on , his career made rapid progress . He quickly sang principal tenor roles at both the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique , as well as in many cities throughout France , Lyons , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Marseilles , etc . He sang mainly the French repertoire , with occasional incursions into the Italian repertoire . In 1939 he created the role of Fabrice Del Dongo in La Chartreuse de Parme by Henri Sauguet . With the outbreak of the war , he returned to North America .   
 He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera on February 19 , 1940 , as des Grieux in Manon . He remained with the company until 1950 , where he sang many roles alongside such singers as Lily Pons , Bidu Sayao , Licia Albanese , Rise Stevens , under conductors such as   
 Wilfrid Pelletier and Thomas Beecham , among many others . He made regular appearances in San Francisco , Chicago , Boston , New Orleans , etc. , also appearing in Mexico City , Rio de Janeiro , and Buenos Aires .   
 The war over , he returned to Paris in 1947 , where he successfully sang his first major Wagnerian role , Lohengrin , earning him the nickname `` Monsieur Lohengrin '' . He later sang the role of Walther in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg with equal success .   
 Subsequently , Jobin divided his time largely between Europe and America , maintaining his high standard in his accustomed roles while adding new ones , until his retirement from the stage in 1958 .   
 He began teaching at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal , and later at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Québec where he notably served as director from 1961-1970 . He trained many young Canadian singers , notably Colette Boky and Huguette Tourangeau .   
 He had been created Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1951 , and he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1967 .

 = Franz von Pitha =   
Franz Freiherr von Pitha ( born Jiří František Piťha , February 8 , 1810 – December 29 , 1875 ) was an Austrian surgeon who was a native of Řakom , a village near Klatovy , Bohemia . He was rector of the Charles University in Prague in 1854–1855 .   
 In 1836 he received his medical doctorate at Prague , and was later a professor of surgery at Charles University in Prague , and at Josephs Academy ( Josephinum ) in Vienna , where he was chair of surgery from 1857 to 1874 .   
 During the Italian Wars of Independence , Pitha was chief of field medical services . In this role he made advancements in Austrian military hygiene , and also gained experience regarding battle-related injuries . He published a treatise titled Verletzungen und Krankheiten der Extremitäten ( Injuries and Diseases of the Extremities ) , as a result of his war-time experiences .   
 Pitha was instrumental in acquiring a position for Theodor Billroth ( 1829–1894 ) at the medical faculty in Vienna , and with Billroth he published an important textbook on surgery called Handbuch der allgemeinen und speciellen Chirurgie mit Einschluss der topographischen Anatomie , Operations- und Verbandlehre ( Textbook of General and Specialized Surgery with the Inclusion of Topographical Anatomy , Operations and Bandaging Skills ) .   
 Pitha was knight of the Order of Leopold and recipient of the Order of the Iron Crown 2nd class . He was ennobled in 1859 and raised to the baronial rank in January 1875 . He had three daughters with his wife Emilia née Barter .

 = Giulio Carlo de 27 Toschi di Fagnano =   
Giulio Carlo , Count Fagnano , and Marquis de Toschi ( December 6 , 1682 – September 26 , 1766 ) was an Italian mathematician . He was probably the first to direct attention to the theory of elliptic integrals . Fagnano was born in Senigallia .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
    
 Fagnano is best known for investigations on the length and division of arcs of certain curves , especially the lemniscate ; this seems also to have been in his own estimation his most important work , since he had the figure of the lemniscate with the inscription : `` Multifariam divisa atque dimensa Deo veritatis gloria '' , engraved on the title-page of his Produzioni Matematiche , which he published in two volumes ( Pesaro , 1750 ) , and dedicated to Pope Benedict XIV . The same figure and words `` Deo veritatis gloria '' also appear on his tomb .   
 Failing to rectify the ellipse or hyperbola , Fagnano attempted to determine arcs whose difference is rectifiable .   
 The word `` rectifiable '' meant at that time that the length can be found explicitly ,   
 which is different from its modern   
 meaning . He also pointed out the remarkable analogy existing between the integrals which represent the arc of a circle and the arc of a lemniscate . He also proved the formula

 = Margaret Neilson Armstrong =   
Margaret Neilson Armstrong ( 1867–1944 ) was a 20th-century American designer , illustrator , and author . She is best known for her book covers in the Art Nouveau style but also wrote and illustrated the first comprehensive guide to wildflowers of the American west . She also wrote mystery novels and biographies .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Margaret Neilson Armstrong was born on September 24 , 1867 , in New York City , the daughter of American diplomat and stained glass artist Maitland Armstrong and his wife Helen , who was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant and a niece of Hamilton Fish . Her six siblings included Helen Maitland Armstrong ( 1869–1948 ) , who followed in her father 's footsteps to become a stained glass artist , and Hamilton Fish Armstrong , a magazine editor .   
 She began her career as a designer in the 1880s , working initially for A.C. McClurg and later for other publishers as well . She designed more than 270 book covers and book bindings , about half of which were for Scribner 's . She worked in the Art Nouveau style and favored plant-related motifs , bold colors , gold stamping , and often slightly asymmetrical designs—an unusual combination that helped to distinguish her among her peers . Authors for whom she designed several covers include Frances Hodgson Burnett , Florence L. Barclay , George Washington Cable , Charles Dickens , Paul Laurence Dunbar , Robert Louis Stevenson , Henry van Dyke , and Myrtle Reed . She has been called `` the most productive and accomplished American book designer of the 1890s and early 1900s '' , and her work is often compared to that of her contemporary Alice Cordelia Morse.Her monogram appears on many covers after 1895 ; it is a simple 'MA ' in upper case with the 'M ' slightly overlapping the ' A'.Armstrong cut back on book cover design around 1913 as dust jackets began to come into fashion and turned to writing her own books . ( Her signature style was so successful , however , that publishers then hired artists specifically to imitate her look . ) An avid naturalist , Armstrong 's passion for natural forms reflected her interest in botany and in particular , in wildflowers . During the 1911-1914 period , she traveled and camped throughout the Western United States and Canada , becoming one of the first women to reach the bottom of the Grand Canyon . She discovered there several species of flowers that had not yet been identified by botanists . She details those and many other species in her Field Book of Western Wild Flowers ( 1915 ) . With its 550 illustrations ( 48 of which were in color ) , her Field Book is considered the first comprehensive guide on the subject.In her sixties and seventies , she wrote three critically praised mystery novels—Murder in Stained Glass ( 1939 ) , The Man with No Face ( 1940 ) , and The Blue Santo Murder Mystery ( 1941 ) —and two biographies , Fanny Kemble : A Passionate Victorian ( 1938 ) and Trelawny : A Man 's Life ( 1940 ) . She also completed her father 's memoirs .   
 She died in New York City in 1944.Her work is represented in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's collections and the collections of the New York Botanical Garden .

 = Gardner Lindzey =   
Gardner Edmund Lindzey ( November 27 , 1920 – February 4 , 2008 ) was an American psychologist and a past president of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) . After completing a doctorate at Harvard University , Lindzey served as a professor or administrator at several universities , edited a well-known textbook in social psychology and led a 1982 National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) panel that recommended the legalization of marijuana .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
    
 === Early life and education ===   
 Lindzey was born on November 27 , 1920 in Wilmington , Delaware . He attended Penn State University , earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in psychology . In 1949 , he finished a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University .   
    
    
 === Academic career ===   
 After teaching briefly at Harvard and spending several years at Syracuse University , Lindzey joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota . Psychologist and fellow faculty member Elliot Aronson described Lindzey as `` the star of the round table , an entertaining storyteller and a catalyst of conversation . And he seemed to know everything about everyone 's research ... But he would always find a way to make each person 's research relevant to the interests of the other people at the table . `` He chaired the psychology department at the University of Texas between 1964 and 1969 . Later , the university credited him with `` transforming the department from a relatively small and unassuming group to a large and internationally recognized faculty . '' Lindzey made contributions to personality psychology , social psychology , the history of psychology and behavioral genetics . He moved into educational administration at Texas , becoming the vice president for academic affairs and remaining there until 1975 . He then became the longest-serving director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences ( CASBS ) , running the center between 1975 and 1989 after completing fellowships there in 1954 , 1964 and 1972.In 1982 , he was a key member ( immediate past chair ) of the NAS committee that recommended the decriminalization of marijuana in An Analysis of Marijuana Policy , a report commissioned several years earlier by the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Other committee members included psychiatrist Daniel X. Freedman , former U.S. drug czar Jerome Jaffe , sociologists Denise Kandel and Howard S. Becker , psychologist and future university and foundation president Judith Rodin , future Nobel Prize winner in economics Thomas Schelling , and former CBS president Frank Stanton . The report highlighted the costs associated with the 400,000 annual marijuana-related arrests . When the report was published , NAS president Frank Press included a cover letter with it that criticized the report . Press thought that the committee had overstepped its bounds with its conclusions , which he said were better left to the political process . National Institute on Drug Abuse director William Pollin also said that it was `` a terrible mistake and a public health tragedy '' to advocate for societal acceptance of marijuana use .   
    
    
 === Later life ===   
 An athlete in high school , Lindzey continued to play tennis for several years after his retirement . He was ill for the last couple of years of his life . He spent some time in hospice care , but he was able to return to work as an editor almost up to the time that he died .   
    
    
 === Personal ===   
 Lindzey married Andrea Lewis in 1944 and they had five children . She died in 1984 . In his later years , he had a companion , a psychologist named Lyn Carlsmith .

Max Clara ( 12 February 1899 , Völs am Schlern , Italy – 13 March 1966 , Munich ) was a German anatomist . He was appointed as Chair of Anatomy at Leipzig University in 1935 . Clara is known for having close ties with the Nazi Party , controversially basing much of his work on his studies of the bodies of executed prisoners , without the consent of the prisoners ' families . His main work , `` Das Nervensystem des Menschen '' ( The Nervous System of Humans , alternatively The Human Nervous System ) was written in 1942 in Leipzig during the Third Reich 's dictatorship .   
 In 1937 , he discovered previously unknown cells found in human lungs , which were later eponymously named Clara cells ; because this was considered equivalent to honoring him , in 2013 medical journals began a two-year transition period of changing the name from `` Clara cell '' to `` club cell '' .   
    
    
 == Political activity ==   
 Clara was an active member of the Nazi Party , and became a professor at the University of Leipzig as a result of support from Max de Crinis . He subsequently proposed reforms to German law which had forbidden the scientific use of human cadavers without the consent of the deceased 's family ; he also proposed that , until such reforms could be implemented , researchers should preserve cadavers ' external appearance so that the deceased 's family would be unaware of what had been done.After the Second World War ended , Clara was officially denazified ; he subsequently taught at the University of Istanbul .

Matteo Liberatore ( born at Salerno , Italy , 14 August 1810 ; died at Rome , 18 October 1892 ) was an Italian Jesuit philosopher , theologian , and writer . He helped popularize the Jesuit periodical Civiltà Cattolica in close collaboration with the papacy in the last half of the 19th century .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Matteo was the son of Nicola Liberatore , a magistrate , and Caterina De Rosa who was from a noble Albanian family of Barile . He studied at the College of the Jesuits at Naples in 1825 , and a year later applied for admission into the Society of Jesus , entering the novitiate on 9 October 1826 . He taught philosophy at the Jesuit college of Naples for eleven years , from 1837 until the Revolution of 1848 drove him to Malta.On returning to Italy he was appointed to teach theology , but gave up his professorship in 1850 to cofound Civiltà Cattolica , a periodical founded by the Jesuits to defend the cause of the Church and the papacy , and to spread the knowledge of the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas . Liberatore 's helped bring about the revival of the scholastic philosophy of Aquinas , publishing his own course of philosophy in 1842 . This movement he promoted in the classroom , by textbooks on philosophy , by articles in Civiltà Cattolica and other periodicals , by larger and more extensive works , and also by his work as a member of the Accademia Romana by appointment of Leo XIII . In 1879 he contributed to Leo XIII 's encyclical Aeterni Patris on scholastic philosophy , promoting the teaching of Thomism in all Catholic schools . He also collaborated in the writing of the encyclical Immortale Dei ( 1885 ) and of Leo 's ground-breaking social encyclical Rerum novarum ( 1893 ) .   
 For 42 years , from 1850 to 1892 , Liberatore published over 390 articles , many apologetic in defense of the Holy See , drawing attention to Civiltà Cattolica . He predicted a more universal role for the papacy with the loss of temporal power . He was a close collaborator with Pius IX and Leo XIII and taught a philosophy course at the Pontifical Gregorian University where his students included Ambrogio Ratti , the future Pope Pius XI .

He was born in the Velikiye Luki district , Pskov Oblast . He graduated from the University of St. Petersburg , where in 1920 he became a Professor . From 1934 he was a Director of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics , a position he held for the rest of his life , except for the five-year period ( 1941–1946 ) when the institute was directed by Academician Sergei Sobolev . In 1941 he was awarded the Stalin Prize . In 1951 he became a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Kraków .   
    
    
 == Mathematical contributions ==   
 In analytic number theory , Vinogradov 's method refers to his main problem-solving technique , applied to central questions involving the estimation of exponential sums . In its most basic form , it is used to estimate sums over prime numbers , or Weyl sums . It is a reduction from a complicated sum to a number of smaller sums which are then simplified . The canonical form for prime number sums is

 = Gaspard Michaud =   
Louis André Gaspard Michaud ( 7 December 1795 in Sornac – 4 April 1880 in Lyons ) was a French malacologist . He is also known as Gaspard Michaud or as André Louis Gaspard Michaud .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Michaud was the son of a teacher who stimulated his son 's passion for natural sciences . He signed up for the infantry in 1813 . He was injured twice during the siege of Metz ( 1814–1815 ) . After his recovery in 1815 he became fully interested in natural sciences and began a conchological collection . When his father died in 1817 , he decided to stay in the army to support his family . His career went well and he became an officer in 1823 .   
 He started to publish his first scientific paper between 1828 and 1831 , dealing mainly with Mediterranean molluscs . In 1831 he published his major work , the Complément to the works of Draparnaud ( 1805 ) . In 1833 he wrote a first paper on the terrestrial molluscs of Algeria . From 1837 on he became interested in fossils , and started to publish several papers dealing with palaeomalacology . Together with Valéry Louis Victor Potiez ( 1806–1870 ) he published in 1835 the Galerie des mollusques , a catalogue of the molluscs in the collection of the museum of Douai .   
 In 1839 he became a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur , mainly because of his scientific contributions rather than because of his military service .   
 He left the army in 1844 , and started work as a professor and director of the Michaud Institute in Lyons . From then on he applied himself completely to the study of molluscan fossils . He published several papers ( 1855 , 1862 , 1876 , 1877 ) uncovering the Miocene fauna of the basin of Hauterives ( Drôme ) .   
 Part of his malacological collection is still preserved at the museum of Lyons . The rest of his collection , which was donated to museums in Brive and Mâcon has largely been lost .

 = Johann Josef Loschmidt =   
Johann Josef Loschmidt ( 15 March 1821 – 8 July 1895 ) , who referred to himself mostly as Josef Loschmidt ( omitting his first name ) , was a notable Austrian scientist who performed ground-breaking work in chemistry , physics ( thermodynamics , optics , electrodynamics ) , and crystal forms .   
 Born in Karlsbad , a town located in the Austrian Empire ( now Karlovy Vary , Czech Republic ) , Loschmidt became professor of physical chemistry at the University of Vienna in 1868 .   
 He had two early mentors . The first was a Bohemian priest , Adalbert Czech , who persuaded Loschmidt 's parents to send young Josef to high school in the Piarist monastery in Schlackenwerth and , in 1837 , to advanced high-school classes in Prague .   
 This was followed by two years of philosophy and mathematics at Prague 's Charles University , where Loschmidt met his second important mentor . This was the philosophy professor Franz Serafin Exner , whose eyesight was failing , and who asked Loschmidt to be his personal reader . Exner was known for his innovative school reforms , which included promoting mathematics and science as important subjects . He suggested to Loschmidt , who became a close personal friend , that he apply mathematics to psychological phenomena . In the process of doing this , he became a very able mathematician .   
 The era , when Loschmidt gradually developed his ideas on molecular structures , was to be a notable epoch in science . It was the time when the Kinetic Theory of Gases was being developed.His 1861 booklet , Chemische Studien ( `` chemical studies '' ) , proposed two-dimensional representations for over 300 molecules in a style remarkably similar to that used by modern chemists . Among these were aromatic molecules such as benzene ( C6H6 ) , and related triazines . Loschmidt symbolized the benzene nucleus by a large circle , which he said was to indicate the yet-undetermined structure of the compound . Some have argued , however , that he intended this as the suggestion of a cyclical structure , four years before that of Kekulé , who is better known and is generally credited with the discovery of benzene 's cyclic structure .   
 In 1865 , Loschmidt was the first to estimate the size of the molecules that make up the air : his result was only twice the true size , a remarkable feat given the approximations he had to make . His method allowed the size of any gas molecules to be related to measurable phenomena , and hence to determine how many molecules are present in a given volume of gas . This latter quantity is now known as the Loschmidt constant in his honour , and its modern value is 2.69×1019 molecules per cubic centimetre at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) .Loschmidt and his younger university colleague Ludwig Boltzmann became good friends . His critique of Boltzmann 's attempt to derive the second law of thermodynamics from kinetic theory became famous as the `` reversibility paradox '' . It led Boltzmann to his statistical concept of entropy as a logarithmic tally of the number of microstates corresponding to a given thermodynamic state .   
 Loschmidt retired from university in 1891 and died in 1895 in Vienna . His only child had died before him at the age of ten .

 == Life ==   
 He was baptised at Little Brickhill , Buckinghamshire , and was admitted pensioner of Pembroke College , Cambridge , 4 July 1627 . He was elected to a scholarship in 1630 , and to a fellowship 8 October 1634 , having become M.A . the same year . In 1641 he became B.D. , and was chosen junior treasurer of his college , and senior treasurer in 1642.He had attracted the favourable notice of Charles I by a sermon he preached at Paul 's Cross before the lord mayor and aldermen in 1641 on Jeremiah xxxv . 18-19 , which the king commanded to be printed . In this sermon he propounds the Rechabites as an example of obedience ; 'It is a usual thing nowadays , ' he says , 'to direct our governours what to do , what to read , what to command ; then , forsooth , we will obey them . ' In 1644 he was ejected as a malignant by the parliamentary visitors , on his refusal to take the Solemn League and Covenant .   
 At the Restoration Frank was re-established in his fellowship 10 August 1660 , and rewarded by ecclesiastical promotions . He was made D.D . by royal mandate in 1661 , and was chosen master of his college 23 August 1662 , in succession to Benjamin Lany . Archbishop William Juxon appointed him one of his chaplains , and he held the office of domestic chaplain and ex officio licenser of theological works to Juxon 's successor , Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon , by whom he was presented to the archdeaconry of St. Albans , and to the treasurership of St. Paul 's Cathedral , 19 December 1660 . He was also presented to the rectory of Barley , Hertfordshire , 2 February 1664 , by Matthew Wren . He died the following year , at the age of fifty-one , and was buried in St. Paul 's Cathedral , near the entrance of the north door .

 = Jean-Pierre Minckelers =   
Jean-Pierre or Jan Pieter Minckelers ( also Minkelers , Minckeleers ) ( 1748-1824 ) was a Dutch academic and inventor of coal gasification and illuminating gas .   
 Minckelers was the son of Anna Margaretha Denis en Laurens Michael Minckelers , a pharmacist in Maastricht . After finishing Latin school in his hometown at the age of 15 , he went to the University of Leuven ( French : Louvain ) , where he studied theology and philosophy at the Collegium Falconis . In 1771 he became a deacon and the next year he became professor of natural philosophy . From 1778 Minckelers focussed on the study of gasses . He worked closely with Jan Frans Thijsbaert ( Jean-François Thysbaert ; 1736–1825 ) , director of the school of experimental physics at the university , and it was under Thysbaert 's direction that he did his experiments on coal gas.In the early 1780s the question of aerostats and Montgolfier balloons was occupying the mind of scientists , and Louis Engelbert , 6th Duke of Arenberg , a promoter of science and art , engaged Minckelers , Thysbaert en Carolus van Bochaute , a third natural philosopher at the university , to address the question of the best gas for balloon purposes . In 1784 , after many experiments , Minckelers published a work entitled Mémoire sur l'air inflammable tiré de différentes substances , rédigé par M. Minkelers , professeur de philosophie au collège du Faucon , université de Louvain ( Louvain , 1784 ) . As an appendix to this memoir there was a Table de gravités spécifiques des différentes espèces d'air by Thysbaert .   
 In his memoir Minckelers relates how he made his discovery : from the very beginning of his experiments he had had the idea of enclosing oil in the barrel of a gun and heating it in a forge . Under action of the heat the oil dissolved and gave way to a very light gas , having other advantageous qualities . Having proved that oil gas was the best for balloons , Minckelers used it for many balloons which rose rapidly and travelled great distances in the neighbourhood of Leuven in 1783 . As we learn from his pupil von Hulstein , who was in his class in 1785 , Minckelers at times used this same gas to light his lecture hall . Later on some students ' bedrooms were lit by gas as well . Moreover , the drift of his memoir proves clearly that in its inventor 's eyes the great combustibility of the gas was one of its leading qualities . When Joseph II , in 1788 , transferred the Catholic University of Leuven to Brussels , Minckelers continued as professor . During the Brabant Revolution , Brussels was besieged and Minckelers was forced to flee , leaving his equipment behind . The gaslight apparatus is thought to have survived until World War I . As a supporter of the emperor , he could not regain his position when the University moved back to Leuven . He officially resigned in 1794 and was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the Central School of Maastricht . While not at a center of higher learning , he proceeded to do research , among others on meteorology and on a Mosasaurus skeleton discovered in a local limestone quarry in 1800 .   
 In 1816 he became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands . He retired in 1818 and died six years later in his hometown of Maastricht .   
 Minckelers is remembered as an inventor of coal gasification and gas lighting and as the first to do this at a practical scale . On Maastricht 's market square stands a statue , created by Bart van Hove , that carries an `` eternal '' gas light . For sustainability and budget reasons , the flame is coin operated since 2006 . Another statue of him is in Heverlee near the science buildings of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven . A number of schools and streets in the Netherlands and Belgium carry his name , including a street in the center of Leuven .

 Hartogs main work was in several complex variables where he is known for   
 Hartogs 's theorem , Hartogs 's lemma ( also known as Hartogs 's principle or Hartogs 's extension theorem ) and the concepts of holomorphic hull and domain of holomorphy .   
 In set theory , he contributed to the theory of wellorders and proved what is also known as Hartogs 's theorem : for every set x there is a wellordered set that can not be injectively embedded in x .   
 The smallest such set is known as the Hartogs number or Hartogs Aleph of x .

 = John Berry (zoologist) =   
John Berry , CBE DL FRSE ( 1907-2002 ) was a Scottish zoologist and ecologist . He was the first Director of the Nature Conservancy ( UK ) for Scotland ( 1949 to 1967 ) . He was the youngest and longest served Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh during the 20th century .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born on 5 August 1907 , the son of William Berry of Tayfield , an advocate in Edinburgh . His father instilled in him a love of nature conservation and especially bird protection .   
 His mother died in his early youth and he was largely raised by aunts . He suffered from brittle bones and dyslexia.John was sent to boarding school , being educated at Eton College in England , and then continuing on to Trinity College , Cambridge and then receiving a PhD at St Andrews University . Here he shared accommodation ( and a love of birds ) with Peter Scott , later to become one of Britain ’ s most loved ornithologists . During this time Berry was nicknamed ’ ’ ’ Gooseberry ’ ’ ’ , due to his love and knowledge of geese .   
 In 1936 he married fellow ornithologist , Bride Fremantle .   
 Upon graduation , Berry first found employment at University College , Dundee , researching the biology of fish , then moving to the University of Southampton . Here he came to the attention of Prof D ’ Arcy Thompson and was persuaded to study for a Doctorate at St Andrews University .   
 In 1936 , aged only 29 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh , the youngest Fellow of the 20th century . Having 66 years service in the Society he was also the oldest Fellow and the longest served .   
 In the 1930s he was involved in counter-intelligence work in Germany and Hungary . During the Second World War he was the official Press Censor for Scotland ( 1940–44 ) .   
 During this same period he was commissioned by the Scottish Hydro-Electricity Board to design the Pitlochry fish ladder to allow migrating salmon to circumnavigate the large dam built there . This included viewing galleries for the public as it was realised this strange feature had strong value as a visitor attraction .   
 In October 1948 he represented Britain at the conference establishing the International Union for Conservation of Nature at Fontainbleau in France . Berry was established as Head of Nature Conservation in Scotland immediately thereafter , prior to the legal implementation of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act the next year .   
 In 1951 he declared Beinn Eighe the first Scottish National Nature Reserve . He went on to designate Tentsmuir Forest , Morton Lochs , Loch Leven and the Cairngorms . He also brought about the acquisition of Rùm and St Kilda .   
 In 1969 he was elected Deputy Lieutenant of Fife .   
 In 1970 Dundee University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters ( LLD ) and in 1991 St Andrews University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Science .   
 John Berry died on 19 February 2002 aged 94 . His archives , including papers relating to his work on North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board projects and their environmental impact and several files relating to his work on wildfowl , are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee .

`` Curien '' redirects here . For the fictional insane scientist , see The House of the Dead .   
 Hubert Curien ( 30 October 1924 – 6 February 2005 ) was a French physicist and a key figure in European science politics , as the President of CERN Council ( 1994–1996 ) , the first chairman of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) ( 1981–1984 ) , and second President of the Academia Europæa and a President of Fondation de France .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in Cornimont , Vosges in Lorraine , Curien enlisted in the French resistance during World War II . After the war he studied physics at the École normale supérieure in Paris .   
 Curien became the director general of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ) in 1969 , and was one of the founders of the European Science Foundation and chairman from 1979 to 1984 . He was also head of the French space agency from 1976 to 1984 , and first chairman of the board of ESA from 1981 to 1984 .   
 Curien was the Minister of Research of France from 1984 to 1986 and from 1988 to 1993 . He entered the French Academy of Sciences in 1994.Curien was the President of the Fondation de France from 1998 through 2000 .   
 Two years later , in November 2002 , he retired from CERN after 38 years of contribution to accelerator projects , starting as a fellow in 1964.As a tribute to Curien , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to rename its bilateral scientific exchange programmes , previously referred to as `` Integrated Action Programmes '' or `` PAI '' to `` Hubert Curien Partnerships '' or `` PHC '' . The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has such `` Hubert Curien Partnerships '' with more than 60 countries of the world .   
 The 2004 Forum Engelberg also paid tribute to their President Curien for the occasion of his upcoming 80th birthday.In honor of his contribution to European space , it was decided by ESA , NASA , and the international Committee for Space Research ( COSPAR ) to name the landing site of the Huygens probe after him , and from 14 March 2007 it is known as the `` Hubert Curien Memorial Station '' .His son Pierre-Louis Curien is a noted theoretical computer scientist .

 = Leon Harmon =   
Leon D. Harmon ( 1922 - 1983 ) was a researcher in mental/neural processing , particularly regarding vision , who worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories , Incorporated .   
 Harmon started his career as a radio serviceman and electronics hobbyist . In 1950 , he went to work as a wireman on the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study , where he worked for Julian Bigelow and encountered John von Neumann and Albert Einstein . At the same time he began taking night courses in engineering at New York University . When the IAS project ended in 1956 , he joined Bell Laboratories where he worked on human perception , computer vision and graphics .   
 In 1966 , Harmon and Kenneth C. Knowlton were experimenting with photomosaic , creating large prints from collections of small symbols or images . In Studies in Perception I they created an image of a reclining nude ( the dancer Deborah Hay ) , by scanning a photograph with a camera and converting the analog voltages to binary numbers which were assigned typographic symbols based on halftone densities . It was printed in The New York Times on 11 October 1967 , and exhibited as part of the Experiments in Art and Technology ( EAT ) competition at , The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age , held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City from November 25 , 1968 through February 9 , 1969.Harmon is best known for his highly pixelated , block portrait of Abraham Lincoln from the five dollar bill . It was created to illustrate his November , 1973 , Scientific American article , `` The Recognition of Faces . '' In 1976 , Salvador Dalí used Harmon 's image as the basis of his Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea and Lincoln in Dalivision .   
 Around 1973 , Harmon went to the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University , and became the head of that department . During this time , he conducted studies on facial recognition , as well as robotic control . He supervised one graduate student , Thomas F. Collura , who received his Ph.D. in 1978 for studying brainwave ( EEG ) signatures of attention in human subjects , using an analog computer . Harmon served in the department , having stepped down as head in 1976 to become professor , until his passing in 1982 .

 = George Hudleston Hurlstone Hardy =   
George Hudleston Hurlstone Hardy ( 14 August , 1882 – 9 January , 1966 ) was an entomologist who specialized in the biology of Diptera , especially Asilidae , Muscidae , Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae . He was the eldest son of Matilda Margaret Hudleston and English engineer and amateur entomologist Major George Hurlstone Hardy , who wrote The Book of the Fly . Hardy grew up in the Old House on Park Road in Twickenham and his second cousin was composer William Yeates Hurlstone . Hardy studied engineering at the Northumberland Institute and abandoned his Roman Catholic faith after reading Darwin 's On the Origin of Species .   
 After migrating to Australia in 1911 , Hardy became assistant curator of the Tasmanian Museum , then a fellow in economic entomology at the University of Queensland . His collection , including his types , is shared between the Tasmanian Museum and the Australian Museum . Other collections are in the CSIRO Division of Economic Entomology and the University of Queensland Insect Collection . Hardy collected Diptera of the principle families throughout Australia , including Tasmania . He published notes on Diptera and descriptions of new species in Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania , Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales , The Australian Journal of Zoology , Records of the Australian Museum , Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland , Bulletin of Entomological Research , Annals and Magazine of Natural History and the Entomologist 's Monthly Magazine . The Bishop Museum has a bibliography and many Hardy papers are online at Biodiversity Heritage Library URL .   
 Hardy established the Entomological Society of Queensland in 1923 and was among the founding members of the Australian Entomological Society.He married Tasmanian schoolteacher Martha Elizabeth Olive Harris , who was a nature lover and helped with his work . Hardy named the striking Tasmanian fly Pelecorhynchus olivei in her honour . They had only one child , biologist Margaret Hurlstone Hardy , but sheep geneticist Helen Newton Turner called them her `` second mother and father . ''

 = Sergei Tyablikov =   
Sergei Vladimirovich Tyablikov ( Russian : Серге́й Влади́мирович Тя́бликов ; September 7 , 1921 – March 17 , 1968 ) was a Russian theoretical physicist known for his significant contributions to statistical mechanics , solid-state physics , and for the development of the double-time Green function 's formalism .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Tyablikov was born in Klin , Russia . In 1944 he graduated from the Faculty of Physics at the Moscow State University ( MSU ) and started his postgraduate study with Anatoly Vlasov and later with Nikolay Bogoliubov at the Department of Theoretical Physics . In 1947 he obtained PhD degree ( Candidate of Sciences ) with PhD Thesis on the subject of crystallization theory and was appointed to the Steklov Institute of Mathematics , where he continued to work for the rest of his life .   
 In 1954 he defended at the MSU his doctoral dissertation `` Studies of the Polaron Theory '' and obtained the degree of Doktor nauk ( Doctor of Science , similar to Habilitation ) . Since 1962 he was the Head of the Division of Statistical Mechanics in the Steklov Institute of Mathematics .   
 In the period 1966-1968 , Sergei Tyablikov also worked at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research , where he was the first Head of the Statistical Mechanics and Theory of Condensed Matter Group at the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics .   
    
    
 == Research work ==   
 During postgraduate study in 1944—1947 he worked on theory of crystallization , where he applied such methods as diagonalization of bilinear forms in Bose or Fermi operators , etc. , which later became a common tool for theoretical physicists .   
 After finishing PhD he started to work on the problem of a particle interacting with a quantum field . This problem is directly related to polaron theory , the effect of impurities on the energy spectrum of superfluids , and other problems in condensed matter physics . He was involved in the development of operator form of perturbation theory , approximate second quantization , adiabatic approximation for systems with translational invariance , and other theoretical physics methods which play an important role in the theory of many-particle systems .   
 Since 1948 in collaboration with Nikolay Bogoliubov he started to work on quantum theory of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism . In 1948 they developed a consistent theoretical polar model of metals . Later Tyablikov developed the first consistent quantum theory of magnetic anisotropy .   
 His particularly important contribution to antiferromagnetism was in the development of the method of quantum temperature Green 's functions . In 1959 , Sergei Tyablikov and Nikolay Bogoliubov published the paper which strongly influenced the development of the many-body physics and specifically the quantum theory of magnetism . He also co-authored with V.L . Bonch-Bruevich the book The Green Function Method in Statistical Mechanics , the first book with a consistent exposition of the method of Green 's functions .

 = A. K. Huntington =   
Professor Alfred Kirby Huntington ( 1852–1920 ) was a British professor of metallurgy and aviation pioneer . He flew balloons and made and flew his own aeroplane .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Alfred Kirby Huntington was born on 18 January 1852 in Ipswich , Suffolk to Francis Henry Huntington and Amelia Huntington ( née Hemsworth ) . He had an elder brother , Francis D ’ Esterre Huntington , who was born in 1847 but died aged 10 in 1857 .   
    
    
 == Professional life ==   
 Huntington was Professor of Metallurgy at King ’ s College , University of London .   
 He was trained at the Royal School of Mines under Dr. Percy , leaving it in 1877 as an Associate in Mining and Metallurgy , and proceeded to King 's College , London , where he assisted Professor W. N. Hartley in his researches on ultra-violet absorption spectra . He also assisted Sir William Siemens in his early experiments with the electric arc furnace . When a separate department of Metallurgy was founded at King 's College in 1879 , Huntington was appointed to the chair .   
 He died on 17 April 1920 at his London residence , Buckingham Street , Strand , shortly after relinquishing the chair.He was associated with the Institute of Metals from its foundation , and took an active part in its proceedings down to the time of his death . He became a Vice-President in 1910 , and during the session 1913-14 occupied the Presidential chair , being in office at the Ghent meeting , the first meeting of the Institute to be held abroad .   
 During the first world war Huntington was heavily involved with work for the War Ministry in testing munitions , including testing fracturing of grenades .   
    
    
 == Aeronautics ==   
 Professor Huntington was a founder and active committee member of the Royal Aero Club .   
 He began as a keen balloonist and took part in the first Aero Club race , which took place at Ranelagh Club on 7 July 1906 . His balloon Zenith was one of the seven balloons to ascend that day , the first time in England that seven balloons had ascended from one spot . He also competed in the first Gordon-Bennett Cup race in 1906 along with the Hon . C. S. Rolls.He moved on from balloons to build and fly his own aeroplane , to a design provided by J. W. Dunne . The Dunne-Huntington triplane was an unusual design , variously referred to as a triplane , a biplane or a tandem monoplane . Dunne produced the original design for Huntington during the winter of 1907–1908 . Huntington built it over the next two years and in April 1910 he flew it for the first time , on the Aero Club 's flying ground at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey . Huntington experimented with a number of improvements over the next few years , notably the substitution of a Gnome rotary engine , and it was still flying well into 1914 .   
 Due to the first world war , the aeroplane was dismantled and the framework used to make a rose pergola at the back of the professor 's country house in Yelstead.Huntington is named on the Aviation Memorial at Eastchurch .

 = Nikolay Diletsky =   
Nikolay Diletsky ( Ukrainian : Микола Дилецький , Mykola Dyletsky , Russian : Николай Павлович Дилецкий , Nikolay Pavlovich Diletsky , Nikolai Diletskii , Polish : Mikołaj Dilecki , also Mikolaj Dylecki , Nikolai Dilezki , etc . ; c. 1630 , Kiev – after 1680 , Moscow ) was a music theorist and composer of Ukrainian nationality , active in Russia . He was widely influential in late 17th-century Russia with his treatise on composition , A Musical Grammar , of which the earliest surviving version dates from 1677 . Diletsky 's followers included Vasily Titov .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
 Little is known about Diletsky 's life . A remark by Ioannikii Trofimovich Korenev , a fellow theorist who describes him as a resident of Kiev , is considered evidence of Diletsky 's Ukrainian origins . Korenev 's statement is probably reliable , as he and Diletsky apparently were well acquainted . However , the date and even the year of birth are not known , and no details on Diletsky 's early life have surfaced . He must have moved to Vilnius before 1675 , because that year his Toga zlota ( `` The golden toga '' ) was published there . The text is now lost , but it is known that it was written in Polish , and the surviving title page indicates that it was probably a panegyrical pamphlet . Some sources indicate that he wrote at least one other musical treatise while in Vilnius , which is now lost : this treatise is first mentioned in Grammatika musikiyskago peniya ( 1677 ) , and the Idea grammatikii musikiiskoi ( 1679 ) is described as a translation of the Vilnius work in its title page .   
 After Vilnius , Diletsky lived in Smolensk , where in 1677 the first surviving version of his magnum opus , Grammatika musikiyskago peniya ( `` A grammar of musical song '' ) , was written . He then moved to Moscow , where the subsequent two versions of the work appeared in 1679 and 1681 . Nothing further is known about Diletsky 's life , and it is generally assumed that he died shortly afterwards . His date of birth is projected from this hypothesis .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
    
 Although several of his compositions survive , Diletsky 's fame rests chiefly on his composition treatise , Grammatika musikiyskago peniya ( A Grammar of Music [ al Singing ] ) , which was the first of its kind in Russia . The three surviving versions bear different names , but the content is roughly the same with some important differences . The treatise is in two parts . The first teaches the rudiments of music theory , `` relying heavily on Western terminology and theoretical precepts , especially the hexachord '' , and the second teaches composition of a cappella concertos , a genre that came to Russia through Ukraine and of which Diletsky was one of the first exponents . Diletsky provides a wide variety of examples , both from his own work , including an 8-voice setting of the Divine Liturgy that he composed in Smolensk specifically to illustrate the Grammatika , and from that of contemporary Western composers , particularly the Poles Marcin Mielczewski and Jacek Rózycki . Apart from the tremendous influence it had on subsequent generations of Russian church composers , the Grammatika is of particular interest for having the first known description of the circle of fifths , one that antedates Western examples by several decades .

Gunsalus was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1949 for his work on intermediary metabolism of microorganisms.In 1950 , he took a faculty position as professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , shifting his speciality in 1955 to head the biochemistry department until 1966 . While there , he co-authored The Bacteria : A Treatise on Structure and Function with Roger Y. Stanier , a five-volume work that served as a basic textbook for scientists entering the field.In the 1950s , while studying Enterococcus , a lactic acid bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract , Gunsalus discovered various forms of lipoic acid , as well as pyridoxal phosphate , an active form of vitamin B6 , and was granted a patent in 1962 on lipoic acid . In further research , he discovered the role that lipoic acid plays in metabolism , allowing for the more effective use of carbohydrates in the diet . By the 1970s , other researchers and hospitals had begun to use lipoic acid for the treatment of chronic liver disease . It has since been used experimentally to treat pancreatic cancer and its use as a dietary supplement to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease has been proposed.During the 1960s and 1970s , Gunsalus studied Cytochrome P450 , researching its role in metabolism in the human liver . His studies led to an understanding of how the family of P-450 proteins and their role in metabolizing natural and man-made compounds.He also researched the way that soil microbes exchange plasmids , giving the organisms the ability to adapt to differing nutritional substances available in their environment . Gunsalus was a postdoctoral advisor to Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty , who later used genetic engineering techniques for plasmid transfer to create microbes that could digest petroleum.In February 1967 , Gunsalus was one of four scientists who delivered to President Lyndon B. Johnson a petition that had been signed by more than 5,000 scientists demanding an end to the use of biological and chemical weapons in Vietnam . The petition included 17 Nobel Prize-winners and 127 members of the National Academy of Sciences .   
    
    
 == Post-academic career ==   
 After retiring from the University of Illinois in 1982 , Gunsalus was named the founding director of the United Nations International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology , which is responsible for increasing international cooperation in the development and use of genetic engineering and biotechnology in issues related to development . He oversaw the establishment of research centers in Trieste , Italy and in New Delhi , India . He was later chosen to conduct ecological studies of the Gulf of Mexico for the United States Environmental Protection Agency from 1993 to 2003 , where he studied methods for microbiological bioremediation of coastal ecosystems.Gunsalus was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , the American Academy of Microbiology . He was also elected to the National Academy of Sciences , where he served as the chairman of the biochemistry section from 1978 to 1981 . He was the founding editor of the journal Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications . In 1982 he was the recipient of the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology from the National Academy of Sciences.Gunsalus died at age 96 on October 25 , 2008 at his home in Andalusia , Alabama of congestive heart failure .

Joanna Charlotte Davy née Flemmich was an English plant collector and painter . She was a well-known figure in British botanical circles in the first half of the twentieth century and was active in various societies including the Botanical Society of the British Isles which made her an honorary member in 1950 . During this period she was generally known as Lady Davy or , on formal records , Johanna Charlotte Davy .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Born in London in February 1865 to Charlotte and John Flemmich , a merchant , she grew up in Roehampton . After marrying James Stewart Davy ( 1848-1915 ) in 1886 she lived most of her life in Sussex and Surrey . Her husband was a civil servant involved in poor law administration who was knighted in 1902 . They had two children .   
    
    
 == Field botany ==   
 Her serious interest in British flora developed after moving to Copyhold near Cuckfield in 1893 . The botanist G. Claridge Druce became a friend and frequent visitor with whom Davy explored the countryside around her home , contributing numerous finds to records of Sussex flora . In 1899 she joined the Wild Flower Society which increased her interest and contacts with other plant enthusiasts . She lived in Pyrford from 1909 before moving to West Byfleet in 1922 where she kept `` open house '' for botanists of different ages and levels of experience . She was a regular contributor to records of Surrey flora.She travelled across the British Isles on plant-hunting expeditions in groups which she sometimes led . On a trip to Scotland with Gertrude Bacon , they discovered Carex microglochin , never before found growing in the UK . Some of her plant specimens are now in the J. E. Lousley herbarium at Reading University , and others at Oxford University and Kew Gardens . The Natural History Museum , London has 48 watercolours of orchids by Davy in their collection .

John Aikin ( 15 January 1747 – 7 December 1822 ) was an English doctor and writer .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born at Kibworth Harcourt , Leicestershire , England , son of Dr. John Aikin , Unitarian divine , and received his elementary education at the Nonconformist academy at Warrington , where his father was a tutor . He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh , and in London under Dr. William Hunter . He practised as a surgeon at Chester and Warrington . Finally , he went to Leiden in Holland , earned an M.D . ( 1780 ) , and in 1784 established himself as a doctor in Great Yarmouth.In 1792 , one of his pamphlets having given offence , he moved to London , where he practised as a consulting physician . However , he concerned himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his professional duties , and he began at an early period to devote himself to literary pursuits , to which his contributions were incessant . When Richard Phillips founded The Monthly Magazine in 1796 , Aikin was its first editor . In conjunction with his sister , Anna Laetitia Barbauld , he published a popular series of volumes entitled Evenings at Home ( 6 vols , 1792–1795 ) , for elementary family reading , which were translated into almost every European language .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 In 1798 Aikin retired from medicine and devoted himself with great industry to various literary undertakings , among which his General Biography ( 10 vols , 1799–1815 ) holds a conspicuous place . His other works included Biographical Memoirs of Medicine in Great Britain ( 1780 ) and The Lives of John Selden , Esq. , and Archbishop Usher ( 1812 ) . Aside from editing The Monthly Magazine from 1796 to 1807 and Dodsley 's Annual Register from 1811 to 1815 , he produced a paper called The Athenaeum 1807 to 1809 , not to be confused with the The Athenaeum , a well-known British magazine published from 1828 to 1921 .   
    
    
 == Family ==   
 Aikin had four children , three sons and a daughter . The eldest son , Arthur , was a prominent scientist , and the youngest , Edmund , an architect . The second son , Charles , was adopted by Aikin 's sister , who had no children of her own . Through Charles , Aikin was grandfather to the writer Anna Letitia Le Breton . His daughter Lucy was a biographer , who in 1823 published her Memoir of John Aikin , M.D. , with a selection of Miscellaneous Pieces , Biographical , Moral and Critical .

 with N > 1 is when N = 24 and M = 70 . This is known as the cannonball problem , since it can be visualized as the problem of taking a square arrangement of cannonballs on the ground and building a square pyramid out of them . It was not until 1918 that a proof ( using elliptic functions ) was found for this remarkable fact , which has relevance to the bosonic string theory in 26 dimensions . More recently , elementary proofs have been published.He devised methods for testing the primality of numbers . In 1857 , at age 15 , Lucas began testing the primality of 2127 − 1 by hand , using Lucas sequences . In 1876 , after 19 years of testing , he finally proved that 2127 − 1 was prime ; this would remain the largest known Mersenne prime for three-quarters of a century . This may stand forever as the largest prime number proven by hand . Later Derrick Henry Lehmer refined Lucas 's primality tests and obtained the Lucas–Lehmer primality test .   
 He worked on the development of the umbral calculus .   
 Lucas was also interested in recreational mathematics . He found an elegant binary solution to the Baguenaudier puzzle . He also invented the Tower of Hanoi puzzle , which he marketed under the nickname N. Claus de Siam , an anagram of Lucas d'Amiens , and published for the first time a description of the Dots and Boxes game in 1889 .   
 Lucas died in unusual circumstances . At the banquet of the annual congress of the Association française pour l'avancement des sciences , a waiter dropped some crockery and a piece of broken plate cut Lucas on the cheek . He died a few days later of a severe skin inflammation probably caused by sepsis . He was only 49 years old .

He obtained a doctorate from the University of Göttingen in 1888 , and from 1900 to 1913 he was professor of theoretical physics at the University of Heidelberg .   
 In 1893 he discovered that a steady electric field applied to certain birefringent materials causes the refractive index to vary , approximately in proportion to the strength of the field . The coefficient of proportionality is of the order of 10×10−10 V−1 to 10×10−12 V−1 . This phenomenon is now called the Pockels effect .

 He studied medicine at the University of Freiburg , where one of his instructors was orthopedist Louis Stromeyer ( 1804–1876 ) . He furthered his medical training in Vienna with Carl Rokitansky ( 1804–1878 ) , Joseph Hyrtl ( 1810–1894 ) and Josef Skoda ( 1805–1881 ) , and in Würzburg under Rudolf Virchow ( 1821–1902 ) . Afterwards , he returned to Freiburg , where in 1859 he became an associate professor . He later attained a full professorship , and in 1864 founded the first institute of pathological anatomy at Freiburg .   
 With Adolf Kussmaul ( 1822–1902 ) , Maier provided the first comprehensive description of periarteritis nodosa , a condition sometimes referred to as `` Kussmaul-Maier disease '' . The two doctors described their findings in the inaugural edition of the journal Deutsches Archiv für klinische Medicin , a publication co-founded by Friedrich Albert von Zenker ( 1825–1898 ) and Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen ( 1829–1902 ) .   
 He died in 1888 following a massive goiter disease with bronchoconstriction .

She subsequently worked as a programmer at English Electric .   
    
    
 == Career and research ==   
 Kahn joined the Computer Science Department at the University of Manchester in 1967 , appointed as an assistant lecturer based on her ability to teach COBOL . She has been cited as an example of how women with non-traditional backgrounds could enter early academic computer science by offering unusual specialised skills . Although Kahn never pursued a PhD , she was a faculty member who supervised a number of PhD students ; during her tenure she started the computer-aided design ( CAD ) group at Manchester , worked on the Manchester MU5 computer , and was extensively involved in standards development , most notably for the EDIF project . She collaborated with Tom Kilburn and wrote published several obituaries on him . Kahn was also active in preserving the history of early computing at Manchester and organised a large-scale celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Manchester Baby , the first stored-program computer , which was completed in 1948 . Kahn retired from her faculty position in 2006 .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Kahn 's husband Brian Napper was also a Manchester faculty member . The couple had one child , a daughter , born in 1977 . Kahn died in 2007 .

 = Tor Bergeron =   
Tor Bergeron ( 15 August 1891 – 13 June 1977 ) was a Swedish meteorologist who proposed a mechanism for the formation of precipitation in clouds . In the 1930s , Bergeron and W. Findeisen developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals . According to Bergeron , most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals , which then fall as snow , or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature . This process is known as the Bergeron Process , and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed .   
 Bergeron was one of the principal scientists in the Bergen School of Meteorology , which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather . While developing innovative methods of forecasting , the Bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth , growth , and decay . Bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process , which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone .   
 In 1949 he was awarded the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society .   
 In 1966 he was awarded the prestigious International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization .

 = Joseph Henri Marie de Pr C3 A9mare =   
Joseph Henri Marie de Prémare ( 17 July 1666 – 17 September 1736 ) was a Jesuit missionary to China . Born in Cherbourg , he departed for China in 1698 , and worked as a missionary in Guangxi .   
 In 1724 , after the Yongzheng Emperor virtually banned Christianity over the Chinese Rites controversy , he was confined with his colleagues in Guangzhou and later banished to Macau , where he died .   
 His Notitia linguae sinicae , written in 1736 and first published in 1831 , was the first important Chinese language grammar in a European language . His letters can be found in the Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine series.Father de Prémare is among the missionaries who furnished Jean-Baptiste Du Halde with the material for his `` Description de la Chine '' ( Paris , 1735 ) . Among his contributions were translations from the Book of Documents ( Du Halde , II , 298 ) ; eight odes of the Classic of Poetry ( II , 308 ) ; and the first translation into a European language of a Chinese drama , `` The Orphan of Zhao '' ( III , 341 ) , titled L'Orphelin de la Maison de Tchao . Premaré sent the translation to Étienne Fourmont , a member of the Académie française . However , the play came into the possession of Father Du Halde instead , who published it in his Description Géographique , Historique , Chronologique , Politique et Physique de l'Empire de la Chine et de la Tartarie Chinois in 1735 , although he had no permission from Prémare or Fourmont to do so . Prémare 's translation inspired Voltaire 's 1753 tragedy L'Orphelin de la Chine.De Prémare 's writings also include a defense of figurism proposed by Joachim Bouvet , which held that the doctrines of Christianity were mystically embodied in the Chinese classics .

 = Walter Rosenhain =   
Dr. Walter Rosenhain ForMemRS ( 24 August 1875 – 17 March 1934 ) was a German-born Australian metallurgist .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Rosenhain was born in Berlin , German Empire , the son of Moritz Rosenhain , a merchant , and his wife Friederike , a daughter of Rabbi Benjamin Yosman Fink . The family migrated to Australia when Walter , was five years old , to avoid him having to do military service . He was educated at Wesley College , Melbourne , and Queen 's College , University of Melbourne , where he completed his course in civil engineering and was awarded an 1851 exhibition . Rosenhain then did three years research work with Professor James Alfred Ewing at St John 's College , Cambridge .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 On the advice of his professor he took up the microscopic examination of metals , and spent some time at the Royal Mint studying the technique of his new work . This led to the discovery of `` slip bands '' and later , the phenomenon of spontaneous annealing in lead and other soft metals . In 1900 he became scientific adviser to Chance Brothers of Birmingham , glass manufacturers and lighthouse engineers , and for the next six years his work was chiefly concerned with the production of optical glass and lighthouse apparatus .   
 In 1906 Rosenhain became the first superintendent of the department of metallurgy and metallurgical chemistry at the National Physical Laboratory , he held this position until 1931 . His department was initially a small one , but grew quickly and eventually became one of the most important metallurgical research laboratories in the world . Rosenhain published a large number of papers and addresses , and his highly trained staff also did much writing , covering the whole field of physical metallurgy , ferrous and non-ferrous . In 1908 Rosenhain published his book on Glass Manufacture , a second edition of which , largely re-written , appeared in 1919 . Another volume was published in 1914 , An Introduction to the Study of Physical Metallurgy , 2nd edition 1916 , frequently reprinted . A third edition , revised and partly rewritten by John L. Haughton , was published after Rosenhain 's death , in 1935 . Towards the end of 1915 he delivered the Cantor lectures on optical glass before the Royal Society of Arts . These lectures were published as a pamphlet in 1916 . In the following year he wrote the essay on `` The Modern Science of Metals '' for Science and the Nation , Essays by Cambridge Graduates . In 1927 he was appointed British delegate on the permanent committee of the International Association for Testing Materials , and was elected its president at the Zurich congress held in 1931 . Rosenhain was a good linguist and gave lectures and addresses in many countries . He resigned his position at the National Physical Laboratory in 1931 to take up practice in London as a consulting metallurgist .   
 He was president of the Institute of the Optical Society and of the Institute of Metals . Rosenhain was Carnegie silver medallist in 1906 and Bessemer medallist of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1930 . He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1913 and jointly delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1899.In 1901 , he married Louise , sister of Sir John Monash . He died of cancer in Surrey on 17 March 1934 . His wife and two daughters survived him .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Rosenhain was a man of strong personality , clear in exposition and an inspiring team leader . He did remarkable work with light alloys , on the mechanism of crystallisation , the mechanical deformation of metals , and the improvement of technical practice . His many papers were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London , the Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute , and other technical journals . With P. A. Tucker he published in 1908 a volume on The Alloys of Lead and Tin , and in 1911 , with S. L. Archbutt , one on The Constitution of the Alloys of Aluminium and Zinc .   
 The Rosenhain award of the Iron and Steel Institute was created in 1984 .

 ; stating the famous Catalan 's conjecture , which was eventually proved in 2002 ; and , introducing the Catalan numbers to solve a combinatorial problem .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Catalan was born in Bruges ( now in Belgium , then under Dutch rule even though the Kingdom of the Netherlands had not yet been formally instituted ) , the only child of a French jeweller by the name of Joseph Catalan , in 1814 . In 1825 , he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at École Polytechnique , where he met Joseph Liouville ( 1833 ) . In December 1834 he was expelled along with most of the students in his year for political reasons ; he resumed his studies in January 1835 , graduated that summer , and went on to teach at Châlons-sur-Marne . Catalan came back to the École Polytechnique , and , with the help of Liouville , obtained his degree in mathematics in 1841 . He went on to Charlemagne College to teach descriptive geometry . Though he was politically active and strongly left-wing , leading him to participate in the 1848 Revolution , he had an animated career and also sat in the France 's Chamber of Deputies . Later , in 1849 , Catalan was visited at his home by the French Police , searching for illicit teaching material ; however , none was found .   
 The University of Liège appointed him chair of analysis in 1865 . In 1879 , still in Belgium , he became journal editor where he published as a foot note Paul-Jean Busschop 's theory after refusing it in 1873 - letting Busschop know that it was too empirical . In 1883 , he worked for the Belgian Academy of Science in the field of number theory . He died in Liège , Belgium where he had received a chair .

 = Eloise Gerry =   
Eloise Gerry ( January 12 , 1885 – 1970 ) was an influential research scientist whose early 20th century work contributed greatly to the study of southern pine trees and turpentine production . Gerry was the first woman appointed to the professional staff of the U.S. Forest Service at the Forest Products Laboratory , and one of the first women in the United States to specialize in forest products research .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Eloise Gerry was born January 12 , 1885 in Boston , Massachusetts . She received both bachelor 's and master 's degrees from Harvard University 's Radcliffe College , where she specialized in the anatomy of wood and trees and their physiological responses . She was first hired as a research scientist by the U.S. Forest Service in 1910 . On April 28 , 1914 she addressed the members of the Northern Hemlock and Hardwood Manufacturers Association , at the Forest products laboratory . Her address was titled `` The Structure of Wood and Some of its Properties and Uses . '' While working at the new Forest Products Laboratory ( FPL ) in Madison , Wisconsin , Gerry would also go on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1921 . Her dissertation , based on her research at the FPL , was titled `` Oleoresin Production : A Microscopic Study of the Effects Produced on Woody tissues of Southern Pines by Different Methods of Turpentining . ''   
 Gerry 's research in the area of southern pines and turpentining proved to be her most influential efforts . Working in Mississippi , Gerry performed pioneering work in microscopical studies of the anatomy of resin-yielding pines , and successfully developed methods to increase yield as well as prolong the working life of trees . She worked toward developing best methods stating , `` The microscope reveals many secrets concerning the activities of the tree in producing turpentine and gives these results more quickly than experimental methods alone . '' Based on her field-based research , Gerry was able to develop a program of `` More turpentine , less scar , better pine '' that many later attributed as a savior for the struggling industry .   
    
 During World War II , Gerry wrote FPL wartime publications on defects in wood used for trainer aircraft and gliders . After the war she worked in the area of research on foreign woods . Following 44 years with the U.S. Forest Service , Gerry retired in 1954 . Gerry died in 1970 at the age of 85 .

Eugeniusz Mikołaj Romer ( 3 February 1871 in Lwów ( Lviv , Lemberg ) – 28 January 1954 ) was a distinguished Polish geographer , cartographer and geopolitician , whose maps and atlases are still highly valued by experts .   
 Born in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire , he graduated from a high school in Nowy Sącz and studied history , geology , geography and meteorology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków , also attending courses in Lwów and Halle ( Saale ) . In 1894 , Romer earned a doctorate in philosophy at Lwów University . He was a president of Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists ( 1910–11 ) .   
 In final years of the 19th century , he went to Vienna and Berlin to broaden his knowledge of glaciology , geology and meteorology . Romer also went to Lausanne , to study tectonics and morphology . In 1911 he became professor of Lwów University ( in 1946 also of Jagiellonian University ) , later he was named professor honoris causa at the universities in Lwów , Poznań and Kraków . In 1952 he became a member of Polish Academy of Sciences   
    
 In 1909 Romer went to Switzerland , to study Alpine glaciers . Next year , he traveled to Asia , and in 1913 to Alaska , to the Saint Elias Mountains ( where one of glaciers has been named after him ) . In 1916 , while in Vienna , Romer started work on the Great Statistical and Geographical Atlas of Poland . This atlas , published in Vienna in 1916 , was crucial to establishing borders of the Second Polish Republic . He was a member of the Polish delegation at the Paris Peace Conference , 1919 , helping to draw the western border of Poland . A second edition of his atlas was published in Lwów and Warsaw in 1921 .   
 In 1921 in Lwów Romer founded Cartigraphical Institute Ksiaznica-Atlas , which was moved to Wrocław after World War II . It still exists today . In 1929 he retired , concentrating his activities on the Institute . However , he kept close ties with Lwów 's Jan Kazimierz University , lecturing and examining .   
 In 1941 , when Lwów was captured by the Germans , he hid in a monastery at Piekarska Street , and this decision probably saved his life . Soon after , the Home Army decided to move him to Warsaw , from where he was to be transferred to England to work as an advisor of the Polish Government-in-Exile . However , doctors recommended that Romer should stay in the occupied country , as the journey was too risky for his weak health . Thus , he remained in Warsaw , using the false name Edmund Piotrowski . Romer survived the Warsaw Uprising and a camp in Pruszków .   
 After the war , he settled in Kraków , taking post of director of Department of Geography at the Jagiellonian University . Since 1899 , he had been married to Jadwiga Rossknecht , daughter of co-owner of the Okocim Brewery . They had two sons : Witold Romer ( 1900–1967 ) , professor of the Wrocław University of Technology and Edmund Romer ( 1904–1988 ) , professor of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice .   
 Eugeniusz Romer died 1954 in Kraków and was buried at the Salwator Cemetery .

She took over the position of dance instructor , teaching ballet and Swedish gymnastics for the next three years . In 1923 , she was hired as dance instructor at Kansas State Teachers College . Hill taught there for three years , moving to New York City in 1926 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 After arriving in New York , she studied with various dance teachers ; one of note was Martha Graham who would have a lasting impact on Hill . She was hired in 1927 as Assistant Professor of Dance at the University of Oregon where Bessie Schonberg was one of Hill 's student .   
 By 1929 , Hill had saved up enough money to move back to New York . She joined the Martha Graham Dance Company , completed a BS degree from Teachers College , Columbia University , and began teaching high school students at the Lincoln School of Teachers College . She was hired to teach at New York University in the Physical Education Department of the School of Education in 1930 , soon becoming Director of Dance . Hill reluctantly left the Martha Graham Dance Company in 1931 because of an increasing teaching schedule . In 1932 , Hill was hired by the brand new Bennington College in Bennington , VT , as Chairman of the Dance Department . She held the positions at NYU and Bennington College simultaneously until 1951 .   
 In the summer of 1934 , Hill initiated a summer dance festival on the Bennington College campus , named the `` Bennington School of the Dance '' , which ran until 1942 , with a brief interlude at Mills College in 1939 . Doris Humphrey , Martha Graham , Charles Weidman , and Hanya Holm were key faculty members .   
 Hill received her master 's degree from New York University in 1941 . In 1948 she formed a School of the Dance at Connecticut College calling it the `` Connecticut College School of the Dance '' . The new summer festival employed many of the same teachers/choreographers from the Bennington festival . Hill was a co-director of the festival until 1952 . The festival was later renamed the American Dance Festival and is currently housed at Duke University in North Carolina .   
 In 1951 , William Schuman , president of The Juilliard School , hired Hill to be the first Director of Dance . Schuman and Hill had the bold new concept of creating a training ground for dancers that would be equally split between ballet and modern dance .   
 Hill married Dr. Thurston Davies in 1952 . Davies died in 1961 .   
 Hill remained the director of dance at Juilliard until 1985 , training generations of dancers to the highest level of technique and artistry . Her students included Paul Taylor , Muriel Topaz , Pina Bausch , Daniel Lewis , Lar Lubovitch , Dennis Nahat , Linda Kent , Bruce Marks , Mercedes Ellington , H.T . Chen , Martha Clarke , Susan Marshall , Jenny Coogan , Robert Garland , Mark Haim , Henning Rübsam , Vernon Scott and Stanley Love . Hill was named Artistic Director Emeritus in 1985 , but continued to teach at Juilliard for several years .

 = Judah Leon Templo =   
Jacob Judah Leon Templo ( 1603 – after 1675 ) was a Jewish Dutch scholar , translator of the Psalms , and expert on heraldry , of Sephardic descent .   
 He was son of Abraham de Leon . He became ḥakam in Middelburg and , after 1643 , in Amsterdam , where he was engaged also as teacher in the Talmud Torah . He vocalized the entire Mishnah which was printed in 1646 at the establishment of Manasseh ben Israel , with the anonymous collaboration of Adam Boreel .   
 Jacob caused a great stir by a plan , drawn by him , of Solomon 's Temple . It was exhibited before Charles II of England . The author published a short , comprehensive description in Spanish entitled Retrato del Templo de Selomoh . ( Middelburg , 1642 ) . This was translated into Dutch in the same year ; into French in 1643 ; and by himself into Hebrew in 1650 , with the title Tabnit Hekal . Duke August of Brunswick , and more particularly his wife Elizabeth , wished a German translation of this description and entrusted the task to Johann Saubert of Helmstädt . Someone else published such a translation in 1665 , and Saubert therefore wrote a Latin translation in that year . An English version appeared in 1778 , done by Moses Pereira de Castro , his great grand son , the son of Isaac Pereira de Castro and Lea DeLeon , the daughter of his son Abraham , and in whose possession the plan was then held .   
 In 1647 Jacob wrote Tratado de la Arca del Testamento ( Amsterdam , 1653 ) . His treatise on the cherubim , their form and nature , written in Latin in 1647 , appeared in Spanish under the title Tratado de los Cherubim ( Amsterdam , 1654 ) ; and his description of Moses ' tabernacle , written in 1647 in Dutch , was published under the title Retrato del Tabernaculo de Moseh ( Amsterdam , 1654 ) , and in English ( 1675 ) . His last work was a Spanish paraphrase of the Psalms , which was printed with the text , under the title Las Alabanças de Santitad ( Amsterdam , 1671 ) , and , as is stated in the introduction , was written in seven months . The work was dedicated to Isaac Senior Teixéyra , financial agent , in Hamburg , of Queen Christina of Sweden , and was praised by many ḥakamim , scholars , and poets in Hebrew , Latin , and Spanish verses .   
 Jacob wrote also a dialogue ( Colloquium Middelburgense ) between a rabbi and a Christian scholar on the value of the Christian dogmas ; and he left in manuscript Disputaciones con Diferentes Theologos de la Cristiandad .   
 He was a skilful draftsman . The coat of arms of the English Grand Lodge of Masons with the motto , now `` Holiness to the Lord , '' is the work of the `` famous and learned Hebrewist , architect , and brother , Rabi Jacob Jehudah Leon . '' He drew also more than 200 figures and vignettes to illustrate Talmudical subjects , which his son Solomon gave to Surenhusius for his Latin translation of the Mishnah .

 = Thomas Blakiston =   
Thomas Wright Blakiston ( 27 December 1832 – 15 October 1891 ) was an English explorer and naturalist .   
 Born in Lymington , Hampshire , Blakiston was the son of Major John Blakiston , second son of Sir Matthew Blakiston , 2nd Baronet ( see Blakiston baronets for earlier history of the family ) . His mother was Jane , daughter of Reverend Thomas Wright , Rector of Market Bosworth , Leicestershire . Blakiston explored western Canada with the Palliser Expedition between 1857 and 1859 . Mount Blakiston , the highest point in Waterton Lakes National Park was named for him in 1858 . In 1861 he traveled up the Yangtze River in China , going further than any Westerner before him . He spent the next part of his life in Japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country . He moved to the United States in 1885 . Blakiston died aged 58 of pneumonia in October 1891 while in San Diego , California and is buried in Greenlawn Cemetery , Columbus , Ohio .   
 Blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in Hokkaidō , Japan 's northern island , were related to northern Asian species , whereas those on Honshū to the south were related to those from southern Asia . The Tsugaru Strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary , and became known as `` Blakiston 's Line '' .   
 Blakiston collected an owl specimen in Hakodate , Japan in 1883 . This was later described by Henry Seebohm and named Blakiston 's fish owl .   
 Blakiston married Ann Mary in 1885 . She was the daughter of James Dun and the sister of Edwin Dun . They had one daughter and one son . Ann Mary survived him by 46 years and died in England in March 1937 .

 = Karl M C3 B6bius =   
Karl August Möbius ( 7 February 1825 in Eilenburg – 26 April 1908 in Berlin ) was a German zoologist who was a pioneer in the field of ecology and a former director of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Möbius was born in Eilenburg in Saxony . At the age of four he attended primary school at the Bergschule Eilenburg , and at the age of 12 he was sent by his father to train as a teacher . In 1844 he passed the exams with distinction and began working as teacher in Seesen , on the northwest edge of the Harz mountain range . In 1849 he began studying natural science and philosophy at Natural History Museum of Berlin . After he graduated , he taught zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , physics , and chemistry at the Johanneum High School in Hamburg .   
    
    
 == Oysters and ecology ==   
 In 1863 he opened the first German sea water aquarium , in Hamburg . In 1868 , shortly after passing his doctoral examination at the University of Halle , he was appointed Professor of Zoology at the University of Kiel and the director of the Zoological Museum . Marine animals were among his main research interests and his first comprehensive work on the fauna of the Kieler Bucht already emphasized ecological aspects ( Die Fauna der Kieler Bucht , co-authored by Heinrich Adolph Meyer , and published in two volumes in 1865 and 1872 , respectively ) .   
 Between 1868 and 1870 , Möbius was commissioned by the Ministry of Agricultural Affairs in Prussia to conduct research on the Bay of Kiel oyster beds . At the time , the oysters were being gathered from the natural beds and sold at expensive prices to the wealthy elite . Once the railroad was constructed and more opportunities for exportation arose , the demand for the oysters grew exponentially . In turn , the Ministry tasked Möbius with exploring the potential for further exploitation of the beds . Möbius 's research resulted in two landmark publications : Über Austern- und Miesmuschelzucht und Hebung derselben an der norddeutschen Küste ( 1870 , in English : On oyster and blue mussel farming in coastal areas of Northern Germany ) , and Die Auster und die Austernwirtschaft ( in English : Oyster and oyster farming ) , in which he concluded that oyster farming was not a realistic option for Northern Germany . More importantly , he was first to describe in detail the interactions between the different organisms in the ecosystem of the oyster bank , coining the term `` biocenose '' . This remains a key term in synecology ( community ecology ) .   
 In 1888 Möbius became the director of the Zoological Collections of the Natural History Museum of Berlin , and Professor of Systematic and Geographical Zoology at the Kaiser Wilhelm University , Berlin , where he taught until he retired in 1905 , at the age of 80 .

 = Friedrich Oskar Giesel =   
Friedrich Oskar Giesel ( 20 May 1852 – 13 November 1927 , known as Fritz ) was a German organic chemist . During his work in a quinine factory in the late 1890s he started to work on the at-that-time-new field of radiochemistry and started the production of radium . In the period between 1902 and 1904 he was able to isolate a new element emanium . In a now controversially reviewed process it was stated that emanium is identical to actinium , which was discovered by André-Louis Debierne in 1899 .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 After studying in Berlin with Carl Liebermann he received his Ph.D at the University of Göttingen . Giesel worked at the Chininfabrik Braunschweig . Besides his work in the factory , Giesel 's focus was on radiochemistry . Shortly after publication of the discovery of polonium in the summer of 1898 , he started to isolate the new element from the waste of uranium production in the chemical plant E. de Haën in Hanover . By March 1899 he could present the first radium to the chemical society of Braunschweig and by mid-1899 he published his results on radium . Giesel improved the separation of radium from barium by using the bromides instead of the chlorides for the fractional crystallization . He produced large quantities of pure radium and polonium for commercial applications from uranium ore . Even William Ramsay and Frederick Soddy were buying radium from the factory of Giesel .   
    
 What I have since dubbed the Isenthal 'manna ' was in fact the first consignment of pure radium compounds that Giesel of the Chinin Fabrik of Brunswick was putting on the market and the price I paid for it was about eight shillings a milligram of radium bromide ( 50 per cent pure radium ) .   
    
 The use of Sidot 's blende ( zinc sulfide ) instead of barium platinocyanide as a luminescence material to make the radioactive rays visible was a commonly accepted improvement . He did several self-experiments with radioactive substances and was able to affirm the damaging effects of radioactive radiation on skin . Because of prolonged contact with radioactive material , fingers of his right hand had to be amputated and he suffered from lung cancer . He died of lung cancer in 1927 . His name was included on the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected in Hamburg , Germany in 1936 .   
    
    
 === The discovery of emanium ===   
 Giesel isolated from pitchblende a lanthanum-containing fraction which showed unique properties . He produced several compounds of the new element , and after studying for two years he was confident enough to give the new element the name emanium . He was aware of the discovery of actinium by André-Louis Debierne . In publications from 1899 and 1890 Debierne does not give the exact procedures to obtain actinium , but from the description of chemical properties which he described as similar to titanium ( 1899 ) or similar to thorium ( 1890 ) it was clear for Giesel that the two elements must be different . A later comparison of the two elements by Otto Hahn , Otto Sackur and others showed that the two elements were identical . Debierne 's name was retained because it had seniority.Giesel stated in one of his publications that the sample Debierne provided for the comparison was a lanthanum fraction obtained by the same process he used and not the titanium or thorium fractions from earlier publications . This fact never led to an open controversy but the history of the discovery stayed questionable , and publications from 1971 argue that the claims of André-Louis Debierne in 1904 conflict with the publications in 1899 and 1890 , making Giesel the real discoverer of actinium .   
 A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff . He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the nascent state of radiochemistry , highlights the prudence of Debierne 's claims in the original papers , and notes that nobody can contend that Debierne 's substance did not contain actinium . Debierne , who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer , lost interest in the element and left the topic . Giesel , on the other hand , can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89 .

Angelo Benedetto Traina ( January 22 , 1889 - November 4 , 1971 ) , also known as A . B. Traina , was a biblical scholar , best known for his emphasis on restoring `` Semitic proper names to their Aramaic and Hebrew forms '' .   
 Traina was born in Sicily into a Catholic family . They later moved to New York City , where he left home at the age of 13 , ending up in Buffalo . Part of a group of drinking and gambling youths , he was part of a conspiracy to disrupt a revival meeting , but instead converted , joining a Protestant church . He later worked for Aimee Semple McPherson .   
 His biblical studies resulted in his translating The Sacred Name New Testament ( 1950 ) , with C. O. Dodd , the first example of a sacred name Bible . He went on to translate the Hebrew and Aramaic scriptures also , in The Holy Name Bible containing the Holy Name Version of the Old and New Testaments ( 1963 ) . A fifth edition was published in 1989 by the Scripture Research Association , based in New Jersey and founded by him .   
 He also wrote many pamphlets and articles , many of which were published in the magazine The Faith . Traina was one of the early figures in the Sacred Name Movement , having been a featured speaker at the 1938 Feast of Tabernacles Camp Meeting near Warrior , Alabama , an event which is seen by some as the launching of the movement .

Reinhard Bendix ( February 25 , 1916 – February 28 , 1991 ) was a German American sociologist .   
 Born in Berlin , Germany , he briefly belonged to Neu beginnen and Hashomer Hatzair , groups that resisted the Nazis . In 1938 he emigrated to the United States . He received his B.S. , M.A. , and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago , and subsequently taught there from 1943 to 1946 . He then taught for a year in the Sociology Department of the University of Colorado before moving to the Department of Sociology at the University of California , Berkeley , in 1947 where he remained for the rest of his career .   
 In 1969 Bendix was elected President of the American Sociological Association . From 1968 to 1970 he served as Director of the University of California Education Abroad Program in Göttingen , Germany . In 1972 he joined the Department of Political Science at Berkeley .   
 He held guest professorships at numerous universities , including at Columbia University , St. Catherine 's and Nuffield Colleges at the University of Oxford , the Free University of Berlin , the University of Constance , Hebrew University in Jerusalem , and the University of Heidelberg .   
 In the course of his lifetime , he received many honors , including fellowships from the Fulbright Program and the Guggenheim , a grant from the Carnegie Corporation , as well as being named a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study , and was accepted into both the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin . He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969 . Bendix was also a member of the American Philosophical Society and received honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds , Mannheim , and Göttingen .   
 Bendix , who was deeply devoted to teaching , died in 1991 of a heart attack shortly after conducting a graduate seminar together with a young colleague .   
 Reinhard Bendix built bridges between American and European sociology , he did regard himself as a mediator . Bendix introduced to American sociologists a new perspective , the comparative-historical studies , moving beyond their local boundaries . The constellations of legitimating ideas were not mere reflections of life conditions , or social structure , but independent and real forces . In his terms   
 Americans better understand their own history through its relation to the histories of European nations . The methodological problems raised by such comparisons could inspire him to propose a philosophy of history , but it was not his goal .

 = Karl Schwarz =   
Karl Schwarz ( 19 November 1812 – 25 March 1885 ) was a German Protestant theologian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
    
 === Birth and early life ===   
 He was born at Wiek , Rügen . His father , Theodor Schwarz , pastor at Wiek , was well known as a preacher , and as the writer of a number of popular works ( parables , romances , etc . ) under the pseudonym `` Theodor Melas '' .   
    
    
 === University studies ===   
 Karl Schwarz studied theology and philosophy at Halle , and afterwards at Bonn ( 1831 ) and Berlin ( 1832–1834 ) . At Berlin he came under the influence of Schleiermacher and G. W. F. Hegel , whose influences are seen in his work Das Wesen der Religion ( 1847 ) . In 1837 he was imprisoned for six months on account of his advanced political opinions . After his release he helped ( from 1838 ) with the Hallische Jahrbücher .   
    
    
 === Later life and distinctions ===   
 From 1843 to 1845 , he lectured at Halle , and was then suspended by the government . In 1849 , however , he was appointed professor extraordinarius , and later received a number of distinctions ( in 1858 chief court preacher , etc. ) . Schwarz took an important part in the founding and directing of the German Protestantenverein and became an eminent exponent of liberal theology . His work Zur Geschichte der neuesten Theologie ( 1856 , 4th ed . 1869 ) is a valuable source for the history of theology in Germany . His other works include Lessing als Theologe ( 1854 ) and Grundriss der christ . Lehre ( 1873 , 5th ed . 1876 ) . In his memory , a Karl-Schwarz-Stiftung was founded in connection with the theological faculty at the University of Jena .

 = Ursula Fleming =   
Ursula Fleming ( 1930 in Liverpool – 1992 in London ) was an English psychotherapist , Lay Dominican and author ; she was considered an expert in her field of work.Fleming was educated at Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries in south west Scotland . She began developing pain control techniques , as she wanted to be a concert pianist and wanted to control her nerves . Her attempts to find a cure for her unsteady hands led her to find a technique , which she used to treat thousands of patients , and led to her follow a career in alternative medicine . Her technique , known as the Fleming Method , relies on relaxed concentration to overcome pain . Ursula dreamed of opening a training center where she could pass on her knowledge to others but was unable to fulfill her goal due to dying of leukemia . She was married to English tennis player Jack Darkins.In 1987 , Ursuala Fleming was one of the co-founders of The Eckhart Society , a group that aims to promote the views of medieval theologian Meister Eckhart . The society website states :   
    
 The impact of Ursula ’ s work has been enormous . There is now a veritable industry of publications about Eckhart , both books and articles in scholarly journals . Eckhart is becoming ever more widely known . Dag Hammarskjöld , the former Secretary General of the United Nations always had Eckhart ’ s works by his bedside . The Meister Eckhart Gesellschaft was established in Germany in 2004 . Each year there are many doctoral theses published on Eckhart in different languages , and the constant demand for back issues of The Eckhart Review are proof if more were needed of Ursula ’ s success in helping to rehabilitate the Meister . Ursula ’ s book Grasping the Nettle ( 1990 ) has been translated into Russian and is now being translated into Czech .   
 Fleming wrote five books and featured in another , the most notable were two on pain control called Grasping the nettle : A positive approach to pain and Fleming Method of Relaxation for Concentration , Stress Management and Pain Control . They are designed to help health care professionals teach pain control techniques to patients .

He was for many years a Professor of Applied Mathematics in the University of Cambridge , and was founding head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ( DAMTP ) . In 1956 he founded the influential Journal of Fluid Mechanics which he edited for some forty years . Prior to Cambridge he studied at Melbourne High School and University of Melbourne.As an applied mathematician ( and for some years at Cambridge a co-worker with Sir Geoffrey Taylor in the field of turbulent flow ) , he was a keen advocate of the need for physical understanding and sound experimental basis .   
 His An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics ( CUP , 1967 ) is still considered a classic of the subject , and has been re-issued in the Cambridge Mathematical Library series , following strong current demand . Unusual for an 'elementary ' textbook of that era , it presented a treatment in which the properties of a real viscous fluid were fully emphasised . He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959.The Batchelor Prize award , is named in his honour and is awarded every four years at the meeting of the International Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics .

 = Wilhelm Heinrich Kramer =   
Wilhem Heinrich Kramer ( 1724 , Dresden – 13 October 1765 ) was a German physician and naturalist.Kramer studied in Vienna ( Austria ) then practiced medicine in Bruck , close to the capital , for at least fourteen years . He published in 1756 a work entitled Elenchus Vegetabilium and Animalium per Austriam inferiorem Observatorum , a flora and fauna of Lower Austria noted especially because it was one of the first works to adopt the binomial nomenclature of Carl von Linné ( 1707–1778 ) . In this book , Kramer created the name pratincola for the collared pratincole which was adapted in English in the following work of Thomas Pennant ( 1726–1798 ) in 1773 . It is probably for him that Giovanni Antonio Scopoli ( 1723–1788 ) dedicated Psittacus krameri ( today Psittacula krameri ) in 1769 . He is also known as an entomologist .

 == Life ==   
 Mostny was born in Linz in 1914 . She enrolled at Vienna University but she had to leave in 1937 because of the rise of the Nazis . She had already completed her dissertation on the clothes of ancient Egypt and part of her exams but she had to complete her doctorate in Brussels in Belgium in 1939 . She had already taken part in archaeological investigations at both Luxor and Cairo in Egypt . She left with her brother , Kurt , and her mother for Chile . Chile took in a large number of German refugees in 1939 . There was already a significant German community in Chile , but this was also a source of anti-Semitism.At the end of the war she was invited back to Austria but she preferred to become a naturalised Chilean in 1946.She led a number of archaeological investigations in South America . In 1954 she was involved when her museum took delivery of the Plomo Mummy . This mummy was the remains of a child found on a mountain where it had been sacrificed by the Incas.Mostny took over from Humberto Fuenzalida Villegas and led the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago from 1964 to 1982.Mostny died from cancer in Santiago in 1991 .

 = Gerda Laski =   
Gerda Laski ( 4 June 1893 , Vienna – 24 November 1928 , Berlin ) was an Austrian/German physicist known for her research in infrared radiation . She went to a private girls secondary grammar school in Vienna and graduated in 1913 .   
 She earned her doctorate in physics from the University of Vienna in 1917 on `` Size Determination of Submicroscopic Particles Based on Optical and Mechanical Effects '' . From 1918 to 1919 , she worked as an assistant at the University of Göttingen and , in 1920 , as an assistant in the Physical Institute of the Technical University of Berlin , where she was introduced to the experimental technique that became her major interest.Her early research concerned the Bohr model . Laski was a student of Peter Debye , who was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1936 . Debye studied the dispersion of light by Bohr 's hydrogen model and found that the theoretical curve corresponded satisfactorily to the curve observed . Laski later showed agreement between theory and experiment , however based on an erroneous interpretation of data .   
 Laski 's main research focus later on was infrared research . This included the examination of selected chemical substances by means of infrared radiation—a field of application . Beginning in 1924 , Laski was the director of the Infrared Department at the Institute for Fibre Chemistry of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society , a department which was closed due to lack of financing . She then became a voluntary assistant at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt ( Imperial Physical-Technical Institute ) in 1927 , in order to establish an infrared laboratory .   
 After serious illness , the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics provided Laski with a monthly stipend until her death in 1928.Her final work was on special methods for infrared measurement and thermoelectricity . Her research also included studying natural infrared frequencies of diatomic Bohr gas molecules and their specific heat at high temperatures .   
    
    
 == Literature ==   
 Laski wrote her thesis on `` Size Determination of Submicroscopic Particles Based on Optical and Mechanical Effects '' , which was published in 1917 and is 48 pages long . The book is written in German and is part of the holdings of the German National Library .

 = Giambattista Nolli =   
Giambattista Nolli ( or Giovanni Battista ) [ April 9 , 1701 – July 3 , 1756 ] , was an Italian architect and surveyor . He is best known for his ichnographic plan of Rome , the Pianta Grande di Roma which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748 , and now universally known as the Nolli Map . The map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measures 176 centimetres ( 69 in ) by 208 centimetres ( 82 in ) and was published in response to the commission of Pope Benedict XIV to survey Rome in order to help create demarcations for the 14 traditional rioni or districts . It was by far the most accurate description of Rome produced to date at a time when the architectural achievement of the Papacy was in full flower .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in 1701 in Castiglione d'Intelvi ( Como ) , he moved to Rome thanks to the patronage of members of the patrician Albani and Corsini families .   
 As an architect , he worked on the churches of Sant'Alessio on the Aventine Hill ( 1743 ) and Santa Dorotea in Trastevere ( 1751–1756 ) .   
    
    
 == Nolli Map ==   
 The Nolli map reflects Bufalini 's map of 1551 , with which Nolli readily invited comparison , however Nolli made a number of important innovations . Firstly , Nolli reorients the city from east ( which was conventional at the time ) to magnetic north , reflecting Nolli 's reliance on the compass to get a bearing on the city 's topography . Secondly , though he follows Bufalini in using a figure-ground representation of built space with blocks and building shaded in a dark poché , Nolli represents enclosed public spaces such as the colonnades in St. Peter 's Square and the Pantheon as open civic spaces . Finally , the map was a significant improvement in accuracy , even noting the asymmetry of the Spanish Steps . The map was used in government planning for the city of Rome until the 1970s ; it was used as a base map for all Roman mapping and planning up to that date .   
 The map is framed with a vedute by Stefano Pozzi . A scaled-down edition , a collaboration between Nolli and Giovanni Battista Piranesi , was published in the same year the original map was finished . Piranesi was instrumental in getting the work printed ; Giuseppe Vasi also contributed .

 = Robert Bruce Merrifield =   
Robert Bruce Merrifield ( July 15 , 1921 – May 14 , 2006 ) was an American biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1984 for the invention of solid phase peptide synthesis .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 He was born in Fort Worth , Texas , on 15 July 1921 , the only son of George E. Merrifield and Lorene née Lucas . In 1923 the family moved to California where he attended nine grade schools and two high schools before graduating from Montebello High School in 1939 . It was there that he developed an interest both in chemistry and in astronomy .   
 After two years at Pasadena Junior College he transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . After graduation in chemistry he worked for a year at the Philip R. Park Research Foundation taking care of an animal colony and assisting with growth experiments on synthetic amino acid diets . One of these was the experiment by Geiger that first demonstrated that the essential amino acids must be present simultaneously for growth to occur .   
 He returned to graduate school at the UCLA chemistry department with professor of biochemistry M.S . Dunn to develop microbiological methods for the quantitation of the pyrimidines . The day after graduating on 19 June 1949 , he married Elizabeth Furlong and the next day left for New York City and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 At the Institute , later Rockefeller University , he worked as an Assistant for Dr. D.W. Woolley on a dinucleotide growth factor he discovered in graduate school and on peptide growth factors that Woolley had discovered earlier . These studies led to the need for peptide synthesis and , eventually , to the idea for solid phase peptide synthesis ( SPPS ) in 1959 . In 1963 , he was sole author of a classic paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in which he reported a method he called `` solid phase peptide synthesis '' . This article is the fifth most cited paper in the journal 's history .   
 In the mid-60s Dr. Merrifield 's laboratory first synthesized bradykinin , angiotensin , desamino-oxytocin and insulin . In 1969 , he and his colleague Bernd Gutte announced the first synthesis of the enzyme , ribonuclease A . This work proved the chemical nature of enzymes .   
 Dr. Merrifield 's method greatly stimulated progress in biochemistry , pharmacology and medicine , making possible the systematic exploration of the structural basis of the activities of enzymes , hormones and antibodies . The development and applications of the technique continued to occupy his laboratory , where he remained active at the bench until recently . In 1993 , he published his autobiography , `` Life during a Golden Age of Peptide Chemistry . '' He received the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Award for outstanding contributions to Biomolecular Technologies in 1998 .   
 The achievement of synthesizing ribonuclease A ( with Bernd Gutte ) was all the more significant in that it demonstrated that the linear sequence of amino acids joined in peptide bonds determined directly the tertiary structure of a peptide or protein . I.e . that information coded in one dimension can directly determine the three-dimensional structure of a molecule .   
 SPPS has been expanded to include solid phase synthesis of nucleotides and saccharides .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 After raising their 6 children , James , Nancy , Betsy , Cathy , Laurie and Sally , his wife Elizabeth ( Libby ) , a biologist by training , joined the Merrifield laboratory at Rockefeller University where she worked for over 23 years .   
 After a long illness R. Bruce Merrifield died on May 14 , 2006 at the age of 84 in his home in Cresskill , New Jersey . He is survived by his wife , children and 16 grandchildren .

Alexander Oscar Gettler ( August 13 , 1883 – August 4 , 1968 ) was a toxicologist with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York ( OCME ) between 1918 and 1959 , and the first forensic chemist to be employed in this capacity by a U.S. city . His work at OCME with Charles Norris , the chief medical examiner , created the foundation for modern medicolegal investigation in the U.S. and Gettler has been described by peers as `` the father of forensic toxicology in America . `` The Alexander O. Gettler Award is a prize established in his name by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 Gettler was born Jewish in Galicia , Poland , a part of the Empire of Austria-Hungary in 1883 . As Oscar Gettler , aged seven , he emigrated to the U.S. with his father , Joseph Gettler , and sister , Elise , on board the Red Star Line steamer , Westernland , which arrived at the Port of New York on May 6 , 1891 ; they settled in Brooklyn , where he was raised . He studied at the City College of New York and in 1912 received his PhD in Biochemistry from Columbia University . Prior to his employment with OCME he worked as a clinical chemist at the Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan and taught Biochemistry at the New York University School of Medicine . He married Alice Gorman in 1912 .   
    
    
 == Toxicology work ==   
 Charles Norris established the OCME in 1918 and set up his first offices in the Pathology Building ( the 'City Morgue ' ) of Bellevue Hospital . While there he asked Gettler if he would be willing to conduct any chemical testing that might be required to which Gettler agreed . An OCME laboratory , where testing was carried out for the presence of the common poisons , was set up on the third floor of the City Morgue building on First Avenue and 29th Street.Gettler often had to create new tests to isolate poisons . He regularly experimented by poisoning raw liver and attempting to isolate ever-smaller amounts of poison from it . These tests often involved mashing or liquifying tissue , followed by such tests as crystal formation , melting and boiling point analysis , color reactions , and titration . In 1935 , Gettler was the first scientist to use a spectrometer in a criminal investigation in order to prove that the thallium that had poisoned the four children of Brooklyn bookkeeper Frederick Gross did not come from cocoa powder Gross had brought home from work . A previous chemical test had mistaken copper contamination from the box for thallium leading to Gross 's arrest . The examiners eventually concluded that his wife had murdered the children before dying herself of encephalitis.Gettler often had to work for low pay , due to severe budget cuts to the toxicology office . In addition to this , Gettler also wrote numerous papers on isolating poisons such as benzene from human bodies .   
    
    
 == Teaching ==   
 In the 1920s , Gettler took the post of professor of chemistry at Washington Square College of New York University . At the same time he held a post at the New York University Graduate School . There , Gettler established a toxicology course in 1935 . He retired from teaching in 1948 , when he reached the mandatory retirement age .   
    
    
 == Later life and death ==   
 Gettler retired from the office of the medical examiner on January 1 , 1959 , when he was 75 . He remained interested in toxicology until he died due to a terminal illness approximately ten years after retiring .

 = William Nicholson (chemist) =   
William Nicholson ( 13 December 1753 – 21 May 1815 ) was a renowned English chemist and writer on `` natural philosophy '' and chemistry , as well as a translator , journalist , publisher , scientist , inventor , patent agent and civil engineer .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Nicholson was educated in Yorkshire , and after leaving school , he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the British East India Company . His first ship was reportedly called the Boston and the second voyage was on board the Gatton .   
 Subsequently , having become acquainted with Josiah Wedgwood in 1775 , he moved to Amsterdam , where he made a living for a few years as Wedgwood 's agent .   
 On his return to England he was persuaded by Thomas Holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals , while also assisting Holcroft with some of his plays and novels . Meanwhile , he devoted himself to the preparation of An Introduction to Natural Philosophy , which was published in 1781 and was at once successful . A translation of Voltaire 's Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy soon followed , and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism .   
 In 1784 he was proposed by Josiah Wedgwood ( the current Chairman ) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain , and he was also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture , established in 1791 . He gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting , file-making , cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an areometer .   
    
    
 == Scientific work ==   
 On 12 December 1783 , Nicholson was elected to the `` Chapter Coffee House Philosophical Society '' . He was proposed by Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan and seconded by horologist John Whitehurst.Nicholson communicated to the Royal Society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects . In the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over Richard Kirwan 's essay on phlogiston , and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the French academicians ( Lavoisier , Monge , Berthollet , and Guyton de Morveau ) as ‘ An Essay on Phlogiston , to which are added Notes. ’ In 1797 he founded , published , and wrote part of the Journal of Natural Philosophy , Chemistry and the Arts , generally known as Nicholson 's Journal , the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in Great Britain . The journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs , by George Cayley in 1809-1810 . The publication continued until 1814 .   
 In 1799 he established a school in London 's Soho Square , where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry , with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from Thomas Pitt .   
 In May 1800 he with Anthony Carlisle discovered electrolysis , the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current . The two were then appointed to a chemical investigation committee of the new Royal Institution . But his own interests shortly turned elsewhere.Besides considerable contributions to the Philosophical Transactions , Nicholson wrote translations of Fourcroy 's Chemistry ( 1787 ) and Chaptal 's Chemistry ( 1788 ) , First Principles of Chemistry ( 1788 ) and a Chemical Dictionary ( 1795 ) ; he also edited the British Encyclopedia , or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences ( 6 vols. , London , 1809 ) .   
    
    
 == Later life ==   
 During the later years of his life , Nicholson 's attention was chiefly directed to water supply engineering at Portsmouth , at Gosport and in Hammersmith . William Nicholson died in Bloomsbury at the age of 61 on 21 May 1815 , attended by Sir Anthony Carlisle .

 == Biography ==   
 He studied at the Universities of Bonn and Rostock . In 1863 , he received his doctorate from Rostock , where he subsequently became a lecturer of anatomy ( 1864 ) and an associate professor of comparative anatomy ( 1865 ) . In 1871 he established the zoological institute at the University of Rostock . Later on , he served as a professor at the Universities of Graz and Berlin .   
 In 1872 , he took part in the `` Pomerania '' expedition to the North Sea .   
 For several years during the 1890s , he was president of the German Zoological Society ( Deutsche Zoologische Gesellschaft ) .   
 He made contributions in his studies on the anatomy and developmental history of invertebrates , in particular , his research and publications in regards to sea-sponges . He was especially interested in a class of sponges known as Hexactinellida , of which he studied from collections taken from the U.S. `` Albatross Expedition '' and the British `` Challenger Expedition '' ( 1873–76 ) . Schulze also conducted important investigations of delicate sponge-like protozoans known as xenophyophores .   
 In 1883 , Schulze was the first to describe Trichoplax adhaerens , one of the most basal multicellular animals and member species of the phylum placozoa .

 = Charles Blagden =   
Sir Charles Brian Blagden FRS ( 17 April 1748 – 26 March 1820 ) was a British physician and scientist . He served as a medical officer in the Army ( 1776–1780 ) and later held the position of Secretary of the Royal Society ( 1784–1797 ) . Blagden won the Copley Medal in 1788 and was knighted in 1792 .   
 He died in Arcueil , France in 1820 , and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris .   
    
    
 == Science ==   
 In June 1783 , Blagden , then assistant to Henry Cavendish , visited Antoine Lavoisier in Paris and described how Cavendish had created water by burning `` inflammable air '' . Lavoisier 's dissatisfaction with the Cavendish 's `` dephlogistinization '' theory led him to the concept of a chemical reaction , which he reported to the Royal Academy of Sciences on 24 June 1783 , effectively founding modern chemistry . He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789.Blagden experimented on human ability to withstand high temperatures . In his report to the Royal Society in 1775 , he was first to recognise the role of perspiration in thermoregulation.Blagden 's experiments on how dissolved substances like salt affected the freezing point of water led to the discovery that the freezing point of a solution decreases in direct proportion to the concentration of the solution , now called Blagden 's Law .

 = Bryan Drake =   
Bryan Ernest Hare Drake ( 7 October 1925 – 25 December 2001 ) was a New Zealand-born baritone who became particularly associated with the operas of Benjamin Britten.Born in Dunedin , Drake sang in the choir of the local St Paul 's cathedral , and was educated at Otago Boys ' High School . He then studied at the University of Otago , where he sang with the music society . He made his opera debut in 1948 as Escamillo in Bizet 's Carmen , in a production originally staged as part of the Otago Centennial , which then toured around the country.Receiving a government bursary in 1949 , Drake travelled to London . The following year he received a two-year contract as a full-time principal in the Covent Garden Opera Company . During that time he created the roles of Donald , in the 1951 world premiere of Britten 's Billy Budd , and Watchful in Vaughan Williams 's The Pilgrim 's Progress . To cover a difficult scene change , Vaughan Williams inserted an aria specially for Drake , of which The Times critic commented : `` For pure singing , there was nothing finer than the interlude between the first and second acts , in which Mr Bryan Drake sang the 121st psalm with perfect declamation and limpid purity of tone and style . `` At the Welsh National Opera during the 1950s and '60s , Drake 's roles included Germont in Traviata , Ferrando in Trovatore , Flint , the sailing-master , in Billy Budd , and the title roles in Nabucco and Macbeth . At Sadler 's Wells , he sang Creon in Stravinsky 's Oedipus Rex and Mephistopheles in Gounod 's Faust .   
 In 1960 , Britten invited Drake to sing the role of Junius in The Rape of Lucretia , at the Aldeburgh festival . Britten , known to be exacting and for dropping musicians who ceased to please him , never lost his high opinion of Drake . For the next 15 years , Drake was a regular member of Britten 's English Opera Group , not only singing and recording various roles in his operas , but also performing various leading roles in operas by Malcolm Williamson , Gordon Crosse and Thea Musgrave . He also appeared in BBC television productions of Peter Grimes ( as Balstrode ) and Billy Budd ( as Flint , a role he also recorded for Decca under the composer 's baton ) .   
 In the Church Parables Britten composed between 1964 and 1968 , the composer wrote roles specially for Drake in all three : the Traveller in Curlew River , the Astrologer in The Burning Fiery Furnace and the Elder Son in The Prodigal Son.In 1972 , Drake began to teach singing , first at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama . He was director of opera at the Royal College of Music from 1981 until 1985 , after which he and his wife settled in Aldringham , Suffolk . From 1987 he worked as voice consultant at the Britten-Pears School in Aldeburgh . His final performance was in 1999 , when he played the Voice of God in a production of Britten 's Noye 's Fludde in Aldeburgh parish church .

 = Everard Home =   
Sir Everard Home , 1st Baronet , FRS ( 6 May 1756 , in Kingston upon Hull – 31 August 1832 , in London ) was a British surgeon .   
 Home was born in Kingston-upon-Hull and educated at Westminster School . He gained a scholarship to Trinity College , Cambridge , but decided instead to become a pupil of his brother-in-law , John Hunter , at St George 's Hospital . Hunter had married his sister , the poet and socialite Anne Home , in July 1771 . He assisted Hunter in many of his anatomical investigations , and in the autumn of 1776 he partly described Hunter 's collection . There is also considerable evidence that Home plagiarized Hunter 's work , sometimes directly , sometimes indirectly ; he also systematically destroyed his brother-in-law 's papers in order to hide evidence of this plagiarism .   
 Having qualified at Surgeons ' Hall in 1778 , Home was appointed assistant surgeon at the naval hospital , Plymouth . In 1787 he was appointed assistant surgeon , later surgeon , at St George 's Hospital . He became Sergeant Surgeon to the King in 1808 and Surgeon at Chelsea Hospital in 1821 . He was made a baronet ( of Well Manor in the County of Southampton ) in 1813 .   
 He was the first to describe the fossil creature ( later 'Ichthyosaur ' ) discovered near Lyme Regis by Joseph Anning and Mary Anning in 1812 . Following John Hunter , he initially suggested it had affinities with fish . Home also did some of the earliest studies on the anatomy of platypus and noted that it was not viviparous , theorizing that it was instead ovoviviparous . Home published prolifically on human and animal anatomy .   
 A species of turtle , Kinixys homeana Bell , 1827 , is named in his honor.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1787 , gave their Croonian Lecture many times between 1793 and 1829 and received their Copley Medal in 1807 . He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.His son , James Everard Home , became an eminent officer in the Royal Navy .

At Carnegie Mellon he was , among others , awarded the Alexander Henderson Award for 1968 for this contribution . If Jan Mossin had lived longer he would most likely have been a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 together with Professors William F. Sharpe and John Lintner.After he had finished his PhD he returned to NHH where he in 1968 was tenured professor . During his time at NHH , Mossin was visiting professor at the University of California , Berkeley ( 1969–1970 ) , New York University ( 1973–1974 ) , Columbia University ( 1976 ) , the University of Texas , Austin ( 1978–1979 ) and the University of Washington , Seattle ( 1983–1984 ) .

 = Gertrude Elles =   
Gertrude Lilian Elles MBE ( 8 October 1872 – 18 November 1960 ) was a British geologist , known for her work on graptolites .   
 Born in Wimbledon to parents who were Scottish , Elles was educated at Wimbledon High School and Newnham College , Cambridge , where in 1895 she received first class honours in the Natural Science tripos . She travelled to Dublin in 1905 , to take her D.Sc . The University of Cambridge was not then awarding women degrees . Between 1904-1907 an arrangement was made between the University of Cambridge , University of Oxford and Trinity College , Dublin to award female graduates of Cambridge and Oxford their degree in Ireland instead . She worked with Ethel Wood and Charles Lapworth .   
 Elles was an active member of the Sedgwick Club , the University of Cambridge 's official geological society where she played a pivotal role in the club 's running .   
 Her work on the genera of graptolites from North Wales and the Skiddaw Slates of the Lake District , England and from the Wenlock Shales of the Welsh borders eventually led to Elles ' receiving the Lyell Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1900 , but was unable to collect it since women were barred from meetings . In 1919 she became one of the first female Fellows of the Geological Society , and in the same year won its Murchison Medal .   
 She was awarded the MBE for work with the Red Cross during the First World War .   
 She was president of the British Association in 1923 . Elles was the first woman to be awarded a readership position at Cambridge in 1924 . She continued to lecture and research until her retirement in 1938 . She was made Reader Emeritus in 1938 , and continued to supervise students . Some of the students that she supervised at Cambridge included Dorothy Hill , Elizabeth `` Betty '' Ripper and Oliver Bulman .

 = Ilona Durigo =   
Ilona Durigo ( 13 May 1881 – 25 December 1943 ) was a Hungarian classical contralto and an academic voice teacher . She appeared internationally , mostly in concert , singing Lieder and oratorios . She is known for singing Lieder that Othmar Schoeck composed for her , and is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of her era .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born in Budapest on 13 May 1881 , Durigo was a pupil of Bianca Malezcky and Julius Stockhausen . She studied from 1902 at the Vienna Conservatory with Philipp Forstén , then took further studies with Etelka Gerster and Eduard Bellwidt in Berlin.Each year from 1930 to 1939 she performed the alto part in Bach 's St. Matthew Passion with the Concertgebouw Orchestra , conducted by Willem Mengelberg . This included the first recording of the work in 1939 , alongside Karl Erb as the Evangelist and Willem Ravelli as the vox Christi . She performed as a soloist in more than 40 concerts with the choir Der Gemischte Chor Zürich between 1911 and 1943 . Singing also in musical centres of Austria , Germany , Belgium and Italy , she is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of the period.In 1912 , Durigo first performed with Othmar Schoeck , and in 1913 she entered his social circle and they became friends . Durigo fell in love with Schoeck , but her feelings were not returned , and in any event she was by then married to the Hungarian pianist Osman Kasics . Her relationship with Schoeck was at times turbulent , but Durigo soon became the best-known interpreter of his work , and in later life he stated that she was the finest singer of his songs he had found .   
 Her many collaborations with Schoeck included his settings of poems by Hesse . The reviewer of her recital in Bern on 23 March 1915 , with Schoeck as the pianist , in the Berner Tagblatt praised her differentiated expression of emotions and the accord with the pianist : `` Frau Durigo sang diese und alle anderen Lieder ( mit der Zugabe waren es 19 ) ... mit tiefster Empfindung . Ihr eigenes Erleben dieser Lieder äusserte sich nicht allein in den musikalischen Vortragsdifferenzierungen ( so wunderzart , poesieverklärte Töne , wie die ihres Kopfregisters , hörte man vorher von keiner Sängerin ) , sondern auch im zu- und abnehmenden Glanz ihrer Augen , dieses wahren Seelenspiegels . Und dass ihre Interpretation durchwegs das vom Komponisten Empfundene zutreffend erfasste , bewies die vollkommene Harmonie ihres herrlichen Gesanges mit Schoecks eigenartig schönem Klavierspiel . `` Frau Durigo sang these and all other songs ( with those added there were nineteen ) ... with the deepest sensitivity . Her own experience of the songs shone through , not only in the musical differences of enunciation ( such wonderfully fine , such poetry-transfigured tones of the head−voice were never heard before from any singer ) , but also in the sparkle of her eyes , the true mirror of the soul , as it came and went . And the perfect harmony between her splendid singing and the exceptionally beautiful piano playing of Schoeck showed that her interpretation throughout captured the intentions of the composer .   
    
 Durigo was a voice teacher at the Zurich Conservatory from 1921 to 1937 , where one of her students was Maria Stader . She was a friend of Hermann Hesse , the composer and conductor Fritz Brun , and the violinist Alphonse Brun.Durigo returned to Budapest in 1937 and taught at the Liszt Conservatory . She died on 25 December 1943 .

 == Early life ==   
 Ferdinand Lukas Schubert was an Austrian teacher , organist and composer . He is notable for his compositions and for his role in publishing the complete works of his younger brother Franz Schubert . He received training in piano and violin from his father , Franz Theodor Schubert , and his older brother Ignaz , later from Michael Wood , and finally from the public teacher of the choir of St. Anna , Joseph Drechsler . As a boy , Ferdinand played violin in the Schubert family string quartet , with his brothers Franz and Ignaz on viola and violin and his father on cello . Franz Schubert composed many of his early string quartets for this ensemble .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 In 1810 , Schubert became organist at the Lichtentaler Parish and was also assistant teacher at an orphanage in Vienna . Four years later , in 1816 , he was promoted to full-time teacher at the orphanage . In that year , Schubert married one of his students , Anna . In 1818 , Franz Schubert composed the German Requiem D621 for Ferdinand , which Ferdinand would later publish and for which he would take credit as his own composition.In 1820 , Schubert became a teacher and choirmaster in Altlerchenfeld . In 1824 , he received an appointment as teacher at the Normal-Hauptschule at St. Anna . After his first wife had died , Ferdinand married his second wife , Therese , in 1832 . His two marriages produced a total of 29 children , of whom 12 survived to adulthood . In 1838 , he became an honorary professor of organ at the Conservatory . Since he was admired in professional circles for his outstanding work as a school administrator , he received the post of director of the normal primary school at St. Anna in 1851 .   
 Ferdinand kept a considerable part of the musical estate of Franz Schubert . With the exception of certain operas , masses , and symphonies , he sold the bulk of Franz Schubert 's compositions to Anton Diabelli after Franz 's death in 1828 . Diabelli 's firm published the catalog over the course of the next 30 years , even after Diabelli 's death.Ferdinand also wrote numerous educational journals and a number of sacred compositions and smaller pieces for school use . Although he worked hard all his life , his family lived in poor economic conditions . So his will called for any work published after his death to be for the support of his dependents .

Oskar Scheibel ( 1881–1953 ) was an Austrian engineer and amateur entomologist who specialized in the beetles of the Yugoslavian region and specialized in cave beetles of the family Trechinae . One of the most famous beetles that he described as new to science was the now endangered blind cave beetle that he named as Anophthalmus hitleri after Adolf Hitler .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
 Scheibel was born in Austria in 1881 and little is known of his early life but he became a railway engineer in the Austro-Hungarian region where he took an interest in cave beetles . He collected many new species and described a few himself while other entomologists named some species in his honour based on specimens that he had collected . He sold his collections of about 15000 specimens in 1921 to Germany.He is best remembered for naming in honour of Adolf Hitler - Anophthalmus hitleri in 1937 . The beetle is now endangered and known from just five caves in Slovenia.Part of his insect collection is now at the Natural History Museum Basel as part of the G.

 He discovered zoology through his father , an amateur ornithologist . He started taking medical classes at the University of Turin , with his studies eventually turning to zoology . In 1886 , he obtained his degree from the university under the direction of Michele Lessona ( 1823-1894 ) . After graduation , he remained in Turin as an assistant to Lessona , and later Lorenzo Camerano ( 1856-1917 ) , at the zoological institute . Here he worked until his retirement in 1920 .   
 At the zoological institute , he served as curator of herpetological collections . Among the specimens at the museum were reptiles and amphibians that were produced at his estate , where he kept a large temperature-controlled vivarium with tropical plants , containing animals that included giant salamanders and Galapagos tortoises .   
 Many of his written works dealt with herpetological collections from South America and Africa ( including Madagascar ) , with some publications on specimens from Italy , the Middle East , China and Australia . He was the taxonomic authority of numerous reptile and amphibian species , and has several species named after him , such as Peracca 's clawed frog ( Xenopus clivii ) , Mantidactylus peraccae , Anolis peraccae , and Lepidoblepharis peraccae , the latter three species being described by his friend , George Albert Boulenger ( 1858–1937 ) .

His most prominent work was Geheimniß des Gnadenbunds , dem großen Bundesgott zu Ehren und allen heylbegierigen Seelen zur Erbauung geöffnet , published in six volumes from 1712 . In 1726 he published Synopsis historiae sacrae . He also published a number of catechisms ; among them were Milch der Wahrheit , nach Anleitung des Heidelberge Katechismus ( 1718 ) , Einleitung zu dem Geheimnis des Gnadenbundes , and Delineatio theologae activae , considered to be the `` first system of ethics derived from federal theology '' .

 = Carl Snyder =   
Carl Snyder ( April 23 , 1869 , Cedar Falls IA – 1946 Santa Barbara CA ) was an American economist and statistician .   
 Although he attended the University of Iowa and studied in Paris , he was chiefly self-taught . He began as a journalist ; at the age of 20 , he was editor of the Council Bluffs Nonparell , later writing editorials for the Washington Post . Snyder was also something of a science writer , authoring popular articles in magazines such as McClure 's and the Fortnightly Review about , for example , Jacques Loeb 's experiments on the nature of living tissue . He was a president of the American Statistical Association , a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science and of the American Academy of Arts and Letters , and a member of the Institut Internationale de Statistique .   
 In the 1910s and 20s , Snyder was employed as a statistician in the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , under Benjamin Strong . The two men clashed , but still respected each other . During these years , he lectured at American universities and contributed to economic and statistical journals .   
 Snyder 's response to the Great Depression was to write his magnum opus Capitalism the Creator ( 1940 ) . The book , written in an eccentric prose style replete with fragmentary sentences , is part classical liberal manifesto , part elucubration of an enthusiastic statistical autodidact . It blamed the Depression on the Fed 's failure to stabilize the money stock and the price level . The book provided inspiration to such figures as Ayn Rand and Friedrich von Hayek .

 In today 's language , Scheffers ' Qss has the quaternion algebra as a subalgebra .   
 Scheffers anticipates the concepts of direct product of algebras and direct sum of algebras with his section ( p 317 ) on reducibility , addition , and multiplication of systems .   
 Thus Scheffers pioneered the structural approach to algebra .   
 Though the article covers new ground with its exploration of Nqss , it is also a literature review going back to the work of Hermann Hankel . In §14 ( p 386 ) Scheffers reviews both German and English authors on hypercomplex numbers . In particular , he cites Eduard Study ’ s work of 1889 . For volume 41 of Mathematische Annalen Scheffers contributed a further short note , this time including reference to 1867 work by Edmond Laguerre on linear systems , a rich source of hypercomplex numbers .

Paul Wilhelm Gustav Weyland ( 20 January 1888 , Berlin – 6 December 1972 , Bad Pyrmont ) was the anti-semitic leader of the Anti Einstein League.In 1919 Weyland published the novel Hie Kreuz - hie Triglaff ( The Cross against the Triglav ) , which gives a chauvinistic account of the historical events of the tenth century A.D. in Pomerania . It ends with an open allusion to the contemporary conflicts between Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia . A second book Der Tanz als kulturelles Ausdrucksmittel ( Dancing as an expression of culture ) was promised , with a chapter on modern dance as a sign of cultural decline . However this book never appeared and Weyland was to move on to scientific theory.Weyland was a key figure involved in organising an anti-semitic campaign against relativity . In August 1920 he organised a mass meeting at the Berliner Philharmonie to contest Einstein 's theory of relativity . After ensuring the meeting had been well-advertised in the newspapers , Weyland delivered a vituperative attack on Einstein , described as `` with heavy artillery '' in one newspaper . This attack consisted primarily of unsubstantial insults against the theory of relativity alongside claims that it was promoted by a `` the clique of [ Einstein 's ] academic supporters '' . Weyland claimed that the theory constituted a form of hypnotic mass suggestion and Jewish arrogance , which was a product of an unsettling spiritually chaotic period and that it amongst other repellent ideas it was poisoning of German thought . It was this speech which culminated in the statement : `` Relativity theory is scientific Dadaism '' .He was later granted American citizenship .

 = Alfred Potier =   
Alfred Potier ( 11 May 1840 , in Paris – 8 May 1905 , in Paris ) was a French polymath who contributed to many theoretical and practical fields of science when this was rapidly expanding . His interests covered mainly mathematical physics , the nature of light and the ether , geology , electricity and magnetism and their practical applications in industry . His name ’ s claim to fame rests , however , on a little explored footnote inserted by Michelson and Morley in their famous paper “ On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether ” .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in 1840 , Potier entered the École Polytechnique at age 17 , where in 1867 he became a physics teacher , and then in 1881 full Professor of Physics , succeeding Jamin and preceding Nobel Laureate Henri Becquerel . At the same time , he was member of the State Mining Engineers Corps , occupying the chair of Physics in the École des Mines where he taught Henri Poincaré . Geological works included revisions of the geological map of France and submarine topographies in Pas-de-Calais in order to examine the feasibility of a tunnel to England . These , and his valor during the German siege of Paris in 1870 , earned him the Légion d'honneur . His other publications concerned Fresnel ’ s theories of light and the ether , diffraction of polarized light , elliptical reflection , magnetic rotational forces , or interference fringes . He contributed extensive notes to JC Maxwell ’ s treatise on electromagnetism , facilitating its reading in France .   
 Potier was a member of many committees at the famous 1881 Universal Exposition in Paris , including the one that set the standards for units in electricity . The French Physics Society appointed Potier as president in 1884 ; the International Electricians Society did the same in 1895 . In 1891 he was accepted into the French Academy of Science .   
    
    
 == Speed of light ==   
 Following Thomas Young ’ s ideas , light was regarded in the 19th century to move as vibrations ( undulations ) in a substance called the Luminiferous aether , contrary to Newton ’ s ideas that light itself was made of substantive corpuscles . Exploring the nature of this aether , Albert Michelson published in 1881 his laboratory experiments where he had light travel in the direction of the earth ’ s motion and perpendicular to it . Thus measured on the moving earth , he found no difference in the speed of light traveling with the earth or perpendicular to it . It would have fully conformed to rules prevailing in a Galilean invariance system of coordinates , also called Newtonian inertial system , which apply to moving material particles .   
 In the 1887 paper , written with Edward Morley , Michelson amended the route of the perpendicular light from ab1 to ab : “ It may be mentioned here that the error was pointed out to the author of the former paper by M.A . Potier , of Paris , in the winter of 1881. ” When the instrument on the moving earth is observed from a stationary point outside earth , the mirror at b1 already moved to b while light was traveling there from a . “ This meant that Michelson had overestimated by a factor of two the fringe shifts originally expected. ” The mirror at c also moved forward at the same time , but this was not taken into account . It thus seemed that light traveled different distances at the same time , which led George FitzGerald and Hendrik Lorentz ( Lorentz ether theory ) to postulate that distances shortened and time dilated in direction of motion ( FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction ) .

( He was of Greek origin ; his grandfather had gone sailing from Cephalonia as a young man , been shipwrecked , and washed up near Odessa , where he remained for the rest of his life . ) He specialized in the field of child neuropsychology .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 In 1884 he graduated from the University of Moscow , and subsequently worked under Aleksei Kozhevnikov ( 1836-1902 ) at the clinic of neurological diseases . He earned his medical doctorate in 1887 , and in 1890 became head of the department of neurology at the clinic of Aleksei Alekseevich Ostroumov ( 1844-1908 ) .   
 In 1911 , along with other academic personnel at the University of Moscow , he resigned in protest against reactionary reforms installed by the minister of education . Afterwards , he opened his own institute of neurology and child psychology . In 1917 he returned to the university , and attained the chair of neuropathology . In this position , he established a department for child psycho-neurology and `` defectology '' .   
 Rossolimo is remembered for his work in experimental psychology , research that included the development of psychological profiles . A particular study of his involved grouping children according to psycho-physiological characteristics and anomalies .

 = Adriaan van Wijngaarden =   
Adriaan `` Aad '' van Wijngaarden ( 2 November 1916 – 7 February 1987 ) was a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist , who is considered by many to have been the founding father of informatica ( computer science ) in the Netherlands .   
 Even though he was trained as an engineer , Van Wijngaarden would emphasize and promote the mathematical aspects of computing , first in numerical analysis , then in programming languages and finally in design principles of programming languages .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 His education was in mechanical engineering , for which he received a degree from Delft University of Technology in 1939 . He then studied for a doctorate in hydrodynamics , but abandoned the area . He joined the Nationaal Luchtvaartlaboratorium in 1945 and went with a group to England the following year to learn about new technologies that had been developed there during World War II .   
 Van Wijngaarden was intrigued by the new idea of automatic computing , and on 1 January 1947 he became the head of the Computing Department of the brand-new Mathematisch Centrum ( MC ) in Amsterdam . He then made further visits to England and the United States , gathering ideas for the construction of the first Dutch computer , the ARRA , an electromechanical construction first demonstrated in 1952 . In that same year , Van Wijngaarden hired Edsger Dijkstra , and they worked on software for the ARRA .   
 While visiting Edinburgh in 1958 , Van Wijngaarden was seriously injured in an automobile accident in which his wife was killed . After he recovered , he focused more on programming language research , and was one of the designers of the original ALGOL , and later ALGOL 68 , for which he developed a two-level type of grammar that became known as Van Wijngaarden grammars . He became the director of the MC in 1961 , and remained in that post for the next twenty years .   
 In 1959 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences .

 = Alfred Byrd Graf =   
Alfred Byrd Graf ( November 23 , 1901 – December 14 , 2001 ) was a German-American botanist who traveled the world in search of obscure plant species , discovering more than 100 previously undocumented varieties . He photographed and documented his findings in a number of richly illustrated ( and correspondingly expensive ) books he wrote on the subject .   
 Graf was born in Nuremberg on November 23 , 1901 and studied at botanic gardens in Vienna and took courses in botany , photography and language throughout Europe , in California and at Fairleigh Dickinson University.He came to work on a ranch in Nebraska in the 1920s and later established a floral shop in Sioux City , Iowa that failed after his greenhouse was demolished as the result of a hailstorm . He found a position in 1931 with the Julius Roehrs Company , a tropical nursery in New Jersey , where his experience growing orchids in his youth in Germany helped him tap into what was becoming a major field of interest in the U.S. With his position at Roehrs , his travels allowed him to bring back new species that the company could add to its catalog , which morphed into book form as the Exotic Plant Manual , complete with 7,000 photos.Graf 's writings were based on firsthand research done on travels around the world , having visited sites of plants that could be found on Mount Kilimanjaro , in New Guinea and throughout China , India and much of Asia , uncovering scores of previously undocumented species which he introduced to Western plant aficionados and carefully documented with his camera . Among his findings were the first known white African Violet.His books typically included thousands of his photographs and were priced accordingly . Roehrs Publishing released Exotica : Pictorial Cyclopedia of Indoor Plants in 1958 with in excess of 4,000 images , a guide to imported plants and the steps needed to grow them , his first book to receive widespread attention . The book was re-released in two volumes , with 16,000 illustrations decorating its 2,600 pages . Tropica covered plants from the areas in and around the tropics and included 7,000 images . First published in 1992 , Hortica : Color Cyclopedia of Garden Flora and Exotic Plants Indoors covers thousands of ornamental plants.He maintained a library of his photographs and travels at his home in East Rutherford , New Jersey . Graf died at the age of 100 on December 14 , 2001 , at his home in Düsseldorf , Germany , having returned there after living the majority of his life in the United States . He was survived by his wife Lieselotte Vorwerk , as well as by a daughter Doris .

 = Honor C3 A9 Langl C3 A9 =   
Honoré François Marie Langlé ( 1741–1807 ) was a French theorist of music of Monegasque origin , composer , and author of a Traité d'harmonie et de modulation ( Paris : Boyer , 1795 ) . Napoleon named him to the newly founded Paris Conservatoire.Born to a family originally from Picardy that was established at Monaco in the 18th century , Langlé showed so much early promise in music that Honoré III of Monaco sent him with an endowment to Naples at the age of fifteen . There he studied harmony and counterpoint at the Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini under the direction of Pasquale Cafaro . He remained for more than eight years , composing Masses and motets that gained him a sufficient reputation in Italy that he was appointed to direct the city theatre of Genoa .   
 In 1768 , Langlé left for France . In Paris he supported himself by giving harpsichord and singing lessons and taught musical composition to private pupils , while he gained a reputation through participating in Anne Danican Philidor 's Concerts spirituels , the most prominent venue for secular concert music in Paris . There several of his compositions premiered successfully , including a sung monologue , Alcide and a cantata Circé .   
 In the following decade his reputation spread from the Parisian musical world of Versailles , where as Langlois , the spelling preferred by his son and grandson , he gave clavecin and fortepiano lessons to Queen Marie Antoinette . When the baron de Breteuil formed the École Royale de Chant et de Déclamations in 1784 , Langlé was entrusted with teaching singing , a position he retained until the institutional changes that came with the French Revolution . With the creation of the Paris Conservatoire in 1795 , Langlé was instituted as librarian , a place he held until 1802 .   
 His theoretical Traité d'harmonie et de modulation was published at Paris in 1795 .   
 His success in the field of opera was less than secure . In 1786 his opera   
 Antiochus et Stratonice failed to please at Versailles . Five years later , during the Revolution , his three-act opera Corisandre , presented at the Académie de musique , sank without a trace . Undeterred , though unable to get them publicly mounted , Langlé continued to compose operas in private for the rest of hid life . His songs achieved more success : his `` Hymne à Bara et à Viala '' ( 1794 ) continued to be taught in music schools through the 19th century .   
 In retirement towards the end of his life at his property , Villiers le Bel , Langlé devoted himself passionately to gardening . His posthumous reputation has supported François-Joseph Fétis , who found his music lacked qualities of genius , but his Traité d ’ harmonie et de modulation long remained a staple in academic teaching .

 = Gustaf Bj C3 B6rnram =   
Gustaf Björnram ( 1746-1804 ) was a Swedish mystic and spiritualist medium.He was born in Savolax as the son of the lieutenant Per Björnram ( 1700–1766 ) and Anna Margareta Amnorin . He was a student of the Åbo University and moved to Stockholm where he became a private teacher and a secretary . Through his work as a writer for the Freemasons he came in to contact with Elis Schröderheim , who introduced him to King Gustav III of Sweden .   
 Gustaf Björnram claimed to be able to communicate with the spirits of the dead and arranged well-attended séances frequented by the king and Prince Charles , during which he allegedly forwarded predictions about the future from the dead . For a couple of years around 1780 , he was an immensely fashionable medium in Stockholm , was inducted into the Freemasons and given a Sinecure by the monarch . He once performed a séance in the church of Lovö , where he called upon the spirit of Adolf Frederick , King of Sweden in the presence of the king and a circle of his favorites , among them Adolf Fredrik Munck , where the father of the king appeared as a mask behind a curtain of smoke in the dark church .   
 However , when his prediction about the death of the king 's mother , which was eagerly awaited by the king , did not materialize , and the royal physician Sven Anders Hedin exposed him as a fraud by describing how he had witnessed his preparations for the so-called seance in the Lovö church , he lost his favor with the king , who gave him a pension and dismissed him from court . He was replaced by Henrik Gustaf Ulfvenklou .

Hendrik Samuel Houthakker ( December 31 , 1924 – April 15 , 2008 ) was a prominent American economist .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Houthakker was born in Amsterdam . His father was a prominent art dealer . As a teenager he lived through the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and , according to an interview he gave to the Valley News , was once arrested by the Gestapo but escaped and was sheltered for some months by a Roman Catholic family . He completed his graduate work at the University of Amsterdam in 1949 . He taught at Stanford University from 1954 to 1960 and then completed the rest of his career at Harvard University . In 1961 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association . Houthakker served on President Nixon 's Council of Economic Advisers from 1969 to 1971 , where he advocated replacing the International Monetary Fund 's pegged exchange rate system with a flexible peg .   
 Houthakker 's contributions to economic theory have been summarized by Pollak ( 1990 ) . He is particularly well known for the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference , to which his name is often attached . This paper reconciles Paul Samuelson 's revealed preference approach to demand theory with the earlier ordinal utility approach of Eugene Slutsky and Sir John Hicks , by showing that demand functions satisfy his Strong Axiom if and only if they can be generated by maximising a set of preferences that are `` well-behaved '' in the sense that they satisfy the axioms of choice theory , that is , they are reflexive , transitive , complete , monotonic , convex and continuous—essentially the conditions required for a Hicksian approach to demand theory .   
 Houthakker 's wife , Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka , was a Polish-born philosopher and founder of the World Phenomenology Institute ; they were married for 52 years , up to his death . Through her he became friendly with Karol Wojtyła , subsequently Pope John Paul II .   
 Barack Obama Sr. ( Barack Obama 's father ) worked as a research assistant for Houthakker over the summer in 1963 at Harvard .

 = Keith Millis =   
Keith Dwight Millis ( May 20 , 1915 – July 6 , 1992 ) was an American metallurgical engineer and inventor of ductile iron.Keith Millis grew up in Rensselaer , New York and earned his Bachelor of Science in Metallurgical Engineering as a 1938 graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . A year later he was conferred a Master of Science degree in Metallurgical Engineering at RPI .   
 Early in the Second World War , chromium was considered critical to the war effort and experimentation was conducted by Millis to find a substitute . He made his discovery while experimenting with molten iron and magnesium . The original intent was to find another element that would cause all the carbon in the cast iron alloy to be combined as carbide . Magnesium was a known carbide former . Instead , the graphite in the iron formed into spheroidal shapes , and the cast iron had high tensile strength plus it exhibited ductility . Thus was born ductile iron in 1943 .   
 Millis and others at the International Nickel Company ( Inco ) sought and obtained U.S. patent 2,485,760 on October 25 , 1949 for magnesium additions to cast iron that would spheroidize the graphite and dramatically ductilize the material.As an employee of Inco , Millis worked to promote the use of ductile iron as it began to be used as a commercial material . He also helped to found the Ductile Iron Society , an organization whose purpose is to promote the production and application of ductile iron castings .

 = Olga Preobrajenska =   
Olga Iosifovna Preobrajenska born Preobrazhenskaya ( Russian : О́льга Ио́сифовна Преображе́нская ; 2 February [ O.S . 21 January ] 1871 – 27 December 1962 ) was a Russian ballerina of the Russian Imperial Ballet and a ballet instructor .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 She was born in Saint Petersburg as Olga Preobrazhenskaya ( the final syllable of her surname was dropped to shorten her name for professional purposes , and she used the French transliteration , Preobrajenska ) .   
 Olga—born frail and with a crooked spine—was an unlikely prima ballerina . But she had dreams of being a dancer , and for years her parents tried unsuccessfully to get her enrolled in dance school . The selection committee repeatedly rejected her as a candidate . But after three years of trying , her parents succeeded and the eight-year-old Olga entered the Imperial Ballet School in 1879.Despite her physical shortcomings , Preobrazhenskaya grew strong with training under Marius Petipa , Lev Ivanov and Anna Johansson . She developed excellent turnout and toe point , though her hunched back remained troublesome . She was naturally expressive , bringing new life to a `` hackneyed '' repertoire , and exhibited the desired softness and grace of a dancer.In addition to her love of dance , Preobrazhenskaya had musicality to go with it ; she studied singing , performed opera arias , and played the piano masterfully.In 1892 , she made her debut in Kalkabrino , the first of her many performances in Petipa creations , which included Bluebeard ( 1896 ) , Les Millions d'Arlequin ( 1900 ) and Les Saisons ( 1900 ) . She also performed in Ivanov and Gerdt 's Sylvia ( 1901 ) , Nikolai and Sergei Legat 's The Fairy Doll ( 1903 ) , and Mikhail Fokin 's The Night of Terpsichore and Chopiniana ( 1908 ) .In 1895 , she began to make international appearances , including in Paris , London and the United States . In 1900 , she achieved the title of prima ballerina . One of her finest moments as a performer was dancing at Milan 's La Scala theatre . She received critical acclaim and audience adoration , no small feat for a Russian ballerina trained in the Italian school.She then began to pay more attention to ballet instruction ; in 1914 , she began her teaching career in Saint Petersburg , where her pupils included Alexandra Danilova . In 1921 , following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union , she emigrated and taught for two years in Milan , London , Buenos Aires and Berlin , before finally settling in with the large white émigré community in Paris.For the next several decades , she was one of the most prominent ballet teachers in Paris , instructing Irina Baronova , Tatiana Dokoudovska , Tamara Toumanova and Igor Youskevitch . She finally retired in 1960 ; she died two years later , aged 91 . She was buried in the Russian Orthodox section of the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery .

 = Pierre Bus C3 A9e =   
Pierre Busée ( Petrus Busaeus , Buys ) ( born at Nijmegen in 1540 ; died at Vienna in 1587 ) was a Dutch Jesuit theologian . He assisted in producing the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum and the catechism of Peter Canisius .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 When twenty-two years old he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Cologne where six years later ( 1567 ) he became master of novices . In addition to this office he was appointed to give religious instruction to the upper classes in the Jesuit college at Cologne .   
 In 1671 Busée left Cologne and went to Vienna , where he lectured on Scripture in the university and taught Hebrew at the Jesuit college . In 1584 Busée went to Rome at the directive of the General of the Society , Claudio Acquaviva , who had appointed him a member of a commission to draw up a system or plan of studies ( Ratio Studiorum ) for the entire Society . On his return to Vienna , Busée was made Rector of the College of Nobles and died while holding this position .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 He undertook to complete the large catechism of Peter Canisius by adding to it the full text of the scriptural and patristic references cited by the author . Peter Canisius himself encouraged this undertaking . The first volume appeared at Cologne in 1569 , under the title Authoritates sacræ Scripturæ et sanctorum Patrum , quæ in summa doctrinæ christianæ doctoris Petri Canisii citantur .   
 The following year , 1570 , the work was completed , and was received at once with much favor . It consists of four volumes ; for some unknown reason the last volume is lacking in the edition of the catechism , with notes by Busée , which was issued in 1571 by the house of Manutius of Venice , the descendants of Aldus Manutius . In 1577 , a new edition , revised and augmented by another Jesuit , Jean Hase , was published at Cologne in one folio volume , under another title : Opus catechisticum ... D. Petri Canisii theologi S.J . præclaris divinæ Scripturæ testimoniis , sanctorumque Patrum sententiis sedulo illustratum operâ D. Petri Busæi Noviomagni , ejusd .

 = Benjamin Gompertz =   
Benjamin Gompertz ( 5 March 1779 – 14 July 1865 ) was a British self-educated mathematician and actuary , who became a Fellow of the Royal Society . Gompertz is now best known for his Gompertz law of mortality , a demographic model published in 1825 .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Of the German Jewish family of Gompertz of Emmerich , he was born in London , where his father and grandfather had been successful diamond merchants . Debarred , as a Jew , from a university education , he studied on his own from an early age , in the writings of Isaac Newton , Colin Maclaurin , and William Emerson . From 1798 he was a prominent contributor to the Gentleman 's Mathematical Companion , and for a period won the annual prizes in the magazine for the solutions of problems.In line with his father 's wishes , he entered the London Stock Exchange . He became a member of the Mathematical Society of Spitalfields , and served as its president when it was merged with the Astronomical Society of London . In 1819 he was elected a F.R.S. , and in 1832 became a member of the council . The Astronomical Society was founded in 1820 , and he was elected a member of the council in 1821.On the death of his only son he retired from the Stock Exchange , and absorbed himself in mathematics . When the Guardian Insurance Office was established in 1821 , he was a candidate for the actuaryship , but the directors objected to him on the grounds that he was a Jew . His brother-in-law Sir Moses Montefiore with his relative Nathan Mayer Rothschild then founded the Alliance Assurance Company ( 1824 ) , and Gompertz was appointed actuary under the deed of settlement . His management of the Alliance Company was successful , he was consulted by government , and made computations for the Army medical board.In 1848 he retired from active work and returned to his scientific labours . He was a member of many learned societies , and was also one of the promoters of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge . Of the leading Jewish charities he was a prominent member , and he worked out a plan of poor relief ( Jewish Chronicle , 6 October 1845 ) , which was afterwards adopted by the Jewish board of guardians.Gompertz died from a paralytic seizure on 14 July 1865 .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
    
 MathematicsFrom 1806 he was a frequent contributor to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ; but his early tracts on complex numbers and porisms ( 1817–18 ) were self-published . Gompertz was an old-fashioned Newtonian who retained and defended the notation of fluxions .   
 AstronomyFor ten years he actively participated in the work of the Astronomical Society , contributing papers on the theory of astronomical instruments , the aberration of light , the differential sextant , and the convertible pendulum . With Francis Baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars ; the work was left uncompleted , because of the publication of the Fundamenta Astronomiæ of Friedrich Bessel . Their efforts , however , led to the complete catalogue of stars of the Royal Astronomical Society .   
 The Gompertz modelHe worked out a new series of tables of mortality for the Royal Society , and these suggested to him in 1825 his law of human mortality , which he first expounded in a letter to Francis Baily . The law rests on an a priori assumption that a person 's resistance to death decreases as his years increase . The model can be written in this way :

 = R. A. Stewart Macalister =   
Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister ( 8 July 1870 – 26 April 1950 ) was an Irish archaeologist .   
    
    
 == Biographical notes ==   
 Macalister was born in Dublin , Ireland , the son of Alexander Macalister , then professor of Professor of Zoology , University of Dublin . His father was appointed professor of anatomy at Cambridge in 1883 , and he was educated at The Perse School , and then studied at Cambridge University .   
 Although his earliest interest was in the archaeology of Ireland , he soon developed a strong interest in biblical archaeology . Along with Frederick J. Bliss , he excavated several towns in the Shephelah region of Ottoman Palestine from 1898 to 1900 . Using advances in stratigraphy building on the work of Flinders Petrie , they developed a chronology for the region using ceramic typology . Upon Bliss ' retirement , Macalister became director of excavations for the Palestine Exploration Fund ( PEF ) in 1901 .   
    
 From 1902 to 1909 he was responsible for the excavations at Gezer , in the modern state of Israel , just west of Jerusalem . This was one of the earliest large-scale scientific archaeological excavations in the region . The Gezer calendar found there is a very early paleo-Hebrew calendrical inscription . However , in most respects Macalister 's work in Biblical archaeology is considered to have been a failure , due to the poor quality of his excavation techniques and his shoddy record-keeping . Because Macalister was the only professional archaeologist involved in the excavation , managing a project of such complexity was essentially an impossible task .   
 Macalister left the field of Biblical archaeology in 1909 to accept a position as professor of Celtic archaeology at University College , Dublin , where he taught until his retirement in 1943 . During this period , he worked at the ancient Irish royal site at the Hill of Tara and was responsible for editing the catalogue of all known ogham inscriptions from Great Britain and Ireland . Many of his translations of Irish myths and legends are still widely used today . He was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1910 and served as their president from 1926 to 1931 . He was also president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland from 1924 to 1928 .   
 He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge , with his wife Margaret A. M. Macalister .

 == Early life and education ==   
 Moertel was born in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , on October 17 , 1927 . He grew up in Maywood , Illinois , and graduated from Proviso East High School . He later graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a medical degree in 1953 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Moertel joined the Mayo Clinic in 1954 , after an internship at the Los Angeles County Hospital . He founded the North Central Cancer Treatment Group in 1977 . Moertel was actively involved with the Food and Drug Administration 's Oncology Drug Advisory Committee during `` the late 1970s and early 1980s , '' and was `` a good friend '' of the National Cancer Institute 's Director at the time , Vincent T. DeVita Jr. , although the two of them commonly had professional disagreements .   
    
    
 == Research ==   
 Moertel was known for research into the effectiveness of cancer treatments . In one study , Moertel and his team reduced colon cancer recurrence by 41 % by treating patients with a combination of levamisole and fluorouracil . He presented these results in a 1989 talk he gave to the National Cancer Institute . He is also known for conducting clinical trials of laetrile and vitamin C for the treatment of cancer , and his trials of these treatments found that both of them were ineffective . In 1993 , he published a study which found that a commonly used blood test used to detect colon cancer was ineffective at improving cure rates .

 = Ludwig Rabus =   
Ludwig Rabus ( also Rab or Günzer ) ( 10 October 1523 – 22 July 1592 ) was a German Lutheran theologian and Protestant reformer .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born in Memmingen , in poor circumstances . He went to Strasbourg , where he was supported by the preacher Matthäus Zell and his wife Katharina . In 1538 Rabus became a student at University of Tübingen , and graduated M.A . in 1543 .   
 In the following years Rabus became Zell 's assistant , made a reputation as a preachers , and in 1548 was Zell 's successor . The Augsburg Interim meant he lost his post , but he remained in Strasbourg . In 1552 he became head of the Collegium Wilhelmitanum and teacher at the High School ; in 1553 together with Jacob Andreae he was awarded a Tübingen doctorate .   
 When the Strasbourg council favoured Johannes Marbach , Rabus left the city , where he was regarded as something of a fanatic , and went as minister and dean to Ulm , where he worked for 34 years . In the controversy around Kaspar Schwenckfeld he wrote against Katharina Zell , who defended herself ; what had been a long-running private disagreement about her husband 's legacy became a public quarrel.In Ulm Rabus standardised teaching , held inspections , introduced liturgical books , and supported Andreae in his efforts towards the Swabian Concord . He died there .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Rabus began to work on a selective Protestant martyrology in the late 1540s , as the Interim began to affect churches in his region . A Latin version appeared in 1552 .   
    
 The German Historien der Heyligen appeared in six volumes ( completed 1557 ) , published at Strasbourg by Samuel Emmel . It is framed as a universal history . The first volume begins with Abel and discusses biblical stories and martyrs of the Early Christian Church ; it uses Eusebius of Caesarea as a source . In the following five books around 70 martyrologies are given . He dedicated his book of martyrology to the Strasbourg council ; as well as to Christoph , Duke of Württemberg .

 Born in Vladikavkaz , Chuhaldin was the son of a Tsarist and White Army officer , Gregory Ivanovitch Chuhaldin , stationed there in a Cossack regiment , and of Maria Ivanovna Chuhaldina ( née Rasskazova ) . He was a child prodigy and began studying the violin with Julius Conus at the Moscow Conservatory at just eight years of age .   
 Chuhaldin gave his first public recital at the age of nine and quickly became active on the concert stage . In 1909 he played in the third stand of first violinists in the Bolshoi Theatre , at the first performance of Le Coq d'Or . In 1913 he joined the orchestra of the Imperial Grand Opera at the Bolshoi Theatre . He eventually served as the ensemble 's concertmaster from 1922 to 1924 . He joined the faculty of the Moscow Conservatory in 1923 where he remained for two years .   
 Chuhaldin escaped via Harbin , China , in 1924 with only his violin and the clothes on his back . He gave an extensive recital tour 1925-7 , appearing in concerts throughout Asia , Australia , and New Zealand . He met his wife Annette Chuhaldin ( née Hillhouse ) in Perth and she became his piano accompanist.In 1927 the Chuhaldins moved to Canada and he began teaching privately and performing in the city of Toronto . He eventually was invited to join the faculty of the Toronto Conservatory of Music , where he taught such notable musicians as Murray Adaskin , Harry Bergart , Isidor Desser , Betty-Ann Fischer-Byfield , Hyman Goodman , Blain Mathé , Albert Pratz , and Ivan Romanoff . In 1928 Charles Comfort painted a portrait of Chuhaldin with his Amati violin ( now in the Art Gallery of Hamilton ) .He became active as a conductor of radio orchestras , working first with the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission during the early 1930s . He then worked extensively for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on radio programs like Symphonic Strings , CBC Strings , and Melodic Strings . For the latter program he conducted the world premiere of Benjamin Britten 's Young Apollo on 27 August 1939 . The performance notably featured Britten at the piano and the composer dedicated the work to Chuhaldin.Chuhaldin was also active as a guest conductor with several Canadian orchestras , including the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1941 . He also was a guest conductor with the WPA Civic Symphony in New York City in 1936 and was appointed conductor of the Forest Hill Community Orchestra of Toronto in 1948 . Having never retired , he died in Victoria , British Columbia in 1951 at the age of 58 . He was survived by his daughter Inna ( married name MacDougall ) .

 = John Bertrand Johnson =   
John Bertrand `` Bert '' Johnson ( October 2 , 1887 – November 27 , 1970 ) ( né Johan Erik Bertrand ) was a Swedish-born American electrical engineer and physicist . He first explained in detail a fundamental source of random interference with information traveling on wires .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 According to Steve Johnson , described at http : //www.jamminpower.com/main/noise.html :   
 `` John Bertrand Johnson was a cousin of my father , Dr. John A. Johnson . Bert was born to my grandfather 's sister , who never married , in Sweden . Bert had no schooling in Sweden and lived in extreme poverty . My grandfather sent for him as a teenager and he ended up on their farm in far Northwestern North Dakota [ USA ] . My grandfather sent Bert to school and he finally graduated from high school and went on get his PhD in Physics from Princeton . I was told that he worked with Einstein when he was at Princeton and went on to be director of Bell Labs ... I met Bert several times , but I was fairly young and most of the family history is lost..I am in the process of trying to piece together more details '' .   
 According to the IEEE biography entry in , Johnson was born in the Carl Johan parish of Goteborg , Sweden and christened on October 7 , 1887 . His birth certificate only recorded his mother 's name ( Augusta Mathilda Johansdotter 9b . 1866 ) and his surname is thus derived from his assumed father Carl Bertrand Johnson . He emigrated to the US in 1904 and attended Yale . Johnson became a US citizen in 1928 . In 1919 he married Clara Louisa Conger ( d.1961 ) and in 1961 he married Ruth Marie Severtson Bowden . He had two sons by his first marriage , Bertrand Conger and Alan William . John Bertrand Johnson died aged 83 in Orange , NJ , USA , on November 27 , 1970 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 In 1928 , while at Bell Telephone Laboratories he published the journal paper `` Thermal Agitation of Electricity in Conductors '' . In electronic systems , thermal noise ( now also called Johnson noise ) is the noise generated by thermal agitation of electrons in a conductor . Johnson 's papers showed a statistical fluctuation of electric charge occur in all electrical conductors , producing random variation of potential between the conductor ends ( such as in vacuum tube amplifiers and thermocouples ) . Thermal noise power , per hertz , is equal throughout the frequency spectrum . Johnson deduced that thermal noise is intrinsic to all resistors and is not a sign of poor design or manufacture , although resistors may also have excess noise .   
    
    
 == Field-effect transistor ==   
 Johnson was possibly among the first people to make a working field effect transistor , based on Julius Edgar Lilienfeld 's US Patent 1,900,018 of 1928 . In sworn testimony to the U.S. patent office in 1949 , Johnson reported `` ... although the modulation index of 11 per cent is not great , ... the useful output power is substantial ... it is in principle operative as an amplifier '' . On the other hand , in an article in 1964 he denied the operability of Lilienfeld 's patent , saying `` I tried conscientiously to reproduce Lilienfeld ’ s structure according to his specification and could observe no amplification or even modulation .

Pavel Grošelj ( 9 February 1883 – 26 January 1940 ) was a Slovene biologist and literary historian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Pavel Grošelj was born in Ljubljana , then a town of Carniola ( Austria-Hungary ) . He showed a great interest in the natural sciences and a gift for poetry from an early age . He graduated in biology from the University of Vienna in 1906 ; the following year he also completed his doctorate there . From 1908 , he was a teacher in Ljubljana at two boys ' grammar schools and at the girls ' lycée . In 1909 , he was entrusted with the task of lecturing on mineralogy in technical courses . In 1910 he was named honorary lector , and in 1923 honorary docent for general biology at the medical faculty of the University of Ljubljana . He ran and headed the institute for biology until his death . He was elected to the position of extraordinary professor in 1931 , but he did not accept the position . He died in 1940 in Zagreb .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Grošelj was an editor of early scientific writings for the Ljubljanski zvon journal ( 1904–1905 , 1910 ) ; his first texts were published in this journal between 1902 and 1904 . He wrote the comparative literary study Prešeren in Petrarka in 1902 and his lecture France Prešeren from 1905 places him amongst the early academic authorities on Prešeren 's life and works . Grošelj campaigned in favour of the establishment of a Slovene university ( even as a freshman in lectures in Vienna ) . As a member of the commission tasked with this goal , he was later directly involved in the associated planning .   
 Grošelj worked for a number of reviews in his life . In 1933 , the natural sciences section of the Muzejsko društvo za Slovenijo ( Museum Society for Slovenia ) began on his initiative to publish a paper entitled Proteus , for which Grošelj was chosen as the editor . He was also the editor of the academic bulletin Prirodoslovne razprave from 1931 to 1939 . Some of his scientific writings were published in the book Vesolje-Zemlja-Človek ( Space-Earth-Man ) in 1957 . He also wrote articles for non-academics and took part in debates on astronomy . At the time of his death , Grošelj had almost finished a work on the nervous system of jellyfish . He also left a theoretical study on the promorphology of organisms , and his lifework Splošna biologija ( General biology ) unfinished .   
    
    
 == Recognitions ==   
 Grošelj was depicted in ca . 1904 by the sculptor Svitoslav Peruzzi . He depicted him with a primate skull in his arms . The portrait was done in the Vienna Secession style.The Prirodoslovno društvo Slovenije ( Naturalists ’ Society of Slovenia ) has awarded the Grošelj plaque in his honour since 1984 .

 == Author ==   
 Chandler was an author and historian who lectured on history , economics , and religion , especially about Moses . Chandler 's most successful book in terms of recognition by scholars is Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth ( 1987 ) . The book includes estimates of the population of cities since ancient times . Although the book has been widely quoted , urban historians have criticized Chandler 's superficial and uncritical use of sources , leading to unreliable population estimates for many past cities .   
    
    
 == Claims ==   
 Outside of his mainstream work on populations of ancient cities , Chandler held many alternative ideas on history which he discussed in his book Godly Kings and Early Ethics where he presented his ideas on Moses and his belief that Zeus and other figures in Greek mythology were actual people . He developed these claims in some of his other books as well , some of his claims included :   
    
 That Zeus was a king in Moses ' time .   
 That Tubal of ancient Spain may have built Stonehenge .   
 That Moses was Ikhnaton 's vizier Ramose .   
 That Chinese writing was derived from that of Moses .   
 That Hindu reincarnation concepts came from Egypt .   
 That Noah was the same person as the ancient Greek Aeneas .

Polyakov , however , at the time of his PhD courses ( `` aspirantship '' ) Vadim was already a first-class physicist , and supervising him was a pure formality . In 1986 he became a member of the Landau Institute . His distinguished abilities showed quite early . At the secondary school he won twice the USSR national physics olympiad . He wrote his first scientific article ( in collaboration with Prof. L. Andreev ) as a student in 1982 . This article has dealt with kinetic properties of quantum crystals . From 1984 he turned to quantum field theory and made very important contributions to string theory . Knizhnik died of a heart attack at the very young age of 25 .

 = Paul Karrer =   
Professor Paul Karrer FRS FRSE FCS ( 21 April 1889 – 18 June 1971 ) was a Swiss organic chemist best known for his research on vitamins . He and Norman Haworth won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1937 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
    
    
 === Early years ===   
 Karrer was born in Moscow , Russia to Paul Karrer and Julie Lerch , both Swiss nationals . In 1892 Karrer 's family returned to Switzerland where he was educated at Wildegg and at the grammar school in Lenzburg , Aarau , where he matriculated in 1908 . He studied chemistry at the University of Zurich under Alfred Werner and after gaining his Ph.D. in 1911 , he spent a further year as assistant in the Chemical Institute . He then took a post as chemist with Paul Ehrlich at the Georg Speyer Haus , Frankfurt-am-Main . In 1919 he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical Institute .   
    
    
 === Research ===   
 Karrer 's early research concerned complex metal compounds but his most important work has concerned plant pigments , particularly the yellow carotenoids . He elucidated their chemical structure and showed that some of these substances are transformed in the body into vitamin A . His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for beta-carotene , the chief precursor of vitamin A ; the first time that the structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established . George Wald worked briefly in Karrer 's lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the retina . Later , Karrer confirmed the structure of ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) and extended his researches into the vitamin B2 and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the flavins led to identification of lactoflavin as part of the complex originally thought to be vitamin B2 .   
 Karrer published many papers , and received many honours and awards , including the Nobel Prize in 1937 . His textbook Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie ( Textbook of Organic Chemistry ) was published in 1927 , went through thirteen editions , and was published in seven languages .   
    
    
 === Personal life ===   
 Karrer was married to Helena Froelich in 1914 and had three sons , one of whom died in infancy . He died on 18 June 1971 , at the age of 82 in Zürich . His wife died in 1972 .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 The prestigious Paul Karrer Gold Medal and lecture was established in his honour in 1959 by a group of leading companies such as CIBA AG , J.R. Geigy , F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG , Sandoz AG , Société des Produits Nestlé AG and Dr. A . Wander AG . It is awarded annually or biannually to an outstanding chemist who delivers a lecture at the University of Zurich.The Paul Karrer Lecture Foundation is based at the Chemistry Institute of the University of Zurich at Rämistrasse 71 , in Zürich .

 = Wilhelm Olbers Focke =   
Wilhelm Olbers Focke ( 5 April 1834 , Bremen – 29 September 1922 , Bremen ) was a medical doctor and botanist who in 1881 published a significant work on plant breeding entitled Die Pflanzen-Mischlinge , Ein Beitrag zur Biologie der Gewächse ( The plant hybrids , a contribution to the biology of plants ) which briefly mentioned Gregor Mendel 's discoveries on hybridization . Although Charles Darwin had a copy of Focke 's book he passed it along to a colleague apparently without reading this particular section . The rediscovery of Mendel 's work is generally considered to have taken place in the first years of the 20th century , however in Die Pflanzen-Mischlinge , Mendel is mentioned about 18 times - although Focke did not apparently take Mendel 's work all that seriously . Along with hybridization , Focke analyzed the non-Mendelian phenomena of graft hybrids , pseudogamy , and xenia .   
 In 1889 Focke conducted an inquiry into the former occurrence of malaria in Northern Germany . He also did much of the work throughout his life on the taxonomy of Rubus ( Rosaceae ) and published several studies ( 1877-1914 ) . He wrote a number of section monographs for Adolf Engler and Karl Anton Eugen Prantl eds . Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien in the family Rosaceae , notably regarding fruit-bearing plants of that family .   
 Much of his other output was published in the Bremen periodical : Abhandlungen : Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein zu Bremen , a complete list of the published papers in this periodical is available . On examining the Focke entries on this list of articles , one can appreciate the wide range of subjects that he studied as well as the industry with which he applied himself to his work .

 = Paul Pfurtscheller =   
Paul Pfurtscheller ( 20 November 1855 Salzburg - 5 February 1927 ) was an Austrian zoologist and natural history artist who produced a series of 'Zoologischen Wandtafeln ' ( Zoological Wall Charts ) from 1902 onwards . Such charts were initially used only in German-speaking countries , but their use soon became common elsewhere .   
 Pfurtscheller finished his schooling in 1874 , and enrolled at the University of Vienna . In 1879 he was awarded a PhD degree and licensed to teach science . The next six years saw him teaching at the Franz-Josef Gymnasium , and then for three more years at a high school in Vienna . He then returned to the Franz-Josef Gymnasium , remaining there until his retirement in January 1911 . From 1877 he was a member of the Zoological and Botanical Society .   
 Although he received no formal art training , he created the wall charts to illustrate his teaching lessons , and these were later used by the University Zoological Institute and highly regarded by eminent zoologists . He completed 38 plates and work on the 39th , which showed a dissection of the Oriental cockroach , was halted by his death , but was later completed .   
 The charts were originally published by ' A . Pichler 's Witwe & Sohn und Buchhandlung Lehrmittelanstalt ' , a bookstore specialising in educational literature and teaching aids in Vienna and Leipzig . Sold individually , they were often varnished , resulting in a yellowish appearance with ageing . The first five charts went on sale in 1902 , and some 70 in total were planned . The charts were last listed in a Martinus Nijhoff catalogue in 1953 .

 = Campegius Vitringa =   
Campegius Vitringa Sr. , or Kempe Vitringa ( born at Leeuwarden , May 16 , 1659 ; died at Franeker , March 31 , 1722 ) was a Dutch Protestant theologian and Hebraist . His youngest of four children was Campeius Vitringa ( 1693-1723 ) .   
 Vitringa , a follower of Johannes Cocceius , was a supporter of prophetic theology . He was educated at the universities of Franeker and Leiden , and became professor of Oriental languages at the former in 1681 . When locating prophetic outcomes , he would associate events to the near rather than the far-off future , placing a distinct focus on the period of the Maccabees ( 2nd Century BC ) . Like Joseph Mede ( 1586-1638 ) , Vitringa believed wholeheartedly that the Millennium was yet to come , but did not expect any immediate changes . He relegated the end of the time to a remote future and strongly emphasized the concept of New Jerusalem . His most important student is considered Herman Venema ( 1697-1787 ) , who was a theology professor at Franeker.Vitringa ’ s two chief works are his dissertation on the synagogue , De Synagoga Vetere Libri Tres ( Franeker , 1685 ; 2d ed . 1696 ) ; and his Commentary on Isaiah ( Leeuwarden , 1714–20 ) , which was frequently republished in the eighteenth century . The latter was up to the time of Gesenius the most considerable contribution to the exegesis of Isaiah . His other works include , Sacrarum Observationum Libri Sex ( Franeker , 1683-1708 ) and Anacrisis Apocalypseos Joannis Apostoli ( 1705 ) .   
    
    
 == Anacrisis Apocalypseos ==   
    
 Vitringa ’ s most notable work was Anacrisis Apocalypseos Joannis Apostoli ( 1705 ) , which was considered a major event , in the history of prophetic theology at the turn of the 18th century . He drew extensively on the Clavis Apocalyptica ( 1627 ) , by Joseph Mede ( 1586-1638 ) . Vitringa ’ s work was regarded the first major study to analyze the Book of Revelation as a structured chronological outline of the history of the Christian church . His interpretation of the Apocalypse was that of a coded description of the history of the New Testament Church . Though Vitringa had integrated the historical method of Hugo Grotius in past work , he rejected the view of Grotius and Bossuet that associated John ’ s visions exclusively to early Christendom .

The major asset of his scientific work is integrated in nine studies on waveguides published between the years 1912 and 1939 . They evaluated , on the basis of the Maxwell equations , the effect of radiation by electromagnetic waves in space using conductible and non-conductible cylinders , tubes and their combinations , organized in different ways . The results of Záviška 's experiments were groundbreaking , but they were published in Czech journals only and never became known abroad.In January 1944 , the Nazi Gestapo arrested him on suspicion of resistance activities . He was imprisoned first in Prague and Brno , and later in the concentration camps of Mauthausen and Osterode ( de ) . He died April 17 , 1945 as a result of exhaustion during a death march from the concentration camp .

 = Edward Grainger =   
Edward Grainger ( 1797–1824 ) was an English teacher of anatomy and dresser to Sir Astley Cooper . Grainger opened an anatomical school in Webb Street , Southwark , London in 1819 after his offer to teach at Guy 's Hospital was rejected .   
 The school was successful until the College of Surgeons changed their by-laws to squeeze the independent schools . The Webb Street school was continued by Edward 's brother , Richard Dugard Grainger , after Edward 's early death .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Grainger was born in Birmingham and was the elder son of Edward Grainger , who was a surgeon and later the author of Medical and Surgical Remarks ( 1815 ) . After receiving medical instruction from his father , he entered as a student at the united hospitals of St. Thomas 's and Guy 's in October 1816 . He was a dresser to Sir Astley Cooper , who advised him to open an anatomical school in Birmingham after he had become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons . When Charles Aston Key was appointed demonstrator of anatomy by Cooper , Grainger was anxious to be made joint demonstrator with him . Failing in that , he opened an anatomical school and dissecting-room of his own in June 1819 . Grainger 's school was located in the large attic of a tailor 's house in St. Saviour 's Churchyard , Southwark.Grainger began with 30 pupils and was successful . In the autumn of 1819 , he moved to a location close to Guy 's in Webb Street , Maze Pond , in a building had been used as a Roman Catholic chapel . Grainger 's school had the favour of the resurrection men , speedily rivalled the hospital schools , and drew pupils from them . In 1821 he built a theatre in Webb Street and was joined by John Armstrong and Richard Phillips . Despite obstacles put in the way of the students by hospital surgeons in London , especially the council of the Royal College of Surgeons , Grainger 's school grew . In 1823 he built a larger theatre , and the school had nearly 300 pupils.Grainger died from consumption at his father 's house in Birmingham , on 13 January 1824 , having not quite completed his twenty-seventh year .

Professor Michael J. Reed ( 30 May 1944 – 6 April 2009 ) was a British chemist who held the position of professor of steroid biochemistry at Imperial College , London .   
    
    
 == Scientific career ==   
 Reed obtained a BSc in zoology from the University of London in 1967 and an MSc in biochemistry from Imperial College in 1969 . He then commenced research into the actions and metabolism of ethinyloestradiol with Ken Fotherby at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School , London , culminating in a PhD in 1973 . He continued to work on the regulation of oestrogen synthesis in endometrial cancer before moving to St Mary 's Hospital Medical School in 1976 , to join Vivian James in the Department of Chemical Pathology . He then focused his attention to the regulation of aromatase in breast cancer .   
 Reed was appointed lecturer at St. Mary 's in 1978 , senior lecturer in 1983 and reader in 1992 . His principal work was on in vivo methods , using radioactive substrate infusions to calculate the extent of aromatisation in postmenopausal women with breast cancer . In 1995 he was appointed professor of steroid biochemistry in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Medicine .   
 After the creation of the Imperial College School of Medicine , Reed 's research became more directed towards developing therapies . Together with A. Purohit , he developed a research programme in steroid sulphatase inhibitors for the control of steroid-responsive cancers . These studies attracted commercial funding and the creation of an Imperial Start-up – Sterix Ltd , formed in 1998 as a spin-off from Imperial College , London and the University of Bath , based on the work of Reed and Barry V L Potter ( professor of medicinal chemistry , University of Bath ) in the field of steroid hormones . It resulted the development of inhibitors for several steroidogenic enzyme targets . One of these completed a Phase 1 trial in women with advanced breast cancer , in collaboration with Charles Coombes and CRUK . Sterix was acquired by Ipsen in 2004 .   
    
    
 == Awards and honours ==   
 Reed won the 2009 GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) International Achievement Award , jointly with Barry Potter . He also won The Royal Society of Chemistry BMCS Malcolm Campbell Memorial Award 2009 , jointly with L.W.L . Woo and B.V.L . Potter from The University of Bath and A. Purohit from Imperial College .   
 A commemorative symposium was held on 6 April 2010 in Edinburgh to celebrate his scientific achievements . The symposium focused on the main area of Reed 's research – the production and role of female sex hormones in women with hormone-dependent cancers .

 = Ferenc Fejt C5 91 =   
Ferenc Fejtő ( French : François Fejtő ; August 31 , 1909 – June 2 , 2008 ) was a Hungarian-born French journalist and political scientist , specializing in Eastern Europe .   
 He was born in Nagykanizsa to a well-off Jewish Hungarian family of booksellers and publishers . Following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , several members of his family became Yugoslavian , Italian , Czechoslovak and Romanian citizens .   
 He studied literature at Pécs and Budapest universities , alongside Slavic , German and Italian students . In 1932 , he was condemned to a year in prison for organizing a Marxist study group . In 1934 , he enrolled in the Social Democratic Party , where he contributed to the Népszava daily and to the Szocializmus journal . In 1935 , together with the poet Attila József and the publicist Pál Ignotus , he founded the anti-fascist and anti-Stalinist literary journal Szép Szó . He published Sartre , Mounier , and Maritain . In 1938 , following a sentence of six months in prison for an article criticizing the pro-German stance of the government , he left Hungary for France . During the Second World War , he took part in the French Resistance .   
 In 1945 , François Fejtő headed the press department of the Hungarian embassy in Paris . He resigned his position in protest against the condemnation of his longtime friend László Rajk , and cut all links with Hungary . He returned to his native country only once , for Imre Nagy 's national funeral in 1989 .   
 After the war , Fejtő attended the Congrès des intellectuels pour la liberté , alongside Raymond Aron , François Bondy , and David Rousset . The publication in 1952 of his book A History of the People 's Democracies ( translated in seventeen languages and re-edited several times ) earned him suspicion on the part of several intellectual figures close to the French Communist Party .   
 Between 1944 and 1979 he worked at the Agence France-Presse as a journalist commenting on Eastern European events . He acquired French citizenship in 1955 . Between 1972 and 1984 , he taught at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris . In 1973 , a jury presided over by Raymond Aron granted him the title of docteur ès lettres for his literary output .   
 François Fejtő devoted most of his journalistic and literary career to the study of Eastern European regimes . In his lifetime , he observed their birth , growth , decline and fall .   
 He also contributed to numerous French and non-French journals and newspapers , including Esprit , Arguments , Contre-Point , Commentaire , Le Monde , Le Figaro , La Croix , Il Giornale , La Vanguardia , Magyar Hírlap and The European Journal of International Affairs .   
 François Fejtő remains one of the great European intellectual figures of the 20th century . Close friends with Nizan , Mounier and Camus , critical interlocutor of Malraux and Sartre , he met with leaders of the Comintern and the Communist movement , talked to the masters of the Kremlin , to Tito , Castro and Willy Brandt , and both admired and criticized Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand . On his death , Hungary declared a period of national mourning .

Methodios Fouyias ( Greek : Μεθόδιος Φούγιας ; 12 September 1924 in Corinth – 7 July 2006 ) served as Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain ( concomitantly apokrisiarios of the Ecumenical Patriarch to the Archbishop of Canterbury ) from 1979 to 1988 . After studies in the Theological Faculty of the University of Athens and parochial responsibilities in Munich , he served in various positions within the Patriarchate of Alexandria culminating in that of Metropolitan of Axum covering Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa . Fouiyas ' studies and encounters led to a favourable understanding of the Church of England which he saw in some respects as a continuator of the Saxon Church before the Norman Conquest , the Gregorian Reform and most importantly the East–West Schism of 1054 . He was thus seen as the ideal candidate for the post of archbishop in London . Several years experience however of deepening division within Anglicanism led him openly to suggest ( in an article in The Times ) that the road to unity for Anglicans lay in submission to the discipline of the Roman Catholic church . As his post involved close relations with Lambeth it was judged expedient that he should be recalled . Methodios assumed the title of Pisidia and continued his studies ( notably on Bessarion ) in Greece .

 = Theophilus Pinches =   
Theophilus Goldridge Pinches M.R.A.S . ( 1856 – 6 June 1934 Muswell Hill , London ) , was a pioneer British assyriologist .   
 Pinches was originally employed in father 's business as a die-sinker , but , following an amateur interest in cuneiform inscriptions , joined the staff of the British Museum in 1878 , working there as assistant then curator till retirement in 1900 . He was lecturer in Assyriology at University College London and in the University of Liverpool till 1932 or 1933 , and died in 1934.During his tenure at the Egyptian and Assyrian Department , British Museum , he gave assistance to scholars including Abraham Sachs and taught at London University . It was largely due to his `` painstaking work '' during his time as assistant keeper at the British Museum between 1895 and 1900 , that many pieces acquired by the museum were joined together again . He also translated some Babylonian tablets which related to the Battle of the Vale of Siddim and was one of the editors of The Babylonian and Oriental Record from 1886 . In 1890 , Pinches discovered and published the correct reading of the name of Gilgamesh , instead of Izdubar .

 = Arthur A. Meyerhoff =   
Arthur E. Meyerhoff ( 1895–1986 ) was an advertising agency executive and entrepreneur . He was born in Chicago , Illinois .   
 Meyerhoff founded his own agency , Arthur Meyerhoff Associates , in 1932 after persuading the Wm . Wrigley Jr. Company that he could arrange for newspapers to place advertisements for Wrigley chewing gum on their comic pages . He then got the newspapers to agree to the idea .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 During World War II , Philip K. Wrigley was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club . Wrigley decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players . He approached other Major League team owners , but the idea was not well received . Then , four non-Major League cities were selected that were in close proximity to the AAGPBL headquarters in Chicago and close to each other : Rockford of Illinois , South Bend of Indiana and Racine and Kenosha of Wisconsin . Meyerhoff was given the responsibility of coordinating operations with city officials and civic leaders in the communities , as well as a projected budget was developed . In 1943 the league made an auspicious debut , but after the 1944 season Wrigley sold the AAGPBL to Meyerhoff .   
 It was under Meyerhoff management that expansion to six teams , as well as the publicity campaign of the AAGPBL reached its peak . He re-organized the league so that each franchise would be governed through a League Board of Directors with representatives from each franchise . Each club now had a voice in the adoption of rules and regulations and the direction of the sport . All assets were turned over to the new directors and Wrigley was no longer involved with the league . The AAGPBL excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season , when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans.Meyerhoff also organized several companies outside his advertising agency to develop new products . One company he owned developed PAM , a substitute for fats or oils that can be sprayed on pots and pans . In the mid-1950s , when Meyerhoff was looking for a side business , he advertised for ideas and heard from two chemists who had developed something like a cooking spray . First , Meyerhoff had the formula perfected so it could be sprayed ; then he campaigned for grocers to shelve PAM in the baking aisle with the flours , not the aerosol section next to insecticides and hair spray . The name PAM is an initialism for `` Product of Arthur Meyerhoff . ''   
 In the 1960s Meyerhoff wrote his book The Strategy of Persuasion , which reflects his point of views that the United States Information Agency should get out of the news business and into the business of selling democracy abroad . He sold his agency in 1979 .   
 Meyerhoff died on August 29 , 1986 at his home in Rancho Santa Fe , California , at the age of 91 .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Meyerhoff died in September 1986 ; services were held at the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Rancho Santa Fe , California . He was survived by his wife , Elaine ; two sons , Arthur E. Meyerhoff Jr. and Dr. William L. Meyerhoff ; three daughters , Judith Meyerhoff Yale , Jane Meyerhoff Bussier and Joanne Meyerhoff .

Knut Getz Wold ( 3 August 1915 – 9 October 1987 ) was a Norwegian economist and civil servant , who served as the governor of the Central Bank of Norway from 1970 to 1985 .   
 He was born in Verdal in Nord-Trøndelag , as a son of district physician Trygve Wold ( 1879–1939 ) and Anna Ella Getz ( 1893–1960 ) . He graduated from the University of Oslo with cand.oecon . degree in 1939 . He lost his brother Torolf during the Norwegian Campaign on 4 May 1940.He started working with research at the university , and studied further at Stockholm College in 1940 . In 1941 he started working for the Ministry of Finance-in-exile in the United Kingdom . From July 1947 to March 1948 he served as a State Secretary in the Ministry of Social Affairs . Wold represented the Liberal Party , and Gerhardsen 's Second Cabinet in which he was appointed was a Labour cabinet . This discrepancy is very uncommon in Norwegian history .   
 In 1948 he returned to the civil servant role when he became deputy under-secretary of state in the Ministry of Trade . In his diaries he described the Ministry of Trade as `` not [ ... ] a ministry , but a Brain Trust of young economists '' .

Jean-Baptiste-Michel Bucquet ( French : [ bykɛ ] ; 18 February 1746 – 24 January 1780 ) was a French chemist , member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences , physician and public teacher .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Bucquet was born in Paris , in 1746 . He was first sent to study law but he then turned to science and attended classes at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris . There he encountered for the first time chemistry applied to medicine . Despite financial trouble , he graduated in 1770 and thus became Docteur-Régent , and married Marie Claude Leredde shortly after . He then started teaching a public course in chemistry in his own laboratory . Between 1771 and 1773 , Bucquet published a manual of chemistry , first on mineral then on vegetal chemistry , destined for the use of beginners in the science who need a coherent overview of the different processes and products in use . This manual was intended for people attending his course but also for those who could not . Bucquet 's public course carried out for several years , and was mentioned in the Journal de Médecine . In 1775 , Bucquet became professor of pharmacy at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris , and the next year , following the death of Augustin Roux , he took the chair of chemistry at the Faculty . He became part of the French Academy of Sciences as a chemist in 1777 . During his years at the Academy , he published a few works of chemical analysis , including one in collaboration with the duke of La Rochefoucauld . He eventually acquired the laboratory in rue Jacob which used to belong to the chemist Rouelle and carried out his public courses there . He continued giving public courses until 1779 , at which point he became to ill to continue . He was known to be a very good teacher and many attended his courses . He died of his disease in 1780 .   
 His most famous pupil was Antoine-François Fourcroy who later carried on Bucquet 's work on natural history .   
    
    
 == Collaboration with Lavoisier ==   
 In 1777 , Bucquet worked with Antoine Lavoisier at his residence of the Arsenal , performed many fundamental experiments of chemistry , with the aim of checking if there results which were widely used in chemistry , could still be considered reliable . Lavoisier had the financial means and necessary laboratory equipment to perform such a task and Bucquet brought his many years of experience in public demonstration and laboratory expertise . Together , they published 26 memoirs at the Academy of Sciences . which led to Bucquet 's nomination as Academician .

Jerzy Toeplitz AO ( 24 November 1909 – 25 July 1995 ) was born in 1909 in Kharkiv ( at that time in Russia ) . He was educated in Warsaw . After World War II he was the co-founder of the Polish Film School , and later took up an appointment in Australia for the Film and TV School .   
 Between 1948 and 1972 he was Vice-President of the International Film and Television Council ( USA ) . In 1959 , he was a member of the jury at the 1st Moscow International Film Festival . Two years later , he was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.He was also an author and published a number of books which have been translated into many languages . Toeplitz also , for almost 30 years ( 1948–1971 ) , was the president of the International Federation of Films Archives ( FIAF ) , where he accomplished a very important role , overall in the Cold War conjuncture , especially into a very big crisis of the FIAF 's history ( perhaps the worst ) , when Henri Langlois ( one of the Cinemathèquè Française 's founders ) left the FIAF . Toeplitz 's job was a very important differential ( typical of his generation ) because he was a cinema 's teacher and a leader of an educational project in the Polish city of Łódź ( a reference into the period ) . This school had a decisive impact on the modern cinema in Poland .   
 In 1985 he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia for his services to Australian film . In 1986 , he was a member of the jury at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival .

In 1859 he became engineer in chief of mines , and in 1861 , upon the death of Louis Cordier , he was appointed professor of geology at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris and was also elected member of the French Academy of Sciences . In the following year he became professor of mineralogy at the École des Mines , and in 1872 director of that school . In 1878 Daubrée was elected vice-president and in 1879 president of the French Academy of Sciences . In 1880 the Geological Society of London awarded to him the Wollaston medal . In 1881 he was promoted to Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour.His published researches date from 1841 , when the origin of certain tin minerals attracted his attention ; he subsequently discussed the formation of bog-iron ore , and worked out in detail the geology of the Bas-Rhin ( 1852 ) . From 1857 to 1861 , while engaged in engineering works connected with the springs of Plombieres , he made a series of interesting observations on thermal waters and their influence on the Roman masonry through which they made their exit . He was , however , especially distinguished for his long-continued and often dangerous experiments on the artificial production of minerals and rocks . He likewise discussed the permeability of rocks by water , and the effects of such infiltration in producing volcanic phenomena ; he dealt with the subject of metamorphism , with the deformations of the Earth 's crust , with earthquakes , and with the composition and classification of meteorites.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1881 , a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892 , and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1895.He died in Paris on 29 May 1896 .

 = Yurii Shirokov =   
Yurii Shirokov , ( Широков , Юрий Михайлович 21.6.1921—5.7.1980 ) , writer , physicist , professor .   
 Graduated from Moscow State University ( Moscow ) in 1948 . Worked in the same university , then in the Steklov Mathematical Institute ( Moscow ) . He wrote more than 100 scientific papers   
    
 and several monographs , among which the textbook `` Nuclear Physics '' is particularly relevant .   
 .   
    
    
 == Algebra of generalized functions ==   
 Yu.Shirokov had constructed the Algebra of Generalized functions . Then it was applied to various systems   
 .   
    
    
 == Classical and quantum mechanics ==   
 Shirokov was , perhaps , not the first to mention that quantum mechanics has many classical limits . The Planck constant   
    
    
    
    
 ℏ   
    
    
    
 { \displaystyle ~\hbar ~ }   
 appears in many relations , and there are many options to keep some of parameters ( or even to vary them all ) as   
    
    
    
    
 ℏ   
 →   
 0   
    
    
    
 { \displaystyle ~\hbar \rightarrow 0~ }   
 . The most known limiting cases of quantum mechanics are classical waves and Newtonian mechanics . Shirokov has systematised the construction of classical limits of quantum mechanics , see   
 .   
    
    
 == Development of Shirokov 's ideas ==   
 The most important ideas about the quantum mechanics and the theoretical physics in general formulated by   
 Shirokov are not yet developed . In particular , the field theory in terms of wave packets ( i.e. , without divergent terms and without divergent series ) is not yet constructed .

 = Johann Bauhin =   
Johann ( or Jean ) Caspar Bauhin ( 12 December 1541 – 26 October 1613 ) was a Swiss botanist , born in Basel . He was the son of physician Jean Bauhin and the brother of physician and botanist Gaspard Bauhin .   
 Johann Bauhin studied botany at Tübingen under Leonhart Fuchs ( 1501–1566 ) . He then travelled with Conrad Gessner , after which he started a practice of medicine at Basel , where he was elected Professor of Rhetoric in 1566 . Four years later he was invited to become the physician to Frederick I , Duke of Württemberg at Montbéliard , in the Franche-Comté where he remained until his death . He devoted himself chiefly to botany . His great work , Historia plantarum universalis , a compilation of all that was then known about botany , remained incomplete at his death , but was published at Yverdon in 1650–1651 .   
 Bauhin nurtured several botanic gardens and also collected plants during his travels . In 1591 , he published a list of plants named after saints called De Plantis a Divis Sanctisve Nomen Habentibus .   
 Johann Bauhin died in Montbéliard .   
 Carl Linnaeus named the genus Bauhinia ( family Caesalpiniaceae ) for the brothers Johann and Gaspard Bauhin .

 = Valentin Berlinsky =   
Valentin Berlinsky ( January 19 , 1925 – December 15 , 2008 ) was a Russian cellist . He was a member of the world-famous Borodin Quartet in 1945 and was a member until 2007 . He was the only Quartet member to have played in it from the beginning . Berlinsky played for the Borodin Quartet for 60 years , making him the longest-serving member of what The New York Times described as being `` by all accounts the longest continuously playing '' string quartet in the world.The group originally came together in 1945 as the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet with Mstislav Rostropovich on cello , Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai on first and second violins and Rudolf Barshai on viola , all members of a class taken by Mikhail Terian , the viola player of the Comitas Quartet . However , after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy and nominated Berlinsky in his place . They signed an oath of allegiance in their own blood which Berlinsky retained . He also maintained a complete log of their many performances.The quartet first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946 and became his interpreter . The group was known for its performances of all 15 quartets in the Shostakovich quartet cycle at concert halls around the world , including in 1994 at Alice Tully Hall in New York City.The quartet was one of the Soviet Union 's best known in the West during the Cold War era , through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings . As one of the most revered groups during the Communist era , the quartet performed at the funerals of both Joseph Stalin and Sergei Prokofiev , who both died on March 5 , 1953.After 20 years with the same line-up difficult times followed in the 1970s : Dubinsky emigrated to the West in 1976 and the second violinist , Jaroslav Alexandrov , retired through ill-health . Having recruited replacements , Berlinsky insisted that the ensemble spend two years out of sight until the Borodin sound had been fully recreated.Berlinsky was a very loyal Russian . In 2000 he said : `` I have never condemned those who left . It 's difficult to describe in words why I stayed , but for me it was nothing to do with cheap patriotism . It was just that Russia is my fatherland ; I could n't imagine living anywhere else . '' For much of his life he taught at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow , nurturing many talented young players.Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk , Siberia , on January 19 , 1925 . He took violin lessons from his father , who had been a pupil of Leopold Auer and who , with his three brothers , played as the Berlinsky Quartet in that part of the Soviet Union . He was soon sent to Moscow to study at the Moscow Conservatory . He had one daughter , Ludmila Valentinovna Berlinskaya .   
 Valentin Berlinsky retired from the Borodin Quartet in September 2007 , and was succeeded by his protégé , Vladimir Balshin , but he still remained the group 's mentor.Berlinsky died at age 83 on the night of December 15 , 2008 , in Moscow , after a long illness.The quartet 's oath and the complete list of their performances together with chronological events taken from his own diaries were compiled and edited by his granddaughter , Maria Matalaev , and his biography published in Valentin Berlinsky : A Quartet for Life ( 2018 ) .

 = Howard C. Whisler =   
Howard C. Whisler ( 1931–2007 ) was an American mycologist . Born in Oakland , California , he attended Berkeley schools and then Palo Alto High School . Howard worked on his undergraduate degree at Oregon State College for two years and then went to the University of California , Berkeley , where he completed a Bachelor of Science degree in plant pathology in 1954 . He joined the United States Air Force from 1954 to 1956 stationed in Italy . He returned to University of California , Berkeley after his military life and had finished his doctoral degree with Ralph Emerson in 1960 . From 1960 to 1961 he held a post doctoral NATO-NSF Fellowship in France , at the Université de Montpellier . Howard was appointed assistant professor of Botany at McGill University in 1961 . He was appointed to the faculty at the University of Washington on March 15 , 1963 and worked until he died on September 16 , 2007 , at the age of 76 . [ 1,2 ]   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Whisler had great admiration for Roland Thaxter and Cap Weston . When Whisler was an undergraduate at the University of California , Berkeley , he was introduced to the study of zoosporic fungi . During his graduate work at University of California , Berkeley he focused on fungi associated with invertebrates , receiving his doctorate in 1960 for a study of the entomogenous fungus Amoebidium parasiticum ( Protozoan ) . He published his first paper on Amoebidium parasiticum ( Protozoan ) on Daphnia in the journal Nature in 1960 . After that , he published a number of articles on zoosporic fungi . [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] Additional publications included those on the Trichomycetes , Entomophthorales , Rubetella inopinata and Carouxella scalaris , with J. F. Manier and L . Rioux . [ 4 ] He published many articles on the biology of Coelomomyces . [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] From 1970 , he did some research on members of the Oomycota , insect parasites in the Zygomycota and Ascomycota , and even delved for a bit into the Basidiomycota with G. A. Escobar , D. E. McCabe and C. W . Harpel . [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] Whisler was an active member of the Mycological Society of America . He was also a founder of the International Society of Evolutionary Protistology with Max Taylor and Lynn Margulis . [ 2 ] Whisler taught a number of graduate students who worked on aquatic fungi . He also followed Emerson 's tradition of allowing his students to be sole authors on papers from his lab even though his direction and collaboration were often an important component of the research . So when counted his publication , this articles must be included .

Adriaan Loosjes ( 1761 , in Texel – 1818 , in Haarlem ) , was a 19th-century botanist , poet , novelist and publisher born in Den Hoorn , North Holland , Netherlands .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He came from a family of Mennonite ministers and was an active member of the Doopsgezinde kerk , Haarlem , where he started his first literary society in 1777 , Honos alit artes . In 1779 he started another one called Vlijt moeder der Wetenschappen that began to annually announce contests with a prize similar to the Teylers Eerste Genootschap that was founded the year before . In 1782 these two societies were merged and also began to produce plays , which Loosjes wrote , acted , and published himself , becoming a Haarlem bookseller . In the same year Jan van Walré joined to become an actor , and under his influence , in 1785 the society was reinvented as the theater society Leerzaam vermaak with a strong Patriotic bias with Loosjes and Walré the leaders . When the House of Orange briefly enjoyed a contrarevolution , Leerzaam vermaak was banned , and Loosjes decided to avoid politics and relinquished his official roles in the group , spending his time on scientific and writing pursuits . In 1789 he started the Haarlem scientific society Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen . To continue with his comedies , he began the society Democriet in the same year with the remark Because Heraclitus had to cry , Democritus had to laugh . In 1790 Walré joined , who again added political color , despite Loosjes ' intentions to remain neutral . In 1795 when the French occupation began , the activities of Democriet reached their peak , and after that moment the society began to show similarities with freemasonry.Loosjes wrote several books and plays , and translated historical works from English into Dutch . He succeeded his father Petrus Loosjes as a member of Teylers Eerste Genootschap from 1813 until his own death in 1818 . His son Vincent Loosjes continued his publishing business .

Edward William Nelson ( 1883–1923 ) was a British marine biologist and polar explorer . Educated at Clifton , Tonbridge and Cambridge , he was independently wealthy . He worked at the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom ( MBA ) in Plymouth and was member of the 1910–1913 British Antarctic Expedition . in association with E. J. Allen , he developed a simple method for culturing phytoplankton .   
    
    
 == Polar expedition ==   
 In 1910 , he joined the British Antarctic Expedition ( popularly known as `` The Terra Nova Expedition '' ) led by Robert Falcon Scott , and served as a biologist . He took part in a sledging journey to `` One Ton Depot '' , carrying food supplies for the returning polar party . He also conducted tidal observations while at Cape Evans and was later awarded the Polar Medal along with the other Terra Nova members . He was commemorated with `` Nelson Cliff '' at the west side of the Simpson Glacier in Antarctica ( 71°14′S , 168°42′E ) .   
    
    
 == Later career ==   
 On his return from the Antarctic , Nelson worked as Senior Naturalist at the laboratory in Plymouth , taking leave to fight with the British 63rd ( Royal Naval ) Division in the Gallipoli campaign , then later in the trenches of France . In 1920 the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food approached the MBA to propose that the Association undertake the manufacture of a large number of `` Drift Bottles '' , to be used in tracking the movement of the waters of the North Sea . By this time , Nelson was the Scientific Superintendent of the Fisheries Board for Scotland , and wrote a paper on the manufacture of the drift bottles for the Association 's Journal . He was found dead in his laboratory 17 January , 1923 , the result of a self-injected poison . An inquest into his death was reported in The Times newspaper.Over 80 years later , his daughter Barbara , then 93 , died during a trip to Antarctica in 2009

 = Jesse Macy =   
Jesse Macy ( June 21 , 1842 – November 2 , 1919 ) was an American political scientist and historian of the late 19th and early 20th century , specializing in the history of American political parties , party systems , and the Civil War . He spent most of his professional career at his alma mater , Grinnell College .   
 Jesse Macy , the thirteenth of fourteen children , was born to Quaker parents in Indiana , but the family moved to central Iowa in 1856 and started farming outside Lynnville , near the newly founded town of Grinnell . At age 17 , he entered Iowa College , now Grinnell College . During the Civil War , he served in the Union army and he did not graduate until after the war , earning an A.B . in 1870.During the 1870s , Macy started what would become a long-term correspondence with James Bryce , a noted British jurist and politician . In 1884 , he completed his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University . The next year , he returned to the Midwest to take a professorship at Iowa College . For the next forty-two years , Macy taught history and political science at the college.In the 1890s , Macy defended radical aspects of the burgeoning social gospel taught at Iowa College by professor of Applied Christianity George Herron and college president George A . Gates . Macy supported liberal education in a newspaper article , saying :   
    
 Suppose some emissary of darkness had spied out our liberty and had arraigned Iowa College before the public as a place where young people were taught the dangerous doctrine of evolution . It may be that at so early a date the young professors would have been sent adrift and the public would have been assured that Iowa College was a place where only safe opinions were allowed ! That is a place where only imbeciles and hypocrites are educated .   
 He was also a leading author of political science textbooks . Macy 's 1896 manual on American civil government , Our Government . How It Grew , What It Does , And How it Does It , was an influential primer for university students and his 1897 The English Constitution : A Commentary on its Nature and Growth was acclaimed for providing the necessary foundation in English law to correctly understand American law.In his 1904 work Party Organization and Machinery Macy wrote , `` While our party system is without Old World models , it is strikingly in harmony with our other forms of political activity ... . '' and `` Various references to party and faction found in The Federalist illustrate the type of American ideas which prevailed before the American party system appeared '' ( pp . xiv-xvi ) . The work also included a whole chapter entitled `` Effect of the City upon the Party System '' .   
 In 1911 , Grinnell awarded Macy an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.After retiring in 1912 , Macy traveled widely and continued writing until his death in 1919.In February 2008 , Grinnell 's board of trustees voted to name one of the college office buildings `` Jesse Macy House '' in memory of the long-serving professor . The building , at 1205 Park St. , houses a number of interdisciplinary centers , including the Center for Peace Studies and the Rosenfield Program.Macy 's descendants include SLAC physicist H. Pierre Noyes .

 = Melvin Calvin =   
Melvin Ellis Calvin ( April 8 , 1911 – January 8 , 1997 ) was an American biochemist known for discovering the Calvin cycle along with Andrew Benson and James Bassham , for which he was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry . He spent most of his five-decade career at the University of California , Berkeley .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Calvin was born in St. Paul , Minnesota , the son of Elias Calvin and Rose Herwitz , immigrants from the Russian Empire.As a small child Calvin 's family moved to Detroit ; he graduated from Central High School in 1928 . Melvin Calvin earned his Bachelor of Science from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology ( now known as Michigan Technological University ) in 1931 and his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Minnesota in 1935 . He then spent the next four years doing postdoctoral work at the University of Manchester . He married Marie Genevieve Jemtegaard in 1942 , and they had three children , two daughters and a son .   
 Calvin joined the faculty at the University of California , Berkeley , in 1937 and was promoted to Professor of Chemistry in 1947 . Using the carbon-14 isotope as a tracer , Calvin , Andrew Benson and James Bassham mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis , starting from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds . In doing so , Calvin , Benson and Bassham showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacturing of organic compounds , rather than on carbon dioxide as was previously believed . Calvin was the sole recipient of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for what is sometimes known as the Calvin–Benson–Bassham Cycle . Calvin wrote an autobiography three decades later titled Following the Trail of Light : A Scientific Odyssey .   
 During the 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research . In 1963 he was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology . He was founder and Director of the Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics and simultaneously Associate Director of Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , where he conducted much of his research until his retirement in 1980 . In his final years of active research , he studied the use of oil-producing plants as renewable sources of energy . He also spent many years testing the chemical evolution of life and wrote a book on the subject that was published in 1969 .   
    
    
 == Controversy ==   
 In his 2011 television history of Botany for the BBC , Timothy Walker , Director of the University of Oxford Botanic Garden , criticised Calvin 's treatment of Andrew Benson , claiming that Calvin had got the credit for Benson 's work after firing him , and had failed to mention Benson 's role when writing his autobiography decades later . Benson himself has also mentioned being fired by Calvin , and has complained about not being mentioned in his autobiography .   
    
    
 == Honours and Legacy ==   
 Calvin was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958 . In 1959 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.Calvin was featured on the 2011 volume of the American Scientists collection of US postage stamps , along with Asa Gray , Maria Goeppert-Mayer , and Severo Ochoa . This was the third volume in the series , the first two having been released in 2005 and 2008 .

Alexander Reuben Percy Moore ( 1901–1991 ) was an English ballroom dancer from Stourbridge . He was a pioneer of modern ballroom dancing , a leading adjudicator and organiser , a dance teacher of international renown and the author of classical ballroom dancing texts . His Ballroom Dancing is considered to be the 'Bible ' of International-style ballroom dancing .   
 His dancing career started at the age of 6 . In 1926 he was placed second in a World Championship of ballroom dancing , dancing with his sister . In 1932 he partnered Pat Kilpatrick , who would become his wife . In both his dancing and later his teaching he travelled all over the world .   
 He held the post of Chairman and later President of the ISTD , and was Honorary President of the International Council of Ballroom Dance . From 1932 Alex Moore issued the Alex Moore Monthly Letter Service , a periodical about ballroom dancing , with hints for dancers and instructors and news about dance championships . It was circulated in 40 countries in several languages . His 1936 Ballroom Technique book is the base of the ISTD reference for the category of International Standard . Addressing the need in quick reference , he devised the chart format of the description of ballroom dance figures , used today .

Sir Jack Hibbert ( 14 February 1932 – 23 August 2005 ) was a British statistician and director of the Central Statistical Office ( CSO ) of the United Kingdom , 1985–1992 . He was made a KCB in 1990 .   
    
    
 == Background ==   
 Sir Jack Hibbert was born in Huddersfield , Yorkshire , on 14 February 1932 . He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and the London School of Economics and was married with two sons and one daughter . He died on 23 August 2005 in Weybridge , Surrey .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Hibbert joined the Exchequer and Audit Department in 1952 and then moved to the Central Statistical Office in 1960 , where he worked on economics statistics . He was promoted to chief statistician in 1970 and to assistant director in 1977 . In 1981 , he spent a period on loan to the OECD and to Eurostat as a consultant and then joined the Department of Trade and Industry as a director of statistics . On 1 August 1985 , he was appointed director of the Central Statistical Office in succession to Sir John Boreham . He retired in 1992 .   
    
    
 == Central Statistical Office ==   
 When Jack Hibbert took over the CSO , it had suffered four years of cutbacks following the 'Rayner Review ' of official statistics . Shortly after this , the then Chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson , and other Conservative politicians claimed that misleading statistics were largely responsible for the Government 's poor handling of the economy . The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee recommended ' a thorough review into the operation of various Departments involved in the collection of national accounts statistics ' . The review , by Stephen Pickford , recommended that there should be just one organisation responsible for the collection and compilation of statistics for national accounts .   
 This meant moving the Business Statistics Office and responsibility for data on imports and exports from the Department of Trade and Industry , and responsibility for the Retail Prices Index from the Department of Employment . The changes , in July 1989 , increased the CSO from just under 170 staff to about 1,000 . This was probably the biggest shake-up of official statistics since the creation of the CSO in 1941 . Jack Hibbert had the difficult job of creating this new organisation .

 = Claude Frassen =   
Claude Frassen ( 1620 – 26 February 1711 ) was a French Franciscan Scotist theologian and philosopher .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Frassen was born near Péronne , France . He entered the Franciscan Order at Peronne in his seventeenth year ; and after the year of novitiate was sent to Paris , where he completed his studies and remained for thirty years as professor of philosophy and theology . In 1662 he was made doctor of the Sorbonne , and as definitor general , to which office he was elected in 1682 , he took part in the general chapters of the order at Toledo and Rome .   
 Outside of the order his counsel was sought not only by ecclesiastics but likewise by secular dignitaries , Louis XIV of France , in particular , holding him in high esteem . He died in Paris , at the age of 91 years , 74 of which he had spent in religion .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
    
 Scotus Academicus ( 1901 ) , the best known of the writings of Frassen . This work is rightly considered one of the most important and scholarly presentations of the theology of Duns Scotus . Few , if any , of the numerous interpreters and commentators of Scotus have succeeded so well as Frassen in combining simplicity of style and clearness of method with that subtleness of thought which characterizes Scotistic theology as a whole . The value of the work is enhanced by frequent quotations from the Church Fathers , and by an impartial statement of all controversial questions in scholastic theology . The first volume is prefaced with a chronological list and a brief historical and dogmatical account of the different heresies from the beginnings of Christianity to the fifteenth century . The edition of the Scotus Academicus published by the Friars Minor ( Rome , 1900–02 , in twelve volumes ) was prepared from notes left by the author himself and preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris . Earlier editions were those of Paris ( 1672–77 ) , Rome ( 1721 ) , Venice ( 1744 ) .

 Zeisel was born in Kadaň , Bohemia in 1905 , and soon afterward moved with his family to Vienna , Austria , where he grew up . He received his doctorates in law and political science from the University of Vienna in 1927 .   
    
    
 == Early career ==   
 After receiving his doctorates , Zeisel worked with Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda on the 1933 study Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal , which David Kaye has called `` a celebrated study of the impact of the Depression and unemployment on a small Austrian town . '' Similarly , University of Chicago professor Friedrich Katz said of Marienthal that `` The book had a profound effect , not only in Austria , but everywhere '' . Also after graduating from the University of Vienna , he practiced law and engaged in pro-socialism activism until 1938 , when he emigrated to New York City in response to the Anschluss Österreichs . In New York , he became influential in the fields of media market research , and his research in these areas led to the 1947 statistics book Say It with Figures .   
    
    
 == Later career ==   
 Zeisel joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1953 to study the American jury system with Harry Kalven . The research Zeisel and Kalven conducted on the jury system produced two books : Delay in the Court ( 1959 ) and The American Jury . After retiring from the University of Chicago , he continued conducting research , especially on capital punishment ( of which he was a firm opponent ) and trademark infringement . In 1977 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association . One of the last works he wrote discussed the limits of using statistical methods to study the legal system . This book was posthumously published in 1997 as Prove It with Figures .   
    
    
 == Death ==   
 Zeisel died at his home in 1992 .

 = Konstantin Feoktistov =   
Konstantin Petrovich Feoktistov ( Russian : Константин Петрович Феоктистов ; 7 February 1926 – 21 November 2009 ) was a Soviet cosmonaut and an eminent space engineer . Feoktistov also wrote several books on space technology and exploration . The Feoktistov crater on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 During the Nazi occupation of Voronezh , at the age of just 16 , Feoktistov fought with the Soviet Army against the German troops , carrying out reconnaissance missions for the Voronezh Front . After being captured by a Waffen-SS Army patrol , Feoktistov was shot by a German officer . However , the bullet went right through his chin and neck and did not kill him . Feoktistov was able to crawl out later and then make his way to the Soviet lines .   
 After the war was over , Feoktistov enrolled in the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as an engineering student and he graduated in 1949 . Feoktistov also later earned a doctorate in physics . He joined Mikhail Tikhonravov 's OKB ( design bureau ) , and in 1955 , Feoktistov formed part of the team that went on to design the Sputnik satellites , the Vostok space capsule , the Voskhod space capsule , and the Soyuz space capsule under the leadership of the Soviet Chief Designer Sergey Korolev . During this time , Feoktistov also worked on a design for an ion-propelled spacecraft to be capable of taking humans to Mars .   
 In 1964 , Feoktistov was selected as part of a group of engineers for cosmonaut training , and in October of that very same year , he was hastily assigned to the multi-disciplinary Voskhod 1 crew . He was the first civilian to make a space flight , and the only cosmonaut in the Soviet Union who was not a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . During his space flight , he spent just over 24 hours and 17 minutes in space.After the flight of Voskhod 1 , Feoktistov 's training for any further space mission was discontinued for medical reasons . However , Feoktistov continued his outer space engineering work , and he later became the head of the Soviet space design bureau that designed the Salyut and Mir space stations .   
 In October 1969 , Konstantin Feoktistov and Georgi Beregovoi traveled as guests of NASA throughout the US , visiting any city they chose and Disneyland in California – they were joined on the trip by US astronauts as hosts , including Eugene Cernan , Neil Armstrong and others . Kirk Douglas and others hosted receptions for them in Hollywood – they were protected by special agents of the US State Department on request of NASA . Almost every place they went when accompanied by Eugene Cernan , if a band was present the song `` Fly Me to the Moon '' was played – when they visited Disneyland they enjoyed the ride Trip To The Moon , then joked with the US astronauts that they went to Disneyland and not the moon . It was a trip that all enjoyed and international friendships were made .   
 Feoktistov resigned from his engineering position with Energia and then returned to Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as a professor in 1990 .

Albertus ( Albert ) Antonie Nijland ( October 30 , 1868 – August 18 , 1936 ) was a Dutch astronomer . He was professor of astronomy at the Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht , and served as director of the Sterrewacht Sonnenborgh ( now the Sterrekundig Instituut ) of the university .   
 Nijland was born in Utrecht . In 1901 he participated in a Dutch solar eclipse expedition to Karang Sago , Sumatra .   
 He was noted for his observations of variable stars , and published a number of papers on the subject in Astronomische Nachrichten , and elsewhere , from 1917 until 1936 . He proposed naming variable stars in each constellation using a simple numbering system beginning with V1 , V2 , ... and so forth . However the double-letter system starting with RR was already in   
 widespread use . As a result , variable stars after QZ were numbered according to Nijland 's system beginning with V335 .   
 In 1923 Nijland became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.The crater Nijland on the Moon is named after him .

 Soloist with major national and international ensembles ( debut with the orchestras of Boston , New York and Philadelphia in 1952 ) , Gousseau particularly distinguished herself in the French music of her time : Chausson , Dukas , Ohana , Schmitt , creating , in particular , the Passacaille by Marcel Mihalovici ( Op . 105 ) and the étude Pour les sonorités de la main gauche by Henri Martelli , two pieces of which she was the dedicatee - although she played and recorded Brahms , Chopin , Schumann and Falla .   
 Lélia Gousseau taught at the Conservatoire de Paris ( 1961-1978 ) as well as at the École Normale de Musique de Paris , where her teaching was distinguished above all by an extreme attention paid to fingering , pedalling , deep playing and legato . Anne Queffélec , Émile Naoumoff , Jean-Pierre Ferey , Maria Tortelier-de la Pau , Alain Raës , Pascal Devoyon and Kaoki Kimura were among her numerous pupils .   
 She toured South Africa in 1954 and 1957.Gousseau died in Paris at age 88 .

 = Vladimir Arsenyev =   
Vladimir Klavdiyevich Arsenyev , ( Russian : Влади́мир Кла́вдиевич Арсе́ньев ; 10 September 1872 – 4 September 1930 ) was a Russian explorer of the Far East who recounted his travels in a series of books — `` По Уссурийскому Краю '' ( `` Along the Ussury land '' ) ( 1921 ) and `` Дерсу Узала '' ( `` Dersu Uzala '' ) ( 1923 ) — telling of his military journeys to the Ussuri basin with Dersu Uzala , a native hunter , from 1902 to 1907 . He was the first to describe numerous species of Siberian flora and the lifestyles of native ethnic peoples .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Arseniev was born in St. Petersburg , Russian Empire . His father , born a serf , became the chief of the Moscow District Railway . After a military education , Arseniev began his expeditions to the forests of the Far East . He lived in Vladivostok through the years of the Russian Civil War and was a Commissar for Ethnic Minorities ( Komisar po delam inrodcheskim ) of the independent Far Eastern Republic . After the Far Eastern Republic was absorbed by Soviet Russia in 1922 Arsenyev refused to emigrate and stayed in Vladivostok .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
    
 Arseniev is most famous for authoring many books about his explorations , including some 60 works on the geography , wildlife and ethnography of the regions he traveled . Arseniev 's most famous book , Dersu Uzala , is a memoir of three expeditions in the Ussurian taiga ( forest ) of Northern Asia along the Sea of Japan and North to Vladivostok . The book is named after Arseniev 's guide , an Ussurian native of the Nanai/Goldi tribe . Eventually the book was made into two films , one by Soviet director Agasi Babayan in 1961 , the other by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in 1975 . The latter Dersu Uzala version won that year 's Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film . The third book of Arsenyev 's trilogy , In the Sikhote-Alin mountains , was published posthumously in 1937 .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Arseniev died in 1930 in Vladivostok at the age of 57 . His widow , Margarita Nikolaevna Arsenieva , was arrested in 1934 and again in 1937 after being accused of being a member of an underground organization of spies and saboteurs allegedly headed by her late husband . The military court hearings of the case ( 21 August 1938 ) took only 10 minutes and sentenced her to death . She was executed immediately . Arsenyev 's daughter Natalya also was arrested in April 1941 and sentenced to the Gulag .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 Arsenyev ’ s family home in Vladivostok has been made into a museum . Arsenyev , a town located in Primorsky Krai , was named after him . In 2018 Vladivostok International airport was renamed after him .

 = Charles Sch C3 A4ffer =   
Charles Schäffer ( February 4 , 1838 – November 23 , 1903 ) was an American physician and botanist from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . His father , Charles Schäffer , was a wholesale druggist and his mother was Priscilla Morgan , daughter of Stacey K. Potts , an old Philadelphia merchant . His early education was received from a private tutor , who prepared him for the University of Pennsylvania where he graduated in medicine in 1859 . He served in the Chester Military Hospital in 1863 and was attending physician at the Mission Hospital and Dispensary from 1874 until its close in 1880 . He became interested in the flora of Philadelphia and vicinity and later extended his collecting trips to the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia amassing a collection of photographs and plants of that region . In 1890 Schäffer married Mary Townsend Sharples , who was his companion on his explorations and was deeply interested in his scientific work . Under his guidance she reproduced the rarer plants in watercolor and photography ; these were published after Schäffer 's death , the illustrations being Mrs. Schäffer 's and the letter-press that of the botanist Stewardson Brown under the title Alpine Flora of the Canadian Rocky Mountains ( 1907 ) , published by G. P. Putnam 's Sons , New York . Schäffer was a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia , and of the Geological Society of America , and was a member of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences , the Historical Society of Pennsylvania , the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society .

 = Betty Eisner =   
Betty Grover Eisner ( September 29 , 1915 – July 1 , 2004 ) was an American psychologist known for pioneering the use of LSD and other psychedelic drugs as adjuncts to psychotherapy .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 Eisner grew up in Kansas City , Missouri , where she graduated from the Sunset Hill School in 1933 . She earned her undergraduate degree in political science from Stanford University in 1937 . During World War II , she served as a Red Cross volunteer . After the war , she traveled across Europe , an experience she documented in a series of letters to the Los Angeles Times . After returning to the U.S. , she earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California , Los Angeles .   
    
    
 == Professional life ==   
 Eisner conducted psychotherapy research , first with Sidney Cohen at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital Veterans Administration Center in Los Angeles and , later , from her private practice in Los Angeles . Eisner authored a book , `` The Unused Potential of Marriage and Sex '' , which was published in 1970 . She also helped found The School for Learning , which taught English in Mexico . In the 1990s , she maintained a private practice in Santa Monica , California , occasionally publishing articles on psychotherapy and serving on the board of advisors for the Albert Hofmann Foundation . In 2002 , Eisner wrote an unpublished autobiographical account of her career entitled `` Remembrances of LSD Therapy Past '' .   
    
    
 == LSD research ==   
 Eisner 's accomplishments are considerable , even if one does not consider how few independent women scientists there were in the 1950s and 1960s . She conducted early research into the use of LSD to treat alcoholism and maintained an active interest in hallucinogens throughout her career . Along with Sidney Cohen , Eisner appears to have originated the practice of using simultaneous male and female therapists or researchers during human hallucinogen administration . Eisner was a therapist for Bill Wilson , co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous , when he tried LSD . In addition to using hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline in psychedelic therapy , Eisner also gave stimulants such as methylphenidate and the inhaled gas mixture carbogen to her patients .   
 However , Eisner 's interest in finding new tools for psychotherapy was not limited to drugs . Eisner was particularly focused on extra-pharmacological variables that she felt influenced outcome of psychotherapeutic sessions . She considered the specific individuals present as an important variable in therapeutic outcome and sometimes conducted sessions in group settings . Some of these group sessions included `` encounter group '' -style expression and body work . Eisner also described the psychotherapeutic importance of a variable she called 'matrix . ' This term encompassed the everyday living space and larger social context in which the patient lived and returned to between sessions.Betty Eisner 's publications and personal correspondence are archived at Stanford University .

 = Calvin Mooers =   
Calvin Northrup Mooers ( October 24 , 1919 – December 1 , 1994 ) , was an American computer scientist known for his work in information retrieval and for the programming language TRAC .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Mooers was a native of Minneapolis , Minnesota , attended the University of Minnesota , and received a bachelor 's degree in mathematics in 1941 . He worked at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory from 1941 to 1946 , and then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where he earned a master 's degree in mathematics and physics . At M.I.T . he developed a mechanical system using superimposed codes of descriptors for information retrieval called Zatocoding . He founded the Zator Company in 1947 to market this idea , and pursued work in information theory , information retrieval , and artificial intelligence .   
 He coined the term `` information retrieval '' using it first in a conference paper presented in March 1950 . See also a short paper published later that year from Mooers .   
    
    
 == Mooers 's law ==   
 He coined `` Mooers 's law '' ( not to be confused with Moore 's law ) and its corollary in 1959 :   
    
 An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it .   
 Where an information retrieval system tends not to be used , a more capable information retrieval system may tend to be used even less .   
    
    
 == TRAC ==   
 He founded the Rockford Research Institute in 1961 , where he developed the TRAC programming language , and attempted to control its distribution and development using trademark law and a unique invocation of   
 copyright . ( At the time patent law would not allow him to control what he saw as his intellectual property and profit from it . ) The trademark strategy was later used by Ada .   
    
    
 == Awards ==   
 Mooers received the American Society for Information Science 's Award of Merit in 1978 . The citation reads in part :   
    
 He was a participant in early developmental work on digital computers , a researcher , author , and implementer of applications in information retrieval ; and a prophet in the 1950s describing the future importance of what is now called computer networks and distributive processing , and daring to predict that machines could simulate thought processes in retrieving computerized information . In 1947 , he proposed the Zator , an electronic , film-scanning retrieval machine , and made the first proposal to use the Boolean operations or , and , and not to prescribe selections in retrieval machines . He developed his own Zatocoding System in 1948 using superimposed subject codes on edge-notched cards . He coined the term `` Information Retrieval '' in 1950 , and went on from there to obtain several patents in information retrieval and signaling , produce a text-handling language ( TRAC ) , author some 200 publications , and form one of the first companies whose only concern was information . His thinking has affected all who are in the field of Information and his early ideas are now incorporated into today 's reality .   
    
    
 == Death ==   
 Mooers died in 1994 in Cambridge , Massachusetts . Mooers 's article critical of John Vincent Atanasoff and his brief tenure as chief of a failed computer construction project at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II , was published posthumously in the May–June 2001 issue of IEEE Annals of the History of Computing .

 George Wall , was born on 22 December 1820 in North Shields , Northumberland , England , the second son of George Wall ( 1773–1852 ) , a Methodist Minister , and Ann née Leetham . Wall began his career in the engineering firm of Sir Joseph Whitworth . Suffering ill health , in September 1846 he moved to Ceylon to take advantage of the climate , and was made acting manager of the Ceylon Plantation Company in Kandy . He remained with the company until 1854 , when he established his own business , George Wall and Company , Coffee Merchants and Estate Agents.Wall opened an office in Colombo and the business soon grew into an important concern , with Wall rising to prominence , accordingly . He became the first Englishman to chair the Planters ' Association of Ceylon ( 1856–1857 ) and was re-elected Chairman nine times . From 1858 Wall sat on the Legislative Council of Ceylon as an unofficial member , supporting the case against the Paddy Tax . On 15 November 1864 , Wall along with James De Alwis , Charles Lorenz , W. Thompson , John Capper and John Eaton resigned from the Council on a point of principle regarding the fiscal policy of the Government and its strict disregard to respect the procedures of the Legislative Council.Wall returned to England in 1859 and spent the next four years in Manchester , where he served as a partner with his former employer , Sir Joseph Whitworth & Co. , enjoying success in small arms manufacturing . Upon his return to Ceylon , he was elected chair of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 1866.He was made a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in February 1872 and the Linnean Society of London . Wall 's business eventually suspended operations in August 1879 following a devastating outbreak of coffee blight . George Wall and Company was subsequently taken over by Bosanquet and Company.Alongside his business activities , George Wall was a keen botanist and amateur astronomer . He was especially interested in ferns and built up a significant herbarium of plants from Ceylon . In 1889 he became the editor of the Ceylon Independent newspaper , a position he retained for six years . In 1892 Wall received the Gold Medal from the Cobden Club for his efforts in abolishing the Ceylon Grain tax . After falling ill in 1894 he returned to England for treatment at St. Thomas ' Hospital , where he died in December that year . He was married twice ( Alice née Makinson ( 1822–1854 ) , the cousin of Edward Watkin and Mary Anne née Dixon , and had thirteen children . One of his sons , Arnold Wall ( 1869–1966 ) , went on to become a professor of botany in New Zealand and another , Frank Wall , also became a naturalist . He died on 18 December 1894.Wall Street in Kotahena , Sri Lanka , is named in honour of George Wall . A Hindu-Saracenic fountain at the Lipton Circus junction in Cinnamon Gardens , Colombo was erected in memory of Wall.The standard author abbreviation G.Wall is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

 = Thomas Allan =   
Thomas Allan of Lauriston FRS FRSE FSA FLS ( 17 July 1777 – 12 September 1833 ) was a British mineralogist .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Allan was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , on 17 July 1777 , the son of Robert Allan ( 1748–1818 ) , a banker . He was educated at the High School of Edinburgh and took up banking as profession ; but he is remembered today for his contributions to mineral science .   
 At an early age Allan became fascinated with minerals and he began to accumulate a large mineral collection that was subsequently bequeathed to his son Robert Allan FRSE . This collection was later incorporated into Robert Greg 's , which was ultimately acquired by the British Museum of Natural History in the mid-nineteenth century .   
 In 1813 , Allan was influential in securing a mineralogy post in the Dublin Philosophical Society for the German mineralogist Karl Ludwig Giesecke ( 1761–1833 ) . Allan was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1805 , his proposers being Sir James Hall , William Wright and John Playfair . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1815 . He served as Curator to the RSE 1812–20 and Treasurer 1821–33.In 1810 , his contribution to mineralogy was acknowledged with a new mineral species from Greenland , being named `` Allanite '' in his honour by Thomas Thomson .   
 His Edinburgh address in later life was 11 Royal Exchange.Allan died at Linden Hall at Morpeth , Northumberland , England , on 12 September 1833 . He is buried in St Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh . His son , Robert Allan ( 1806–1863 ) was also a mineralogist .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Allan contributed the `` Diamond '' article for the fifth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica as well as the work on mineralogical nomenclature An Alphabetical List of the Names of Minerals , at Present Most Familiar in the English , French , and German Languages , with Tables of Analyses ( Edinburgh , 1805 , followed by enlarged editions in 1808 , 1814 , and 1819 ) .

Maurice Marie Alfred Couette ( 9 January 1858 , Tours – 18 August 1943 , Angers ) was a French physicist known for his studies of fluidity .   
 Couette is best known for his contributions to rheology and the theory of fluid flow . He designed a concentric cylinder viscometer that he used to accurately measure the viscosity of fluids . The laminar flow observed in the gap between the two cylinders is known as Couette flow . He studied the boundary conditions of a fluid and showed that the `` no slip '' condition was satisfied for the fluids and wall materials tested .   
    
    
 == Early life and Career ==   
 Couette was born in Tours , France , as the only child of Alfred Ernest Couette , a cloth merchant .   
 Finishing his education with the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes he obtained a baccalauréat in humanities and in science , both in 1874 , as well as bachelor 's degrees in mathematics and physical science ( delivered by the Faculté de Science in Poitiers ) in 1877 and 1879 respectively . Following a short spell as a lecturer in Angers , he joined the 12th Artillery Regiment at Vincennes for one year of voluntary military service .   
 In 1881 he settled in Paris and enrolled in the Sorbonne , studying physical science in preparation for the agrégation , a French teaching diploma . Couette later taught in Arcueil and the École Sainte-Geneviève in Paris . At the Sorbonne he studied under Joseph Boussinesq and from 1887 onwards worked at the Physics Research Laboratory under Gabriel Lippmann ( who would later receive the Nobel Prize in Physics ) . Couette also took his doctoral degree on the friction of liquids ( `` Studies on the Friction of Liquids '' , Etude sur le frottement des liquides , Gauthiers-Villars 1890 ) .   
 Soon afterwards he was given a professorship of physics at the Catholic University of Angers ( now known as Université Catholique de l'Ouest ) as well as other teaching commitments such as at the Free Faculty of Science , the School of Agriculture and several secondary schools in Angers .   
 Couette was a member of the French Physics Society and retired in 1933 .   
    
    
 == Accolades ==   
 Since 1993 , the Prix Maurice Couette is awarded by the Groupe français de Rhéologie .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 In 1886 , Maurice Couette married Jeanne Jenny , who gave birth to eight children , five of whom reached adulthood .

 = Thomas Obicini =   
Thomas Obicini of Novara ( Italian : Tomasso Obicini da Novara ; 1585 – 7 November 1632 ) was a Franciscan friar , originally from Novara , Italy . As an early orientalist , Arabist and linguist , he translated Arabic texts into Latin and took possession of the Grotto of Nazareth for the Franciscan order in 1620 .   
    
    
 == Journey to Nazareth ==   
 In 1620 Fra Obicini 's travelled to Jerusalem to the Emir of Beirut , Fakhr ad-Din II .   
 The background to this mission began seven years earlier , in 1613 , when Fakhr ad-Din II had taken refuge in Tuscany , Italy . The emir formed an alliance with the Medici ruler , Cosimo II , and spent two years under his protection . He spent three more in Sicily and Naples seeking , and failing , to rally a Crusade against Ottoman rule . By 1618 the changed political situation permitted his return to Lebanon .   
 Two years later Friar Obicini journeyed to Jerusalem in an embassy with Lord Battista Tarquet , the Consul of all Palestine , sent by the consul of Sidon , the Christian King , Lord Albert Gardana and the Prosecutor of the Holy Land , Lord Francis Lebar .   
 In Beirut , Obicini was , according to his account , warmly and lavishly received by the emir ad-Din , who had readily granted the two Christian holy sites , the Grotto of the Annunciation , i.e . the Grotto of Nazareth , and Mount Tabor to his Franciscan order .   
 In his description of the acquisition of the holy sites he recounts how he travelling to Nazareth , as a small group of a priest , friar John of Vendôme , and a Sicilian friar , Francesco Salice , had brought letters from the Princes , various testimonials , and a decree from the Qadi of Safed . On Saturday 29 November 1620 , the group took possession of the sanctuary built on the foundations of the House of Loreto and known as the Holy Grotto - the site venerated by Christians as the place where the Angel Gabriel announced the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary.While Obicini was abbot in the convent of Aleppo , Syria he had mastered Syriac , Arabic , Hebrew , Aramaic , and Coptic languages . In 1621 , he was the first lector in Arabic in the San Pietro in Montorio convent and was a precursor of Athanasius Kircher .   
 In 1631 Obicini published Grammatica Arabica ; a Latin translation of the 13th-14th century Arabic grammar Matn Al Ajrumiyyah , ( إلاجرُومِية ) , by Abū Abdullaahi Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Dāwūd aṣ-Ṣanhaajī , known as Ibn Adjurrum .   
 In 1636 Obicini published Thesaurus Arabico-Syro-Latinus , his opus magnum ; a Latin expanded translation of Elijah of Nisibis 's 11th-century glossary intended to assist Latin-speaking prelates in converting Syrians and other Arabic speakers .

 = George Cassander =   
George Cassander ( or Cassant ) ( 1513 – 3 February 1566 ) was a Flemish theologian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Born at Pittem near Bruges , he went at an early age to Leuven . He was teaching theology and literature in 1541 at Bruges and shortly afterwards at Ghent . About 1549 he moved to Cologne , where , after a profound study of the points of difference between the Catholic and reformed churches , he devoted himself to the project of reunion , thus anticipating the efforts of Gottfried Leibniz . He died at Cologne on 3 February 1566 . The collected edition of his works was published in 1616 at Paris .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 In 1561 he published anonymously De officio pii ac publicae tranquillitatis vere amantis viri in hoc religionis dissidio ( Basel ) , in which , while holding that no one , on account of abuses , has a right utterly to subvert the Church , he does not disguise his dislike of those who exaggerated the papal claims . He takes his standpoint on Scripture explained by tradition and the fathers of the first six centuries .   
 At a time when controversy drowned the voice of reason , such a book pleased neither party ; but as some of the German princes thought that he could heal the breach , the emperor Ferdinand asked him to publish his Consultatio de Articulis Fidei lute , Catholicos et Protestantes Controversis ( 1565 ) , in which , like Newman at a later date , he tried to put a Catholic interpretation upon Protestant formularies .   
 While never attacking dogma , and even favouring the Roman church on the ground of authority , he criticizes the papal power and makes reflections on practices . The work , attacked violently by the Leuven theologians on one side , and by Calvin and Beza on the other , was put on the Roman Index in 1617 .

 = Paul Rolland =   
Paul Rolland , né Pali Reisman ( November 21 , 1911 , Budapest – November 9 , 1978 , Illinois ) , was a violist and an influential American violin teacher who concentrated on the pedagogy of teaching fundamentals to beginning string students . He was famous for emphasizing that the physical demands of most violin techniques can be taught ( `` in embryonic form '' ) in the first two years of violin education . He advocated that teachers learn and teach freedom of movement and use clear , specific and concise instructions when teaching . His approach to pedagogy was extremely analytical , and his teaching approach was highly systematic and logical . His wife said of his work `` Every possible movement in string playing was analyzed ... . Different methods do indeed exist , but none more fundamental ... . Paul never harmed anyone 's playing . He helped a person through certain body movements and the knowledge of what those body movements meant physically , in the scientific way of playing the violin . `` [ Cite ]   
    
    
 == Education and performing career ==   
 Paul Rolland earned a Bachelor of Music degree from Simpson College , Indianola , Iowa and a Master of Music degree from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest , Hungary . He was the first violist of the Budapest Symphony , and later played viola in the Pro Ideale and Lener String Quartets . When faced with the decision between continuing to perform and developing his teaching approach , he chose teaching .   
    
    
 == Publications ==   
 Rolland advocated teaching in classes ( masterclass style ) , and made his own teachings and insights available in a set of videos and a book titled The Teaching of Action in String Playing . His ideas and methods were also documented in the University of Illinois String Research Project films . He helped to found the American String Teachers Association , and in 1950 became the first editor of its journal American String Teacher . He also published numerous articles on string pedagogy in the International Musician , The School Musician , Violins , The Instrumentalist , and the Journal of Research in Music Education .   
 He also published a large number of books on string pedagogy .

 = Phyllis Nicolson =   
Phyllis Nicolson ( 21 September 1917 – 6 October 1968 ) was a British mathematician most known for her work on the Crank–Nicolson method together with John Crank .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Nicolson was born Phyllis Lockett in Macclesfield and went to Stockport High School for Girls . She graduated from Manchester University with a B.Sc . in 1938 , M.Sc . in 1939 and a Ph.D. in Physics in 1946 . She was a research student in Cambridge from 1945 and a Tucker-Price Research Fellow of Girton College , Cambridge from 1946 to 1949 . She married Malcolm Nicolson , also a physicist , in 1942 and had two sons . The family moved to Leeds where Malcolm Nicolson was appointed to a lectureship in Physics at Leeds University . Malcolm Nicolson died accidentally in 1951 , and Phyllis was appointed to take over his lectureship . In 1955 , she married physicist Malcolm McCaig by whom she had another son . She died from breast cancer in 1968 in Sheffield .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 During her time in Manchester , Nicolson worked with Douglas Hartree and became a proficient numerical analyst and an expert user of Hartree 's differential analyser . Nicolson initially worked on cosmic ray problems , but after the outbreak of war Hartree 's differential analyser group pursued defence-related problems . Two of the problems in her thesis are derived from work done for the Ministry of Supply . One of these problems was on solutions of the heat equation , and with her colleague John Crank she investigated the numerical stability of several solution techniques . The algorithm now known as the Crank–Nicolson method emerged from this work and was published in 1947 .

Wheelton Hind ( 1860–1920 ) was an English surgeon and geologist .   
    
    
 == Education and career ==   
 Wheelton Hind studied medicine at Guy 's Hospital Medical School . He qualified MRCS in 1882 . He graduated MB BS Lond in 1883 . He was a house surgeon and resident obstetric physician at Guy 's Hospital . He received his medical research MD in 1884 .   
 At the London University he won the Gold Medal and Scholarship in organic chemistry and gained 1st class honours in physiology . He then settled in practice at Stoke-on-Trent , was Surgeon to the North Stafford Infirmary and Eye Institution , Consulting Medical Officer to the Union Infirmary , Medical Officer to the North Stafford Deaf and Blind School , and Surgeon to the North Stafford Railway .   
 Throughout his medical practice his chief recreation was field work in geology . Following Charles Lapworth 's pioneering method of studying index fossils , Hind applied the method to the stratigraphy of Carboniferous rocks in Suffolk .   
 His success in discovering the regular order in which the different assemblages of fossils occurred in Staffordshire and Derbyshire gradually led him further afield . He co-operated with members of the Geological Survey , and after extended researches in Lancashire and Yorkshire he joined Mr. J. Allen Howe in 1901 in contributing to the Geological Society of London a fundamentally important memoir on the classification of the Lower Carboniferous rocks of north-central England .   
 Wheelton Hind published numerous articles in the Transactions of the North Staffordshire Naturalists ' Field Club . His monograph On the Lamellibranch and Gasteropod Fauna found in the Millstone Grit of Scotland was a revision of the stratigraphy of Carboniferous Mollusca and won him the honour of the Keith Medal .   
 In 1914 he rapidly recruited men to form a battery of Garrison Artillery , and led them to the Western Front . The battery fought in some important engagements . He was soon transferred as Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel RAMC and returned to England at the end of WWI .

Charles Fox Burney ( 4 November 1868 – 15 April 1925 ) was biblical scholar at Oxford University , England .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Charles was the son of Charles Burney , Paymaster Chief Royal Navy , and his wife Eleanor Norton , daughter of the Rev . W. A. Norton , rector of Alderton and Eye , Suffolk . He was educated at Merchant Taylors ' School , and St John 's College , Oxford .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
    
 In 1893 Burney was elected Senior Scholar of St John 's and lecturer in Hebrew . He became a Fellow of St John 's in 1899 and Vice President in 1900 , 1906 , 1910 and 1911 . In June 1914 , Dr Burney became the Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture , and was additionally elected a Fellow of Oriel College , Oxford in 1919 .   
 Burney published several works on biblical history . In Israel 's settlement in Canaan , he brought much new or newly applied material , especially from Babylonian sources , to explain Israel 's early residence in Canaan . A major contribution was the theory that Yahweh ( Jehovah ) was at an early period an Amorite deity . In The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel he attempted to prove that St John 's Gospel was a literal Greek translation of a Gospel written in Aramaic by a Jewish disciple , and this at least led to an accepted view that the author thought in Aramaic , and strengthened the probability that it was the work of an eyewitness .   
    
    
 == Family ==   
 In 1913 at the age of 45 he married Ethel Wordsworth Madan ( 1891–1984 ) , the elder daughter of Falconer Madan and his wife Frances Hayter . In 1929 Ethel Burney started work for Rosalind Moss at the Griffith Institute at Oxford . Together Moss and Burney continued the work that had been started by Bertha Porter ( with Moss as her assistant ) in the early 1920s on the Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts , Reliefs , and Paintings . 'The Two Ladies ' as they were known travelled throughout the Middle East and the rest of the world until the late 1960s visiting digs , museums and collections , and gathering data for the many volumes of the Topographical Bibliography that they produced together with a small team of collaborators.Charles and Ethel 's daughter , Venetia Phair , is famed for proposing the name Pluto for the erstwhile planet , at the age of 11 .

 He was Director of the Vienna Natural History Museum .   
 Holdhaus worked on the Coleoptera of glacial refugia , postglacial range expansions and “ Massifs de Refugium ” . He recognised that the distribution of blind euedaphic and troglobitic beetles is restricted to a well definable area in Europe , south of a line connecting Bordeaux , Lyon , the southern Alps , the Carpathians and the Black Sea . This is the “ Holdhaus line ” - the northern distribution limit of beetles with very poor powers of dispersal , especially blind cave beetles . Only two small areas with blind beetles are known north of this line the Jura and the Northeastern Alps ) .Also South of this line there are many endemic animal and These areas are the “ Massifs de Refugium ” of Chodat & Pampanini ( 1902 ) .

Aurelio Bacciarini ( 8 November 1873 – 27 June 1935 ) was a Swiss Roman Catholic who served as the interim administrator of the Diocese of Lugano . He was a professed member of the Servants of Charity - also known as the Guanellians - and was also the founder of the Secular Institute of the Company of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus . He became known in his diocese as the `` Apostle of the Sacred Heart '' .   
 He was proclaimed to be Venerable in 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI recognized that he had lived a life of heroic virtue . A miracle attributed to his intercession required for his beatification is now under investigation .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Aurelio Bacciarini was born in Ticino in Switzerland on 8 November 1873 to Lodovico and Maria Sciarini as the seventh of eight children ; one older sister was Filomena . He was baptized on 9 November under the Provost Father Pietro Vaghetti with the names of `` Stefano Aurelio '' . The eighth child - a sister - died in 1875 soon after birth and his father died on 6 September 1876.He went to Vaghetti for support in following his vocation and he soon commenced his theological studies in Milan . He was ordained to the priesthood on 12 June 1897 in Rome in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli . He served as a spiritual director from 1903 to 1906 . On 8 October 1906 in Como he entered Luigi Guanella 's order and ascended to the post of its Superior General in 1915 . The beginning of 1917 saw Pope Benedict XV appoint him as the Apostolic Administrator of Lugano and he received his episcopal consecration a week later in Rome under Cardinal Basilio Pompili . He was also consecrated as the Titular Bishop of Daulia . Bacciarini was committed to the reorganization of Catholic Action as well as the promotion of crucifixes in public spaces.His program for his diocese was thus :   
    
 Renew religious life in families   
 Educate children in the faithBacciarini established several diocesan institutions that included a newspaper - `` Giornale del Popolo '' - in 1926 and his own religious congregation at the same time . He was described as the `` Apostle of the Sacred Heart '' .   
 Bacciarini died on 27 June 1935 at 4:45pm in Lugano . He was buried in the Shrine of the Sacred Heart .   
    
    
 == Beatification process ==   
 The beatification process commenced in Lugano in 1946 under Pope Pius XII in a process that spanned until 25 March 1964 . This occurred despite the fact that the formal introduction of the cause was not until 15 December 1981 under Pope John Paul II ; it was this introduction that conferred upon him the posthumous title Servant of God . The local process was ratified in 1982 and culminated with the creation of the Positio . It was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1997 for further evaluation .   
 On 15 March 2008 he was declared to be Venerable after Pope Benedict XVI recognized that Bacciarini had lived a life of heroic virtue .   
 The miracle needed for his beatification was investigated and the process received the formal decree of ratification in 2007 .

 = Jakob Amsler-Laffon =   
Jakob Amsler-Laffon ( 11 November 1823 – 3 January 1912 ) was a mathematician , physicist , engineer and the founder of his own factory . Amsler was born on the Stalden near the village of Schinznach in the district of Brugg , canton Aargau , and died in Schaffhausen , Switzerland . His father was Jakob Amsler-Amsler ( 1779–1869 ) .   
 On graduating from school in 1843 , he went to the University of Jena and then to the University of Königsberg to study theology . At Königsberg he changed courses , deciding to focus on mathematics and physics after meeting the inspiring Franz Neumann . Among Amsler 's fellow students at Königsberg were Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold . Amsler gained his doctorate from Königsberg in 1848 and returned to Switzerland in the same year . In 1851 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Zürich and later in that year accepted a position as a mathematics teacher at the Gymnasium in Schaffhausen . In 1854 Amsler married Elise Laffon ( 1830–1899 ) . The couple had two daughters and three sons . Their oldest son Alfred Amsler ( 1857–1940 ) was a mathematician and engineer in his own right and succeeded to his father as the owner and director of the factory . From about 1885 until about 1905 , father and son closely cooperated on many projects in their business ; many of their ideas , inventions and constructions of the time are difficult to attribute to either one of them .   
 Jakob Amsler-Laffon invented the polar planimeter in 1854 .

 = Fran C3 A7ois-Napol C3 A9on-Marie Moigno =   
Abbé François-Napoléon-Marie Moigno ( French : [ mwaɲo ] ; 15 April 1804 – 14 July 1884 ) was a French Catholic priest and one time Jesuit , as well as a physicist and author . He considered himself a student of Cauchy .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Moigno was born at Guémené-sur-Scorff , Morbihan , in Brittany , on 15 April 1804 . He received his early education at the Jesuit college at Sainte-Anne-d'Auray and entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus on 2 September 1822 . He did his theological studies at Montrouge , devoting his leisure to mathematics and physics .   
 On the outbreak of the Revolution of 1830 , he left with his fellow Jesuits for Brieg in Switzerland . There he acquired several languages , including Hebrew and Arabic . In 1836 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the College of Sainte-Geneviève , Rue des Postes , in Paris . Here he became known not only as a scholar , but also as a preacher and writer . He wrote numerous articles for the press ; he was engaged on one of his best known works , `` Leçons de calcul différentiel et de calcul intégral '' , based chiefly on Cauchy 's methods , and had already published the first volume , when he left the Jesuit Order in 1843 .   
 Shortly afterwards he undertook a tour of Europe , contributing numerous letters to the journal `` L'Epoque '' . He acted as chaplain of the Lycée Louis-le-Grand from 1848 to 1851 . He became scientific editor of the `` Presse '' in 1850 and of the `` Pays '' in 1851 and in 1852 founded the scientific journal `` Cosmos '' . In 1862 he founded `` Les Mondes '' and became associated with the clergy of Saint-Germain-des-Prés . In 1873 he was appointed a canon of the collegiate chapter of the Basilica of Saint-Denis . He died there on 14 July 1884 .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 Moigno was a prolific writer , an expositor of science rather than an original investigator . He also translated numerous English and Italian memoirs on science into French , and edited the `` Actualités scientifiques '' .   
 Among his works are :   
    
 `` Répertoire d'optique moderne '' ( Paris , 1847–50 ) ;   
 `` Traité de télégraphie électrique '' ( Paris , 1849 ) ;   
 `` Leçons de mécanique analytique '' ( Paris , 1868 ) ;   
 `` Saccharimétrie '' ( Paris , 1869 ) ;   
 `` Optique moléculaire '' ( Paris , 1873 ) ;   
 `` Les splendeurs de la foi '' ( Paris , 1879–83 ) ;   
 `` Les livres saints et la science '' ( Paris , 1884 ) , etc. , and numerous articles in the `` Comptes Rendus '' , `` Revue Scientifique '' , `` Cosmos '' , etc .

In 1911 he joined the Health Military Corporation , in which he was given the military rank of tinent coronel farmacèutic . He was on a botanic expedition in Albarracín ( Aragon ) with his fellowship when the Francisco Franco 's 1936 coup d'état failed and began the Spanish Civil War . When he want back to Barcelona , he had to go through the war front ; for this the reason he was accused of being a member of the military rebellion and lost all his honours , which made continuation of his scientific work difficult.He was president of the Institució Catalana d'Història Natural ( 1931–1934 ) , president of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans in 1958 and of the Société Botanique at Geneve , honour vice president of the International Botany Congresses at Paris ( 1954 ) and Edinburgh ( 1964 ) and doctor honoris causa at the University of Montpellier .   
 Pius Font i Quer was the main creator of scientific botanical terminology in Catalan and Spanish . His most well-known works are : Diccionario de Botánica ( 1953 ) , which is the reference work for botany students in Spain ; Plantas medicinales ( 1961 ) ; and Botánica pintoresca ( 1958 ) . His research took place in Spain , but specially in Catalonia , southern Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands , mainly in Ibiza and Formentera .

 = James L. Tuck =   
James Leslie Tuck OBE , ( 9 January 1910 – 15 December 1980 ) was a British physicist . He was born in Manchester , England , and educated at the Victoria University of Manchester . Because of his involvement with the Manhattan Project , he was unable to submit his thesis on time and never received his doctoral degree .   
 In 1937 he was offered an appointment as a Salter Research Fellow at Oxford University , where he worked with Leó Szilárd on particle accelerators .   
 At the outbreak of World War II , he was appointed as the scientific advisor to Frederick Alexander Lindemann , who was on the private staff of Winston Churchill . His research included work on shaped charges , used in anti-tank weapons . For this work he received the Order of the British Empire from King George VI .   
    
    
 == Bomb work ==   
 His expertise on shaped charges led to his being sent to Los Alamos , where he was a member of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project and helped in the development of explosive lensing and the Urchin initiator [ 1 ] . This work was crucial to the success of the plutonium atomic bomb .   
 After the war , he returned briefly to England , where he worked at the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University . However , he found the postwar conditions there difficult and in 1949 returned to the United States , assuming a position at the University of Chicago . A year later , he returned to Los Alamos when he was invited to work on thermonuclear research .   
    
    
 == Fusion power ==   
 At Los Alamos , Tuck took up research on fusion power , which he had learned about in the UK . Tuck suggested that the Los Alamos group pursue a pinch program similar to the one being carried out in the UK . This was only months after Lyman Spitzer had started work on his stellarator design . Both were invited to Washington to present their ideas , where Spitzer won $ 50,000 in funding from the Atomic Energy Commission . Returning to Los Alamos , he arranged for a similar $ 50,000 from the lab 's discretionary budget and started a pinch project under the name Perhapsatron .   
 Like all pinch systems , Perhapsatron failed due to instabilities in the plasma . Theoretical work by Edward Teller and others suggested ways out of the instability problem , either pinching so quickly that fusion took place before the instabilities formed , or by using `` cusped '' magnetic fields . The former was developed as the Columbus while the latter became the picket fence reactor design , both led by Tuck 's teams .   
 He remained at Los Alamos until his retirement in 1972 . Earlier in 1972 he had published a review in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists of the book Beyond the Ivory Tower : The Frontiers of Public and Private Science by Solly Zuckerman .   
 After his retirement Tuck became a prominent public supporter of research into thermonuclear fusion for power generation . He also became interested in the phenomenon of ball lightning , probably because of the connection between plasmas and their role in fusion power schemes , and in 1980 he appeared in the Arthur C. Clarke 's Mysterious World episode 'Clarke 's Cabinet of Curiosities ' where he described his experiments at Los Alamos , carried out during lunch breaks , to create ball lightning using a large storage battery of the type then used in submarines .

He obtained his PhD in 1972 , from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology , with a thesis entitled `` Entropy perturbations in cosmology '' . He is best known for his 1981 paper   
 on the origin of cosmological density perturbations from quantum fluctuations , coauthored with Viatcheslav Mukhanov . This is the earliest of a number of calculations addressing the origin of density fluctuations in inflationary cosmology , which is the most common hypothesis for the origin of the expanding universe and the structure within it .

 = Dilworth Wayne Woolley =   
Dilworth Wayne Woolley ( July 20 , 1914 – July 23 , 1966 ) was a Canadian-born American biochemist , who did important work on vitamin deficiency , and was one of the first to study the role of serotonin in brain chemistry . He was nominated for a Nobel Prize in 1939 , 1948 , 1949 , and 1950 .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 Wayne Woolley was born in Raymond , Alberta , the son of Americans living in Canada . His extended family were prominent members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ; his great-grandfather was Edwin Dilworth Woolley , a Mormon bishop in Utah.Wayne Woolley ( as he was known ) was a precocious child who finished high school at age 13 , and completed an undergraduate degree in chemistry at the University of Alberta at age 19 . He pursued graduate studies in the department of agricultural chemistry at the University of Wisconsin , where he earned his PhD in 1939 . His graduate research with Conrad Elvehjem concerned nicotinic acid as a treatment for canine blacktongue , with implications for human pellagra .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Woolley spent much of his career at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City . His major work focused on serotonin in brain chemistry : how substances such as LSD might affect the action of serotonin , how disorders of serotonin function might be responsible for mental disorders , and how serotonin might play a part in memory and learning . Though his career was shorter-lived than expected , subsequent work by others has developed many of Woolley 's hypotheses in productive directions . One of his assistants , Robert Bruce Merrifield , won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1984 , for work on peptide synthesis they did together in the 1950s.In 1940 and in 1948 , Woolley received Eli Lilly Awards from the American Chemical Society , for his research . In 1952 he was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences . He served as president of the Institute of Nutrition in 1959.Woolley was an author on over 200 research papers and book articles in his thirty-year career . Books by Woolley included A Study of Antimetabolites ( 1952 ) , and The Biochemical Bases of Psychoses ( 1962 ) .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Woolley married bacteriologist Janet Ruth McCarter in 1945 . Woolley had Diabetes mellitus type 1 from childhood , and in 1923 was among the first children to receive insulin to treat the condition . He nonetheless experienced blindness as a complication of his diabetes , and was completely blind from age 25 until his death from a heart attack at age 52 , while hiking in Cuzco , Peru.A small collection of the papers of D. Wayne Woolley are at the Rockefeller University Archive Center .

Alfred Jahn ( April 22 , 1915 , Kleparów , near Lwów ( L'viv ) – April 1 , 1999 , Wrocław ) was a Polish geographer , geomorphologist , polar explorer and rector of Wrocław University .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was born on April 22 , 1915 , in Kleparów , near Lwów ( L'viv ) . He obtained a Masters of Science degree at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów in 1937 . In the same year he took part in the First Polish West Greenland Expedition , organized by Aleksander Kosiba , which provided him with enough material for his PhD dissertation . Completed in 1939 , it had the title `` Investigations on the structure and temperature of soils in West Greenland '' .Jahn survived the Nazi occupation of Poland by working as a feeder of lice at Rudolf Weigl 's typhus research institute in Lwów . After the war he first worked in Lublin , at the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University , and then in the reconstituted Wrocław University ( which included a large number of the faculty from Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów who survived the war ) . In the 1950s he resumed his polar studies , participating in expeditions to Spitsbergen and the Polish Polar Station in Hornsund . He also conducted research in Siberia , Alaska and other parts of Scandinavia which made him one of the foremost polar geomorphologists in the world . He was made president ( rector ) of Wrocław University in 1962 . In 1953 and 1980 Alfred Jahn published various works on the Polish part of the Sudetes Mountains emphasizing the role of climate in shaping the mountains.In 1968 , as a rector of Wrocław University , he made the decision to support the student strikes against Communist censorship . As a result , he lost his job . Likewise , during the martial law in Poland in 1982 , he spoke out against the policies of the Jaruzelski government and was consequently removed by the authorities from his position as chair of the Committee on Polar Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences.In 1972 he founded the Polar Club of the Geographical Society of Poland and served as its first president until 1982 . Jahn retired in the 1990s but remained scholarly active until his death on April 1 , 1999 , in Wrocław.Alfred Jahn was a member of the Polish Academy of Science , of Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters , and the German Akademie Leopoldina . He published his memoirs , `` Z Kleparowa w świat szeroki '' ( From Kleparow into the big wide world ) , in 1991 .

 = John Gill (theologian) =   
John Gill ( 23 November 1697 – 14 October 1771 ) was an English Baptist pastor , biblical scholar , and theologian who held to a firm Calvinistic soteriology . Born in Kettering , Northamptonshire , he attended Kettering Grammar School where he mastered the Latin classics and learned Greek by age 11 . He continued self-study in everything from logic to Hebrew , his love for the latter remaining throughout his life .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 At the age of about 12 , Gill heard a sermon from his pastor , William Wallis , on the text , `` And the LORD God called unto Adam , and said unto him , Where art thou ? '' ( Genesis 3:9 ) . The message stayed with Gill and eventually led to his conversion . It was not until six years later that he made a public profession when he was 18 .   
    
    
 == Pastoral work ==   
 His first pastoral work was as an intern assisting John Davis at Higham Ferrers in 1718 at age 21 . He became pastor at the Strict Baptist church at Goat Yard Chapel , Horsleydown , Southwark in 1719 . His pastorate lasted 51 years . In 1757 his congregation needed larger premises and moved to a Carter Lane , St. Olave ’ s Street , Southwark . This Baptist church was once pastored by Benjamin Keach and would later become the New Park Street Chapel and then the Metropolitan Tabernacle pastored by Charles Spurgeon .   
 During Gill 's ministry , the church strongly supported the preaching of George Whitefield at nearby Kennington Common .   
    
    
 == Various works ==   
 In 1748 , Gill was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Aberdeen . He was a profound scholar and a prolific author . His most important works are :   
    
 The Doctrine of the Trinity Stated and Vindicated ( London , 1731 )   
 The Cause of God and Truth ( 4 parts , 1735–38 ) , a retort to Daniel Whitby 's Five Points   
 An Exposition of the New Testament ( 3 vols. , 1746–48 ) , which with his Exposition of the Old Testament ( 6 vols. , 1748–63 ) forms his magnum opus   
 A Collection of Sermons and Tracts [ 1 ]   
 A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language , Letters , Vowel-Points , and Accents ( 1767 )   
 A Body of Doctrinal Divinity ( 1767 )   
 A Body of Practical Divinity ( 1770 ) .Gill also edited and re-published the works of the antinomian theologian Rev . Tobias Crisp , D.D . ( 1600–1643 ) .   
    
    
 == Significance ==   
 John Gill was the first major writing Baptist theologian , his work retaining influence into the 21st century . Gill 's relationship with hyper-Calvinism in English Baptist life is a matter of debate . Peter Toon has argued that Gill was himself a hyper-Calvinist , which would make Gill the father of Baptist hyper-Calvinism . However , Tom Nettles and Timothy George have argued that Gill was not a hyper-Calvinist . Gill 's works are still highly regarded by Primitive Baptists and related groups .

 = Wolfgang Gaede =   
Wolfgang Max Paul Gaede ( 25 May 1878 – 24 June 1945 ) was a German physicist and pioneer of vacuum engineering .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
 Gaede was born in Lehe , Bremerhaven , the son of Prussian Colonel Karl Gaede and Amalia , nee Renf . In 1897 he began studying medicine at the University of Freiburg , but he soon switched to the field of physics . In 1901 he wrote his doctoral thesis on the change of the specific heat of metals with temperature . Subsequent research on the Volta effect in a vacuum was unsuccessful , as the pump technology of the time could not create sufficient vacuum for the investigations . This prompted Gaede to deal more closely with vacuum technology . He invented the rotating mercury pump for high vacuum , which he presented to his scientific colleagues in 1905 at a congress in Merano . Also in Freiburg im Breisgau , Gaede wrote his habilitation thesis on The external friction of gases in 1909 .   
 In 1913 he received a professorship at the University of Freiburg . In the following six years , he invented the momentum transfer pump ( molecular pump ) and a mercury diffusion pump . In 1919 , Gaede joined the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology as a professor of experimental physics , where he worked in the following research areas :   
    
 Vacuum technology   
 Radio and communications technology   
 Process for obtaining pure hydrogen and mercury   
 Exploration of lightning protection equipment   
 Movement of liquids in a rotating hollow ringIn 1930 , Gaede was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina . In 1933/34 two employees denounced Gaede to the Gestapo , as having called the National Socialists `` childish '' . He then had to retire , although all allegations proved to be false . Despite this incident , the Werner von Siemens Ring for 1933 was given to him in 1934 . He also received various awards at international level in the following years .   
 A lifelong consultancy contract from 1906 with Leybold GmbH of Cologne made it possible for him to continue his research in his private laboratory in Karlsruhe and later in Munich . Among other things , he invented the gas ballast principle . Gaede was the owner of almost 40 patents in Germany , and many others abroad . A call to return to the university in Karlsruhe after the end of the war did not reach Gaede .   
 Gaede died in Munich in 1945 .

Albert Levan ( 8 March 1905 – 28 March 1998 ) was a Swedish botanist and geneticist .   
 Albert Levan is best known today for co-authoring the report in 1956 that humans had forty-six chromosomes ( instead of forty-eight , as previously believed ) . This epochal discovery was made by Joe Hin Tjio in Levan 's laboratory .   
 Originally specialising in plant cytology , Levan later turned to the similarities in the chromosome structure of cancer cells and errors introduced to plant cells via chemical or radioactive elements . These studies later led to examination of chromosomes in animal cells .   
 Levan was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1967 .

Maurice du Martheray died suddenly on 12 April 1955 and is resting in the cemetery of Nyon , his birthplace , on the shore of Lake Leman in Switzerland .   
 During his over 40 years of observations he produced more than 20,000 high resolution pictures of the Sun , and more than 10,000 pictures of the Moon and the planets . After the Swiss Astronomical Society was created in Bern in November 1938 , Maurice du Martheray co-edited the first issue of its magazine , ORION with Max Schürer , Privat Dozent at the University of Bern and later Professor of astronomy and director of the Astronomical Institute of the same University ; with the serious amateur and producer of the almanac Der Sternenhimmel Robert A.

 = Robert Alfred Cloyne Godwin-Austen =   
Robert Alfred Cloyne Godwin-Austen FRS ( 17 March 1808 – 25 November 1884 ) was an English geologist .   
 Godwin-Austen was the eldest son of Sir Henry E. Austen . He was educated at Oriel College , Oxford , of which he became a fellow in 1830 . He afterwards entered Lincoln 's Inn . In 1833 he married the only daughter and heiress of Major General Sir Henry Godwin KCB , and in 1854 he took the additional name of Godwin by Royal licence . At Oxford as a pupil of William Buckland he became deeply interested in geology . Soon afterwards he met and was inspired by Henry De la Beche and assisted him by making a geological map of the neighbourhood of Newton Abbot in Devon , which was embodied in the Geological Survey map . He also published an elaborate memoir On the Geology of the South-East of Devonshire ( Trans . Geol . Soc . ser . 2 , vol . viii . ) .   
 His attention was next directed to the Cretaceous rocks of Surrey , his home county - his estates being situated at Chilworth and Shalford near Guildford . Later he dealt with the superficial deposits bordering the English Channel , and with the erratic boulders of Selsey . In 1855 he brought before the Geological Society of London his paper On the possible Extension of the Coal-Measures beneath the South-Eastern part of England , in which he pointed out on well-considered theoretical grounds the likelihood of coal measures being some day reached in that area . In this article he also advocated the freshwater origin of the Old Red Sandstone , and discussed the relations of that formation , and of the Devonian , to the Silurian and Carboniferous .   
 Godwin Austen was entrusted with the completion of a work intended by the naturalist Edward Forbes , F.R.S . which was entitled Natural History of the European Seas published in 1859.He was elected F.R.S . in 1849 , and in 1862 he was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London , on which occasion he was styled by Roderick Murchison pre-eminently the physical geographer of bygone periods .

Ely Devons ( 29 July 1913 – 28 December 1967 ) , an economist and statistician , was born in Bangor , Gwynedd North Wales , lived most of his life in Manchester and died after a long illness at St Thomas Hospital in London . He was survived by his wife , the concert pianist Estelle Wine , and their three children . His father was a rabbi from Lithuania , while scientist Samuel Devons was his brother .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 As a child Devons ’ family moved throughout Britain and he was schooled at Hanley High School , Portsmouth Grammar School , and North Manchester Grammar School . From 1931 to 1934 , Devons attended the Victoria University of Manchester where he read Economics , Politics and Modern History and would graduate with first class honours . After graduating he received a research fellowship to undertake an MA specialising in Economics and produced a well-received thesis on productivity that was published in The Economic Journal.He worked as an economic assistant in Manchester at the Joint Committee of Cotton Trades Organisations over the period 1935–1939 and was brought into the Ministry of Supply , as a statistician working on Cotton Control , soon after the outbreak of the Second World War . Within a year he was encouraged to join the War Cabinet ’ s Central Economic Intelligence Service ( the precursor to the Economic Section and Central Statistics Office ) by John Jewkes and Harry Campion , two former colleagues from Manchester . Devons began work in Whitehall in March 1940 and joined a tight group of former academics and economists – a group that also included Lionel Robbins , Norman Chester , Alec Cairncross , Evan Durbin , D.G . Champernowne , and Harold Wilson – drafted into the British war effort . Between 1940 and 1945 he became the first Chief Statistician for the Central Statistics Office , then Director of Statistics , and finally the Director General of Planning , Programmes and Statistics with the Ministry of Aircraft Production.After the war , he returned to Manchester as a Reader in Applied Economics and , in 1947 , was appointed the Robert Ottley Professor of Applied Economics ( the first such chair in a British University ) . Despite initial reservations , he remained at Manchester until 1959 and helped to build a dynamic Faculty of Economic and Social Studies working alongside Arthur Lewis , Harry Johnson , Michael Polyani , Max Glukman and Bill Mackenzie . Devons ’ career ended at the London School of Economics ( where he had replaced James Meade as Professor of Commerce ) when illness forced his early retirement in 1965 ; the Ely Devons Prize , for outstanding performance in the MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics programme , is awarded in his honour . Away from Higher Education , he served on the council of the Royal Economic Society ( 1956–1964 ) , the Local Government Commission ( 1959 to 1965 ) and as a sometime Government advisor to the aircraft industry and Monopolies Commission .   
    
    
 == Influence ==   
 Despite being known for his obstinacy , Devons was well liked by his colleagues and well respected by his peers . Though often a critic , he was an able and constructive administrator who held a wide range of research interests . These were disseminated across a range of academic papers , newspaper articles and broadcast talks as well as in a notable survey of his wartime experience . This work has since been overlooked by economists and historians alike , but has recently been rediscovered as both as ‘ a useful source of practical operations management `` know how '' ’ and as an important source to use when considering the complex relationship between economics and politics in Britain during the 1940s and 1950s .

 == Council on Wage and Price Stability ==   
    
 The Council on Wage and Price Stability ( COWPS or CWPS ) Act was signed into law by President Ford in 1974 , with Rees as the new agency 's first head . It replaced the formal price controls from the Nixon administration authorized under its precursor , the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 and its related agency , the Pay Board and Price Commission . The council continued under President Carter ( with Alfred E. Kahn replacing Rees as its head under the new administration ) . When Reagan took office in 1981 , CWPS economists moved to the newly formed Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs . Some labor and economic regulator responsibilities merged back into their historic homes with the National Labor Relations Board and the Council of Economic Advisors .

 = Ferdinand David (musician) =   
Ferdinand Ernst Victor Carl David ( German : [ ˈdaːvɪt ] ; 19 June 1810 – 18 July 1873 ) was a German virtuoso violinist and composer .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in the same house in Hamburg where Felix Mendelssohn had been born the previous year , David was raised Jewish but later converted to Protestant Christianity . David was a pupil of Louis Spohr and Moritz Hauptmann from 1823 to 1824 and in 1826 became a violinist at Königstädtischen Theater in Berlin . In 1829 he was the first violinist of Baron Carl Gotthard von Liphardt 's ( father of Karl Eduard von Liphart ) string quartet in Dorpat and he undertook concert tours in Riga , Saint Petersburg and Moscow . In 1835 he became concertmaster ( Konzertmeister ) at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig working with Mendelssohn . David returned to Dorpat to marry Liphart 's daughter Sophie . In 1843 David became the first professor of violin ( Violinlehrer ) at the newly founded Leipziger Konservatorium für Musik .   
 David worked closely with Mendelssohn , providing technical advice during the preparation of the latter 's Violin Concerto in E minor . He was also the soloist in the premiere of the work in 1845 , and , with Clara Schumann , played the official premiere of Schumann 's first violin sonata in Leipzig in March 1852 .   
 He died suddenly in 1873 , aged 63 , while on a mountain excursion with his children , near Klosters in the Graubünden ( Grisons ) area of Switzerland .   
    
    
 == Compositions ==   
 David 's own compositions number about 50 opuses . They include 12 `` theme and variations '' pieces for violin and Orchestra , five violin concertos , a string sextet , `` Concertinos '' for Violin , Bassoon , Clarinet & Trombone and Orchestra , and a number of Lieder . Supposedly he also wrote two symphonies and an opera ( Hans Wacht , 1852 ) . Unfortunately , these have not been verified to have been preserved .   
 David 's most played piece today is without a doubt his Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra ( Op.4 ) . This piece is very often used as the obligatory piece for trombonists auditioning for symphony orchestras around the world .   
    
    
 == Editions and arrangements ==   
 David had close connections with Breitkopf & Härtel and other publishers in Leipzig , and also worked as editor of violin works including those of Francesco Maria Veracini , Pietro Locatelli and Johann Gottlieb Goldberg . He was editor of the complete Beethoven piano trios for C.F . Peters Edition . He was also editor of the set of J.S . Bach 's Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin in 1843 .   
 He made an arrangement for violin and piano of Niccolò Paganini 's 24 Caprices for Solo Violin , which was the version used for the world premiere integral recording of the Caprices , by Ossy Renardy and Walter Robert in 1940 , the centenary of Paganini 's death ; this was seven years before Ruggiero Ricci made the first recording of the original solo violin version.The Chaconne in G minor attributed to Tomaso Antonio Vitali was published for the first time from a manuscript in the Sächsische Landesbibliothek in Dresden in David 's well renowned violin-method Die Hohe Schule des Violinspiels ( 1867 ) .   
 He also wrote an often used version of the cadenza for Beethoven 's violin-concerto , used by 12-year old Joseph Joachim at the revival-concert of this piece in 1844 , under Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy .   
    
    
 == Trivia ==   
 David played on a 1742 Guarneri violin , which later became the main performance violin for Jascha Heifetz . The David Guarneri violin is now in the collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco ; it is on permanent loan to Alexander Barantschik who has showcased it with the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Academy Orchestra.On the recommendation of William Sterndale Bennett , with whom he had worked in Leipzig , David 's son Paul David became the first Director of Music at Uppingham School from 1864–1908 .

Catherine Gage ( 18 May 1815 – 16 February 1892 ) was an Irish botanist , botanical and ornithological illustrator .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
    
 Catherine Gage was born in County Down on 18 May 1815 , the daughter of Rev . Robert Gage and Catherine Boyd . Gage lived her entire life in the family home , Manor House on Rathlin Island . Gage died 16 February 1892 and was buried on Rathlin Island .   
    
    
 == Illustration work ==   
 Gage seems to have devoted a large portion of her life to illustrating a book by her brother Robert Gage on the birds of Rathlin Island that was never published . The book was styled on that of John James Audubon 's The Birds of America . During the course of this work she produced over five hundred watercolours of birds . She also illustrated local plants , creating a list for the Botanical Society of Edinburgh , the abstract for which was published in the 1850 Annals and Magazine of Natural History . She also worked with her sister , Barbara Gage , illustrating the local flora as well as the fauna.When the folio of bird illustrations was auctioned in 2010 , they were sold for €13,500 .

Dr. Frederick Gale Shuman ( July 13 , 1919 – July 29 , 2005 ) was an American pioneer in the development of operational numerical weather prediction . Shuman participated in the major events that brought computer forecasting from academic concepts to the foundation of weather prediction . He began his work in the early 1950s to discover numerical methods that give today 's meteorologists the ability to issue extended weather forecasts and to predict severe weather conditions several days in advance .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Frederick Gale Shuman was born in South Bend , Indiana and graduated from South Bend Central High School in 1937 . His father worked at the Studebaker Motor Company in the design shop .

 = Karl Nikolas Fraas =   
Karl Nikolas Fraas ( 8 September 1810 – 9 November 1875 ) , German botanist and agriculturist , was born at Rattelsdorf , near Bamberg .   
 After receiving his preliminary education at the gymnasium of Bamberg , he in 1830 entered the University of Munich , where he took his doctor 's degree in 1834 . Having devoted great attention to the study of botany , he went to Athens in 1835 as inspector of the court garden ; and in April 1836 he became professor of botany at the university . In 1842 he returned to Germany and became teacher at the central agricultural school at Schleißheim . In 1847 he was appointed professor of agriculture at Munich , and in 1851 director of the central veterinary college . For many years he was secretary of the Agricultural Society of Bavaria , but resigned in 1861 . He died at his estate of Neufreimann , near Munich .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 His principal works are :   
    
 Synopsis plantarum florae classicae ( Munich , 1845 ) ;   
 Klima und Pflanzenwelt in der Zeit ( Landshut , 1847 ) ;   
 Historisch-encyklopädischer Grundriß der Landwirthschaftslehre ( Stuttgart , 1848 ) ;

 Geschichte der Landbau und Forstwissenschaft seit dem 16 Jahrh . ( Munich , 1865 ) .He also founded and edited a weekly agricultural paper , the Schranne .   
    
    
 == Karl Marx 's references to Fraas ==   
 Karl Marx took an interest in Fraas 's work , writing to Engels on 25 March 1868 that he found Fraas 's 1847 work Climate and the Vegetable World throughout the Ages , a History of Both `` very interesting , especially as proving that climate and flora have changed in historic times '' .   
 Marx calls Fraas `` a Darwinist before Darwin '' and goes on to say : This man is both a thoroughly learned philologist ( he has written books in Greek ) and a chemist , agricultural expert , etc . The whole conclusion is that cultivation when it progresses in a primitive way and is not consciously controlled ( as a bourgeois of course he does not arrive at this ) , leaves deserts behind it , Persia , Mesopotamia , etc. , Greece . Here again another unconscious socialist tendency ! These references to Fraas are of interest to recent scholars of Marx 's ecological ideas .

 == Greiling 's predictions till 2100 ==   
 Greiling , in his work Wie werden wir leben ? Ein Buch von den Aufgaben unserer Zeit ( How are we going to live ? A book of the tasks of our time ; 1954 ) , foresaw the rest of the 20th century as a time in which there would , for the present , further be overexploited natural resources . He foretold that from 1990 to 1995 , there would begin systematic international efforts to mitigate climate change and that , shortly after the turn of the millennium , there would for the first time come about a sudden and crisis-laden shortage of the international supply of petroleum . World population would balance out at about nine billion , rather earlier than later in the 21st century . During the 21st century , mankind would succeed to cooperate internationally in shifting to biological raw materials . This and big undertakings to humidify the Sahara , Turkestan and further regions of the Earth would make it possible to feed ten billion people with comparative ease . Greiling warns of attempts to use nuclear energy . He starts the question how one would handle the newly gained wealth , once the pressing difficulties would be overcome so that people would be urged to pause for inspiration .

 = Sydney Parkinson =   
Sydney Parkinson ( c. 1745 – 26 January 1771 ) was a Scottish botanical illustrator and natural history artist . He was the first European artist to visit Australia , New Zealand and Tahiti.Parkinson was employed by Joseph Banks to travel with him on James Cook 's first voyage to the Pacific in 1768 , in HMS Endeavour . Parkinson made nearly a thousand drawings of plants and animals collected by Banks and Daniel Solander on the voyage . He had to work in difficult conditions , living and working in a small cabin surrounded by hundreds of specimens . In Tahiti he was plagued by swarms of flies which ate the paint as he worked . He died at sea on the way to Cape Town of dysentery contracted at Princes ' Island off the western end of Java . Banks paid his outstanding salary to his brother .   
 Parkinson is commemorated in the common and scientific name of the Parkinson 's petrel Procellaria parkinsoni . The great Florilegium of his work was finally published in 1988 by Alecto Historical Editions in 35 volumes and has since been digitized by the Natural History Museum in London .   
 In 1986 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post [ 1 ]

 = Valentine Dencausse =   
Valentine Dencausse ( 20 May 1871 – 16 February 1954 ) , best known as Madame Fraya was a famous chiromancer in Paris during the first half of the 20th century .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Madame Fraya would use a person 's hand and handwriting to predict his/her future , but she admitted to not following the principles of traditional chiromancy , and just making use of her instinctual knowledge . Her clients included important French artists and politicians of the time , such as the Princess of Saxe-Meningen ( sister of emperor Wilhelm II of Germany ) , to whom she reportedly predicted World War I and the defeat of Germany in it . She was subsequently called into the French Ministry of War , where she assured the government that the marching German troops would not reach Paris ( they were in fact stopped at the First Battle of the Marne ) . The abilities displayed by Fraya were studied by Alfred Binet , Eugéne Osty , and Albert von Schrenck-Notzing .   
 Biographer Simone de Tervagne has written several books about Fraya .   
    
    
 == Investigations ==   
 In December 1929 , Antônio da Silva Mello attended a psychic reading session with Madame Fraya . Mello brought with him some letters . Fraya made totally inaccurate statements about the letters , for example on studying a letter that Mello had written the same morning she stated it was written by someone else and gave excessively general characterisation details that would be applicable to most people . She said one of the letters had been written by a man but it had actually been written by a female relative of Mello.Fraya also gave many false statements to Mello . She said he was the father of two children when he did not have any . She examined his hand and stated he was thirty-two years old , although he was forty-three at the time . Mello noted that `` the revelations obtained in my consultation with Madame Fraya were no more than vague generalities , which would be commonly applied to any person . `` Mello also attended a session with Fraya in January , 1930 . The result was a complete failure , she made many incorrect statements . Mello `` left her office annoyed and disillusioned '' .Fraya duped the psychical researcher Eugéne Osty into believing she had genuine psychic powers .

She graduated from high school in Basel in 1940 and went to Basel University to study medicine with the ambition of being a brain surgeon . However she was discouraged from pursuing this ambition by specialists in Switzerland as she was `` too short , female and appeared frail ! '' She switched to studying Zoology from 1943-48 achieving a D.Phil with her thesis on non-human brains , with Adolf Portmann , as her supervisor being published in 1950 in Acta Anatomica . She was awarded a 3 year scholarship at the Janggen-Pöhn Foundation of St Gallen to carry out research on Opisthobranchs from 1950 in Villefranche-sur-Mer and Banyuls-sur-Mer . In 1951 she was appointed as a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherché Scientifique and her focus from then was on the biology of cephalopods . Portmann acted as her mentor until he died in 1982.In 1958 she married Walter Mangold and in 1961 she was awarded the Doctorat ès Sciences ( Doctorat d'état ) from the University of Paris with her thesis being published in Vie et Meileu . In that year she was also promoted to Research Fellow at the Centre National de la Recherché Scientifique and in 1966 she was appointed as a Senior Researcher . In 1969 overseas recognition came with her appointment as a visiting Research Professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland . Further recognition came in 1983 when she was elected as the first president of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council at their meeting in Banyuls-sur-Mer . She retired from academia in 1987 but she continued as an active scientist .

 Roller was born in Brünn ( Brno ) , Moravia . He at first studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna under Christian Griepenkerl and Eduard Peithner von Lichtenfels , but eventually became disenchanted with the Academy 's traditionalism . In 1897 he co-founded the Viennese Secession with Koloman Moser , Joseph Maria Olbrich , Josef Hoffmann , Gustav Klimt , and other artists who rejected the prevalent academic style of art . He became a professor of drawing at the University of Applied Arts Vienna ( Kunstgewerbeschule ) in 1899 , and president of the Secession in 1902 .   
 In his early career Roller was very active as a graphic designer and draughtsman . He designed numerous covers and vignettes for the pages the Secessionist periodical Ver Sacrum , as well as the posters for the fourth , fourteenth , and sixteenth Secession exhibitions . He also designed the layout of the exhibitions themselves .   
 In 1902 Roller was introduced to the composer Gustav Mahler by Carl Moll . Roller expressed an interest in stage design and showed Mahler several sketches he had made for Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde . Mahler was impressed and decided to employ Roller to design the sets for a new production of the piece . The production , which premiered in February 1903 , was a great critical success . Roller continued to design sets for Mahler 's productions . Eventually Roller left the Secession and his teaching post at the Kunstgewerbeschule to be appointed chief stage designer to the Vienna State Opera , a position he held until 1909 . He died in Vienna in 1935 .   
 Alfred Roller 's brother-in-law was the World War I flying ace Raoul Stojsavljevic ( 1887–1930 ) .

 = Anton Schr C3 B6tter von Kristelli =   
Anton Schrötter von Kristelli ( 26 November 1802 – 15 April 1875 ) was an Austrian chemist and mineralogist born in Olomouc , Moravia . His son Leopold Schrötter Ritter von Kristelli ( 1837–1908 ) was a noted laryngologist .   
    
    
 == Academic background ==   
 Anton 's father was an apothecary . He initially studied medicine in Vienna at the request of his father , but switched to the natural sciences under the influence of Friedrich Mohs ( 1773–1839 ) . In 1827 he became an assistant to mathematician Andreas von Ettingshausen ( 1796–1878 ) and to physicist Andreas von Baumgartner ( 1793–1865 ) at the University of Vienna . Three years later he was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the Joanneum Technical Institute in Graz , and from 1843 served as a professor of technical chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna . In 1845 he succeeded Paul Traugott Meissner ( 1778–1864 ) as chair of chemistry . In 1868 he was appointed Master of the Austrian State Mint ( Münze Österreich ) . Declining health made him retire in 1874 .   
    
    
 == Contributions ==   
 As a chemist he conducted research involving reactions of metals with ammonia at higher temperatures , and performed investigations of substances such as amber , idrialite , ozokerite , asphalt and dopplerite . He also investigated the reactive behavior of potassium in liquid nitrous oxide , of phosphorus and antimony in liquid chlorine , and of iron towards oxygen at very low temperatures . In 1845 he discovered a process for preparing red phosphorus , a development which led to the invention of the safety match.He was a scientific consultant to the Novara Expedition ( 1857–59 ) , as well as to the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition . His name is associated with the Schrötterhorn of the Ortlergruppe in the Alps and `` Cape Schrötter '' on Franz Josef Land.With Ettingshausen , Baumgartner and Wilhelm von Haidinger ( 1795–1871 ) , he was a founding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences , serving as its secretary from 1851 until his death . Since 1876 , the Schröttergasse in the Favoriten district of Vienna has been named in his honor .

 = Bror Emil Hildebrand =   
Bror Emil Hildebrand ( 22 February 1806 in Madesjö – 30 August 1884 ) was a Swedish archaeologist , numismatist and museum director . From 1837 to 1879 he was Custodian of Ancient Monuments and Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters . From 1847 he was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and from 1866 a member of the Swedish Academy . In 1866 , he founded the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.In 1830 Hildebrand became reader in numismatics at the University of Lund . About this time he was also taught archaeology by C.J . Thomsen in nearby Copenhagen : thus Hildebrand introduced the three-age system to Sweden . His main scholarly legacy lies within the field of Medieval Anglo-Saxon numismatics , where he produced pioneering catalogues and studies . Much of this work was indirectly due to agricultural reforms in Sweden that led to Viking Period silver coin hoards surfacing at a rate never seen before or after Hildebrand 's day ; the 1864 edition of Hildebrand 's Anglo-Saxon coins in the Swedish Royal Coin Cabinet drew on the evidence of 64 Swedish hoards alongside other European finds to establish the basic chronology of the late Anglo-Saxon coinage , much of which has remained valid after more than a century of subsequent research.Hildebrand was the father of archaeologist Hans Hildebrand and teacher both to him and to archaeologist Oscar Montelius .

 = George H. Hitchings =   
George Herbert Hitchings ( April 18 , 1905 – February 27 , 1998 ) was an American doctor who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sir James Black and Gertrude Elion `` for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment '' , Hitchings specifically for his work on chemotherapy .   
    
    
 == Education and early life ==   
 Hitchings was born in Hoquiam , Washington , in 1905 , and grew up there , in Berkeley , California , San Diego , Bellingham , Washington , and Seattle . He graduated from Seattle 's Franklin High School , where he was salutatorian , in 1923 , and from there went to the University of Washington , from which he graduated with a degree in chemistry cum laude in 1927 , after having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior the year before . That summer , he worked at the university 's Puget Sound Biological Station at Friday Harbor on San Juan Island [ 1 ] , and received a master 's degree the next year for his thesis based on that work .   
 From the University of Washington , Hitchings went to Harvard University as a teaching fellow , ending up at Harvard Medical School . Before getting his Ph.D. in 1933 , he joined Alpha Chi Sigma in 1929 .

 Following his PhD , he worked at Harvard and Case Western Reserve University . In 1942 , he went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories at Tuckahoe , where he began working with Gertrude Elion in 1944 . Drugs Hitchings ' team worked on included 2,6-diaminopurine ( a compound to treat leukemia ) and p-chlorophenoxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine ( a folic acid antagonist ) . According to his Nobel Prize autobiography ,   
    
 The line of inquiry we had begun in the 1940s [ also ] yielded new drug therapies for malaria ( pyrimethamine ) , leukemia ( 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine ) , gout ( allopurinol ) , organ transplantation ( azathioprine ) and bacterial infections ( co-trimoxazole ( trimethoprimA ) ) . The new knowledge contributed by our studies pointed the way for investigations that led to major antiviral drugs for herpes infections ( acyclovir ) and AIDS ( zidovudine ) .In 1967 Hitchings became Vice President in Charge of Research of Burroughs-Wellcome . He became Scientist Emeritus in 1976 . He also served as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1970 to 1985 at Duke University . Hitchings died in 1998 in Chapel Hill , North Carolina . Hitchings founded the Triangle Community Foundation in 1983 . Hitchings is a member of the Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame . His first wife , Beverly Reimer Hitchings , died in 1985 . Hitchings remarried in 1989 to Joyce Carolyn Shaver-Hitchings , MD . Dr. Shaver-Hitchings died in 2009 .

 = Julius Faucher =   
Julius Faucher ( 13 June 1820 in Berlin – 12 June 1878 in Rome ) was a German journalist and a significant advocate of liberalism and free trade . He was one of the first to advocate privatizing the security functions of the state , which would eliminate taxation , therefore coming up with `` a form of individualist anarchism , or , as it would be called today , anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism '' .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Faucher 's father , a Huguenot , was a member of the French colony in Berlin , where Faucher was educated . In 1845 , Faucher married Karoline Sommerbrodt , daughter of a hat-maker from Berlin , with whom he later had a daughter , Lucie , `` the greatest joy of his eventful life '' .In 1844 , Faucher got to know John Prince-Smith and became an advocate of Manchester Liberalism . Thus , they founded the Free Trade Association of Berlin ( which did not have much influence ) and the Free Trade-newspaper Börsennachrichten an der Ostsee , later becoming the Ostseezeitung . In this newspaper , they advanced a laissez-faire trade policy . It was in this time that Faucher attended the regular meetings of several left-wing Hegelians and economists , including Max Stirner , at the Hippel Restaurant in Friedrichstraße . When the Revolutions of 1848 took place , Faucher entered combat on 18–19 March in Stockholm ( Marsoroligheterna ) .In 1850 , Faucher became editor of the newspaper Berliner Abendpost , of which he was the founder . After facing conflicts with the Prussian government about his free trade points of view , including suppression of his newspaper , Faucher emigrated to England . There , he joined the staff of the Morning Star and became correspondent for several German newspapers and later secretary to Richard Cobden .   
 Faucher returned to Prussia in 1861 , where he advocate strenuously for the liberty of domicile , free trade and freedom in industry . He was elected to the Abgeordnetenhaus ( a semi-parliament ) for the German Progress Party . In 1863 , he founded the newspaper Vierteljahrzeitschrift für Volkswirtschaft und Kulturgeschichte ( Quarterly Journal for Economics and Cultural History ) . During the Franco-Prussian War , he was correspondent of the London Daily News with the German armies.In 1866 , Faucher left the Progress Party and founded with 14 other Progress Party members and 9 members of the Zentrumspartei a new party , the National Liberal Party . The reason for the split-off was Otto von Bismarck 's Indemnitätsvorlage as the Progress Party voted against it while the National Liberals were on the side of Chancellor Bismarck ( who broke the budget law to finance the war against Austria ) .

 = Arne Beurling =   
Arne Carl-August Beurling ( 3 February 1905 – 20 November 1986 ) was a Swedish mathematician and professor of mathematics at Uppsala University ( 1937–1954 ) and later at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey . Beurling worked extensively in harmonic analysis , complex analysis and potential theory . The `` Beurling factorization '' helped mathematical scientists to understand the Wold decomposition , and inspired further work on the invariant subspaces of linear operators and operator algebras , e.g . Håkan Hedenmalm 's factorization theorem for Bergman spaces .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Beurling was born in Gothenburg , Sweden and was the son of the landowner Konrad Beurling and baroness Elsa Raab . After graduating in 1924 , he was enrolled at the Uppsala University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1926 and two years later a Licentiate of Philosophy degree . Beurling was assistant teacher at Uppsala University from 1931 to 1933 . He received his doctorate in mathematics in 1933 for his dissertation Études sur un problème de majoration . Beurling was a docent of mathematics at Uppsala University from 1933 and then professor of mathematics from 1937 to 1954 . He was visiting professor at Harvard University from 1948 to 1949 . From 1954 he was professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University , United States , where he took over Albert Einstein 's office .   
    
    
 == World War II ==   
 In the summer of 1940 he single-handedly deciphered and reverse-engineered an early version of the Siemens and Halske T52 also known as the Geheimfernschreiber ( `` secret teletypewriter '' ) used by Nazi Germany in World War II for sending ciphered messages . The T52 was one of the so-called `` Fish cyphers '' , that , using transposition , created nearly one quintillion ( 893,622,318,929,520,960 ) different variations . It took Beurling two weeks to solve the problem using pen and paper . Using Beurling 's work , a device was created that enabled Sweden to decipher German teleprinter traffic passing through Sweden from Norway on a cable . In this way , Swedish authorities knew about Operation Barbarossa before it occurred . Since the Swedes would not reveal how this knowledge was attained , the Swedish warning was not treated as credible by Soviets .   
 This became the foundation for the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment ( FRA ) . The cypher in the Geheimfernschreiber is generally considered to be more complex than the cypher used in the Enigma machines .   
    
    
 == Later life ==   
 Beurling was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970 . He was the doctoral advisor of Lennart Carleson and Carl-Gustav Esseen .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Beurling was in his first marriage married 1936-40 with the licentiate in medicine Britta Östberg ( born 1907 ) , daughter of lector Henrik Östberg and Ph.D. Gerda Nilsson . He remarried in 1950 with a M.Phil . Karin Lindblad ( 1920-2006 ) , daughter of ironmonger Henric Lindblad and Wanja Bengtsson . Karin was a distinguished Ph.D student from Uppsala University . When they lived in Princeton , she worked in a biochemistry lab at Princeton University . Beurling was in the first marriage the father of Pehr-Henrik ( born 1936 ) and Jane ( born 1938 ) .Beurling died in 1986 and was buried at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm .   
 Beurling 's great-grandfather was Per Henric Beurling ( 1758 or 1763 – 1806 ) , who founded a high quality clock factory in Stockholm in 1783 .

Ralph Wendell Burhoe ( May 21 or June 21 , 1911 – May 8 , 1997 ) was an important twentieth century pioneer interpreter of the importance of religion for a scientific and technological world . He was awarded the Templeton Prize in 1980 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Ralph Wendell Burhoe was born on 21 June 1911 , in Somerville , Massachusetts . He attended Harvard University from 1928 to 1932 as a student of meteorology and climatology , though never completing his degree . He then entered Andover Newton Theological School . Burhoe spent eighteen months in theological study at Andover . Instead of becoming a minister as he had planned , he returned to Harvard University as an employee of the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory , finding some success as a scientist . He went on to become the first full-time executive director of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences starting in 1947 . His position at the AAAS brought him into close contact with such eminent scientists as the astronomer Harlow Shapley , the geologist Kirtley Mather , and the biologist George Wald . While there , he was one of the founders of the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science . In 1965 , Burhoe joined the faculty at the Meadville Lombard Theological School , the Unitarian Universalist seminary then in Hyde Park , Chicago . There he facilitated the founding of Zygon : Journal of Religion and Science and the Center for Advanced Study in Religion and Science ( CASIRAS ) . After retiring from Meadville in 1974 he was affiliated with the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago , where in 1988 he founded the Chicago Center for Religion and Science . His ashes are interred in the crypt at First Unitarian Church of Chicago where he was a member .

 = Harrison Gray Dyar Jr. =   
Harrison Gray Dyar Jr. ( February 14 , 1866 in New York City – January 21 , 1929 in Washington , D.C. ) was an American entomologist .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 He was a son of Harrison Gray Dyar and his wife Eleonora Rosella ( née Hannum ) . Dyar graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1889 with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry . He had begun to study insects as a young teenager , and soon after his graduation from college began publishing scientific papers about them , in particular moths of the family Limacodidae , starting a lifelong interest in entomology . He was awarded a Master of Arts degree in biology from Columbia University in 1894 , with his thesis on the classification of Lepidoptera , and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1895 , with his dissertation on airborne bacteria in New York City .   
    
    
 == Taxonomy ==   
 Dyar was a taxonomist who published extensively on moths and butterflies ( Lepidoptera ) , mosquitoes ( Diptera : Culicidae ) , and sawflies ( Hymenoptera : Symphyta ) during his working lifetime . His first job was as assistant bacteriologist of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University from 1895 to 1897 . From 1897 until his death he was honorary custodian of Lepidoptera at the U.S. National Museum , Washington , D.C. Dyar was independently wealthy and for a major part of his 31 years at the USNM he worked without compensation ; his independence also made it possible for him to travel and collect extensively within North America.Dyar 's Law , a biological rule named for him in recognition of his original observations on the geometric progression in head capsule widths during the larval development of Lepidoptera , is a standard tool for studying immature insects . An earlier publication in 1886 by W.K . Brooks independently described the same phenomenon in crustaceans , and therefore the variant term `` Brooks-Dyar Law '' ( or `` Brooks Rule '' or `` Brooks-Dyar Rule '' ) also commonly appears in the literature.Dyar was editor of the Journal of the New York Entomological Society from 1904 to 1907 and of the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington from 1909 to 1912 ; from 1913 to 1926 he published and edited his own taxonomic journal , Insecutor Inscitiae Menstruus . Dyar and Frederick Knab were primarily responsible for the taxonomic portions of The Mosquitoes of North and Central America and the West Indies , published , with co-author L. O. Howard , in four volumes from 1912–1917.Dyar was also noted for his intellectual and at times acerbic exchanges with fellow entomologists , for example , in correspondence with Clara Southmayd Ludlow , he engaged in a `` protracted , spectacularly belligerent feud with fellow entomologists '' .In 1924 , Dyar was commissioned a captain in the Sanitary Department of the U.S. Army Reserve Officers Corps because of his background in the study of mosquitoes .   
    
    
 == Personal ==   
 Dyar was a bigamist , `` for fourteen years he was married to two women , maintaining two families with five children in all . '' He married Zella M. Peabody of Los Angeles , a music teacher in 1889 . They had two children . This marriage ended in 1920 . But in 1906 , using the alias of Wilfred P. Allen , Dyar married Wellesca Pollock . In 1921 , now divorced from Peabody , Dyar legally married Pollock ; they had three sons.Pollock was an educator and ardent disciple of the Bahá ' í Faith . After his legal marriage to Pollock , Dyar became active in the Bahá ' í Faith , and edited an independent Bahá ' í journal , Reality , from 1922 until his death.During the 1920s , Dyar 's hobby of tunnel building was discovered when a truck broke through into a labyrinth of tunnels near his former home in Washington , D.C.Dyar was a second cousin of American Civil War soldier and publisher Harrison Gray Otis .

Sir Clifford Charles Butler FRS ( 20 May 1922 – 30 June 1999 ) was an English physicist , best known for the discovery of the hyperon and meson types of particles . In later life , Butler was involved in educational policy , serving as director of the Nuffield Foundation and vice-chancellor of Loughborough University .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Butler was born in Reading on 20 May 1922 , the son of Charles Hannington James Butler , a clerk and buyer to a local wholesale grocer , and his wife Olive Pembroke . He attended both Reading School and the University of Reading , becoming both a Bachelor of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy there . He was appointed assistant lecturer in physics at the University of Manchester in 1945 , and lecturer in 1947 . In the same year he married Kathleen Betty Collins . They had two daughters . He died in Leicester on 30 June 1999 .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 At Manchester , Butler worked with G. D. Rochester , studying cosmic rays using a cloud chamber . During this research , they found two unexpected events , one in October 1946 and one in May 1947 , showing previously unknown particles . These V particles were a thousand times heavier than the electron and long-lived on nuclear timescales . In order to increase the rate of detection with a higher flux of cosmic rays , the equipment was moved to the Pic du Midi de Bigorre observatory in the Pyrenees . The existence of the particles was confirmed by a group from the California Institute of Technology led by Carl Anderson , and the Butler group continued to study them and found that there were two types , hyperons and mesons . Butler 's and Rochester 's discovery may be seen as the first step towards understanding of the quark structure of matter.In 1953 , Butler left Manchester to lead a high-energy nuclear physics group at Imperial College in London . He was promoted to professor in 1957 , and head of the physics department in 1963 . While at Imperial College London , Butler chaired the consortium established to design the British National Hydrogen Bubble Chamber , which was operated at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and CERN . From 1964 , he chaired the CERN Track Chamber Committee.. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1961 , and served as dean of the Royal College of Science between 1966 and 1969 . Over this period he became increasingly interested in educational policy , joining the academic planning board of the University of Kent in 1963 , the Schools Council in 1965 , and the University Grants Committee in 1966 . He eventually served on the Schools Council for 19 years.In 1970 , Butler resigned from Imperial College and his active involvement in physical research ceased . He accepted the role of director of the Nuffield Foundation , a charitable foundation influential in education . During his time there he set up a group for research and innovation in higher education , a programme for law and society , and the centre for agricultural strategy at the University of Reading . His role in the establishment of the Open University was also important , since the Nuffield Foundation funded a course on genetics as a test bed for other courses . He was appointed to the council of the Open University in 1971 and stayed as a member until 1995 , serving as vice-chairman from 1986 to 1995 . In 1975 , Butler was appointed vice-chancellor of Loughborough University , retaining that post until he retired in 1985 .

 == Life ==   
 Margaret Gilpin Reid was born in 1896 in Cardale , Manitoba in Canada , and completed a degree in Home Economics at the University of Manitoba in 1921 . She received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1931 titled The Economics of Household Production . She taught at Connecticut College , Iowa State College ( Iowa State University ) and later the University of Chicago , where she received tenure as a Professor of Home Economics and Economics . She became emeritus in 1961.Reid served as an economic advisor to the Division of Statistical Standards during 1943 and 1944 . She served as the Head of Family Economics for the Department of Agriculture . She returned to academia in 1948 as a full professor in economics at the University of Chicago . She was also a member of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities .   
    
    
 == Economics ==   
 Margaret G. Reid was a pioneer in the research on the importance of non-market activities , especially of the household for the economy . Her work included household production and consumption , relationships between health , income and productivity and housework.Her first book , Economics of Household Production , was published in 1934 . Reid , like her PhD advisor Hazel Kyrk , sought to theorize the productive contribution made by domestic activities within the household . She was arguing for a national accounting that included non-market activities to better mirror economic activities . Furthermore , she called for the recognition of unpaid work and delivered a pragmatic definition for work itself as activities that have a positive utility and could be transferred through a market ( even if they are not produced for a market ) . Feminist economists would later argue that this work was underappreciated and even ignored , pointing out its similarity to Gary Becker 's 1965 Nobel-prize winning theory of time allocation.After becoming emeritus , she continued to research and write until her death in 1991 . In later years her work was preoccupied with the relationship between demographic factors such as age , race , health , and income , and productivity and consumption .   
 The American Economic Association named Reid a Distinguished Fellow in 1980 , recognizing her as a `` truly tireless colleague '' whose contributions to the field were complemented by a `` felicitous sense of humour . '' In 1996 Feminist Economics devoted an issue to recognizing her research .

Johannes Crellius ( Polish : Jan Crell , English : John Crell ; 26 July 1590 in Hellmitzheim – 11 June 1633 in Raków ) was a Polish and German theologian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Johann Crell 's father , Johann Crell Sr. , was pastor of the church at Hellmitzheim , ( today part of Iphofen in Kitzingen District ) , in Franken , northern Bavaria . His son Krzysztof Crell-Spinowski ( 1622–1680 ) , and his grandsons Christopher Crell Jr. M.D . of London ( 1658- ) , Samuel Crellius ( 1660–1747 ) and Paweł Crell-Spinowski ( 1677- ) , as well as his great-grandsons in Georgia , United States , were all proponents of Socinian views .   
 Crellius moved to Poland at the age of 22 , and quickly became known as one of the chief theologians of the Socinians , also known as Polish brethren . From 1613 he worked at the Racovian Academy at Raków , of which he was the rector from 1616 to 1621 . In 1630 he worked with Joachim Stegmann Sr. in the production of a German version of the Racovian New Testament .   
    
    
 == Influence ==   
 Several of Crell 's works were printed first by Rodecki and Sternacki at the printery of the Racovian Academy 1602-1638 . These and others then appeared as Vol.III-V of Frans Kuyper 's Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant ( `` Library of the Polish Brethren called Unitarians '' ) Amsterdam 1668 Crell also featured in Christopher Sand 's bibliography and biographical collection Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum ( 1684 ) . These works were widely distributed being owned by Voltaire , John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers.Two of Crell 's works were translated into English . First , A Learned and Exceeding Well-Compiled Vindication of Liberty of Religion ( London : 1646 ) . Second , The Two Books ... Touching on God the Father : Wherein Many Things Also Concerning the Nature of the Son of God , and the Holy Spirit are Discoursed of . The first edition was published in Konigsburg ( 1665 ) . A second edition was published in London ( 1691 ) . It was re-titled The Unity of God Answered and Defended , but with the exception of the title page it was identical to the first edition.Knowledge of Crell 's works passed out of the later generations of English Unitarians . However Thomas Belsham is one of the Unitarian authors who had access to Crell in the Latin and he repeatedly cites Crell in his The Epistles of Paul the Apostle Translated , with an Exposition , and Notes ( 1822 ) .

 = Walter Cradock =   
Walter Cradock ( Craddock , Cradoc ) ( c. 1606 – 1659 ) was a Welsh Anglican clergyman , who became a travelling evangelical preacher . He was a founder of the first Independent church in Wales in 1638 , at Llanvaches , with William Wroth and William Thomas , an early Baptist .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born at Trefela , near Llangwm , Monmouthshire , and is believed to have been educated at the University of Oxford . His first position was as a curate , at Peterston-super-Ely , Glamorgan.In 1633 William Erbery , Vicar of St.Mary 's , Cardiff , Cradock his curate there , and William Wroth , were reported to William Laud , and the Court of High Commission turned them out for unorthodox preaching , and on the technical grounds and acid test of orthodoxy , of refusing to read the Book of Sports . From late in 1634 Cradock spent almost a year in Wrexham , preaching , and making a convert of Morgan Llwyd . From there Cradock had to move to Herefordshire , where he met Vavasor Powell . With John Miles , Cradock , Erbery , Powell , and Llwyd are the group of recognised Puritan leaders , who founded the later Welsh Nonconformist congregations , whether Baptist , Congregationalist , Presbyterian or Quaker.He was also at Shrewsbury at this period . Sir Robert Harley , of Brampton Bryan , Herefordshire , took Cradock in , during 1639 . He moved on to Llanfair Waterdine , and an independent congregation there . On the outbreak of the English Civil War the Llanvaches congregation , an independent conventicle , moved with Cradock to Bristol , where there was an independent church at Broadmead . Since royalist forces then occupied Bristol , in 1643 , some moved again to London , and made contact with Henry Jessey , who had been a supporter of the congregation from the start ; Cradock preached with Jessey at All-Hallows-the-Great.In 1641 Cradock was in the group of preachers for Wales authorized by the Long Parliament : others were Erbery , Ambrose Mostyn , Richard Symonds , and Henry Walter . These Welsh radicals formed a tight and effective lobbying group , and held together until the mid-1650s . Parliament renewed similar authority , in 1645 and 1646 , with funding ; it was also specified that Symonds , Henry Walter and Cradock should preach in Welsh . Cradock had already shown he could do that in 1645 , preaching to captured royalist Welshman after the battle of Naseby.He was one of the “ Welsh saints ” , who commanded troops of Thomas Harrison with Vavasor Powell and Jenkin Jones . He was later appointed the regular preacher to Barebone 's Parliament , at St. Margaret 's , Westminster.He was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell , and when controversy arose over Cromwell 's Protectorate , he condemned Vavasor Powell 's anti-Cromwell pamphlet The Word of God . The majority of the Welsh Puritan group of which he had been a founder agreed with him . He withdrew , to a living at Llangwm .

 = Friedrich Goltz =   
Friedrich Leopold Goltz ( 14 August 1834 in Posen ( Poznań ) , Grand Duchy of Posen – 5 May 1902 in Straßburg ( Strasbourg ) ) was a German physiologist and nephew of the writer Bogumil Goltz .   
 He studied medicine at the University of Königsberg , and following two years of surgical training , served as a prosector of anatomy in Königsberg . In 1870 he succeeded A.W . Volkmann as professor of physiology at the University of Halle , followed by a professorship at the University of Straßburg ( from 1872 ) . He is known for his experiments in neurophysiology , and is credited as being the first scientist to perform a hemispherectomy on a dog .   
 In 1870 he introduced the `` hydrostatic concept '' involving the semicircular canals of the inner ear and their ability to transmit sensations of position , and therefore providing assistance in equilibrioception . Goltz proposed that the canals dealt mainly with the equilibrium of the head , and that the movements of the body were regulated by the more or less conscious awareness an individual has of the position of his head in space.Goltz held a unitary view of brain function , which he demonstrated in London at the International Medical Congress of 1881 . Here he showed that a dog with sections of its cerebral cortex removed , could still remain functional . Conversely , Scottish neurologist David Ferrier held the belief of localization of cerebral functions , which he demonstrated at the same conference . Ferrier presented macaque monkeys with particular paralysis following specific surgeries of the motor cortex . Ferrier 's demonstration of localized functionality impressed the medical community , and was seen as a major impetus in the development of neurological surgery .

 = Reid Bryson =   
Reid Bryson ( 7 June 1920 – 11 June 2008 ) was an American atmospheric scientist , geologist and meteorologist . He was a professor emeritus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison . He completed a B.A . in geology at Denison University in 1941 and a Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Chicago in 1948 . In 1946 he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin–Madison , and in 1948 he became the founder and first chairman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison 's Department of Meteorology and Center for Climatic Research . He was the first director of the Institute for Environmental Studies ( now the Nelson Institute ) in 1970.In 1944 , during World War II , he was one of the few meteorologists who accurately identified Typhoon Cobra , which savaged Halsey 's Third Fleet .   
 Bryson was made a Global Laureate by the United Nations Global Environment Program in 1990 .   
    
    
 == Views ==   
 Bryson 's main contribution to the debate on climate change was the idea of `` the human volcano '' causing global cooling , via an increase in aerosol loading . This idea was sparked in 1962 by his own observation , while flying across India en route to a conference , that his view of the ground was blocked not by clouds but by dust . At the time , the instrumental temperature record did not show unambiguous warming and the view that the earth might be cooling , and heading for further cooling , was not unreasonable . Others , including Hubert Lamb , who created a Dust Veil Index , thought volcanoes were more responsible for global-scale aerosol.In 1973 , Bryson testified to Congress that global warming from fossil-fuel combustion was politically unstoppable .   
    
 There is no way right now that we can control the climate to make it more benign . Even if we were to say `` let us stop using fossil fuels so that we do not add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , because that impacts the world climate , '' how on earth could you stop using fossil fuels ? Even those countries that are most heavily impacted by the climatic change are the ones who say it is our turn to be affluent and it is in the use of fossil fuels that one gains affluence.In later years , when it was clear that the climate was indeed warming , Bryson argued that while climate change and a global increase in temperature are real , he did not believe that they are caused by human activity . Rather , he argued that they are part of natural global climate cycles , particularly the end of the Little Ice Age :   
    
 `` All this argument is the temperature going up or not , it ’ s absurd , '' Bryson continues . `` Of course it ’ s going up . It has gone up since the early 1800s , before the Industrial Revolution , because we ’ re coming out of the Little Ice Age , not because we ’ re putting more carbon dioxide into the air . ''

On her return in 1910 , she became assistant to George Massee , head of mycology and cryptogams at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew . On his retirement in 1915 , she took over his position as head of mycology .   
 In 1920 , she took advantage of a travelling scholarship from Somerville College to spend six months working as a mycologist in the West Indies . Subsequently , she remained at Kew until her retirement in 1951 , working on British and tropical fungi , with a particular interest in corticioid and tomentelloid species . She was a specialist in Basidiomycota and recognised internationally for knowledge of the Aphyllophorales . During this time , she also published several papers on plant pathology . R.W.G . Dennis joined her as an assistant in 1944 , becoming head of mycology on her retirement .   
 Elsie Wakefield was elected President of the British Mycological Society in 1929 . She was awarded an OBE in 1950.During her career , she published almost 100 papers on fungi and plant pathology , together with two popular field guides to the larger British fungi . She described many new species , from Britain and overseas . The fungal genera Wakefieldia and Wakefieldiomyces are named after her , as are the species Aleurodiscus wakefieldiae , Amaurodon wakefieldiae , Brachysporium wakefieldiae , Crepidotus wakefieldiae , Hypochnicium wakefieldiae , Pneumocystis wakefieldiae , Poria wakefieldiae , and Postia wakefieldiae .

 = Thomas Attwood (economist) =   
Thomas Attwood ( 6 October 1783 – 6 March 1856 ) was a British banker , economist , political campaigner and Member of Parliament . He was the leading figure of the underconsumptionist Birmingham School of economists , and , as the founder of the Birmingham Political Union , the leading figure in the public campaign for the Great Reform Act of 1832 .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Thomas Attwood was born in Halesowen , then a detached part of Shropshire , and attended Halesowen Grammar School ( now Earls High School ) before being moved to Wolverhampton Grammar School . On 12 May 1806 , Attwood married Elizabeth Carless from Lower Ravenhurst Farm , an area which is now part of the Moor Pool estate . They had two sons , George de Bosco Attwood ( 15 March 1808 ) and Thomas Aurelius Attwood ( 4 March 1810 ) . Their daughter Angela married Daniel Wakefield with whom she emigrated to New Zealand.He founded the Birmingham Political Union in 1830 . This was a political organization campaigning for cities , and large towns such as Birmingham , to be directly represented in Parliament . The Birmingham Political Union was foremost among groups lobbying the government for the passage of a Reform Bill to achieve this aim . The Days of May in 1832 brought the people 's struggle for wider enfranchisement to a head , and the Great Reform Act was passed on 15 May 1832 . After this success he became one of the first two Members of Parliament ( MPs ) for Birmingham ( along with Joshua Scholefield ) on 12 December 1832 , a position he held until 1839 .   
 Attwood lived at The Grove , a Georgian house in Harborne , Birmingham , between 1823 and 1846 . He died in Malvern , Worcestershire in 1856 .

 = Jurij Japelj =   
Jurij Japelj , also known in German as Georg Japel , ( 11 April 1744 – 11 October 1807 ) was a Slovene Jesuit priest , translator , and philologist . He was part of the Zois circle , a group of Carniolan scholars and intellectuals that were instrumental in the spread of Enlightenment ideas in the Slovene Lands . His translations of the Bible , based on the 16th-century translation of the Lutheran author Jurij Dalmatin , set the basis for the development of modern standard Slovene .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 Born in the Upper Carniolan town of Kamnik , then part of the Habsburg Monarchy ( now in Slovenia ) , he studied in Jesuit schools in Ljubljana , Gorizia , and Graz . He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1769 in Trieste , where he served until the Suppression of the Jesuits in 1773 . He then became the personal secretary of Bishop of Ljubljana Karl Herberstein . Under Herberstein 's influence , Japelj became sympathetic to Jansenist ideas .   
 With the support of Bishop Herberstein , Japelj started translating religious texts into Slovene . He rejected the innovations of the Franciscan friar Marko Pohlin , and returned to the language of 16th-century Slovene Protestants , especially Jurij Dalmatin and Adam Bohorič . Together with Blaž Kumerdej , he began a new translation of the Bible in Slovene , based on Jurij Dalmatin 's translation from the 1580s .   
 In 1807 , he started compiling a grammar of Slovene , which , however , remained unfinished . He also translated several poems by Metastasio , Kleist , Racine , Hagedorn , and Pope into Slovene . He also wrote some original poems in a mixture of Classicism , Roccoco , and Sentimentalism .   
 In 1799 , Japelj became the director of the seminary in Klagenfurt , where he also covered other positions in the ecclesiastical and civil administration . He died in Klagenfurt in 1807 , shortly after being appointed bishop of Trieste .

 == Biography ==   
 Gohberg was born in Tarutyne to parents Tsudik and Haya Gohberg . His father owned a small typography shop and his mother was a midwife . The young Gohberg studied in a Hebrew school in Taurtyne and then a Romanian school in Orhei , where he was influenced by the tutelage of Modest Shumbarsky , a student of the renowned topologist Karol Borsuk .   
 He studied at the Kyrgyz Pedagogical Institute in Bishkek and the University of Chişinău , completed his doctorate at Leningrad University on a thesis advised by Mark Krein ( 1954 ) , and attended the University of Moscow for his habilitation degree .

 = Alwyn Gentry =   
Alwyn Howard Gentry ( January 6 , 1945 – August 3 , 1993 ) was an American botanist and plant collector , who made major contributions to the understanding of the vegetation of tropical forests .   
    
    
 == Education ==   
 Gentry was born on January 6 , 1945 in Clay Center , Kansas , and received his schooling at the Clay Center Community High School , from which he graduated in 1963 . He graduated from Kansas State University in 1967 with a B.A . in physical science and a B.S . in botany and zoology . He earned his master 's degree in 1969 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a student of botanist Hugh Iltis , with a thesis on the genus Tabebuia ( Bignoniaceae ) of Central America , a subject which he continued to study at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , from which he received his doctorate in 1972 , with a Ph.D. thesis entitled An Eco-evolutionary Study of the Bignoniaceae of South Central America .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Gentry spent his entire working career at the Missouri Botanical Garden , starting as an assistant curator in October 1972 . In 1974 , he made his first visit to Peru , a country that became the major focus of much of his subsequent work ; he made his second trip there in 1976 and by the time of his death had visited the country 33 times . He also maintained his interest in the Bignoniaceae : he contributed treatments of the family to nine volumes , including the Flora of Panama , and had a further five in press when he died .   
 One of Gentry 's major innovations was the use of transect samples as a tool for assessing the composition and structure of tropical forests , known as the Gentry Forest Transect . His method , allied to his encyclopedic knowledge of tropical plants , allowed him to sample a site in a matter of days , and over the course of his career he amassed data from over 200 such transects worldwide .   
 Alwyn Gentry was prolific both as an author and as a plant collector : he published over 200 works and had many more on hand at the time of his death ; and he collected over 80,000 plant specimens , hundreds of which have proved to be species new to science . Because many of the plants that he encountered during his transect sampling were not flowering , Gentry developed the ability to identify species from vegetative specimens , not just from flowers and fruits , an ability that led to the publication of his Field Guide to the Families and Genera of Woody Plants of Northwest South America , completed just months before his death .   
 In 1990 , Conservation International established a Rapid Assessment Program ( RAP ) to undertake quick assessments of areas deemed to be significant for conservation . Gentry 's transect method was well suited to such work and he became increasingly involved as a member of the RAP team .   
    
    
 == Death ==   
 On August 3 , 1993 , Alwyn Gentry was on a RAP mission in western Ecuador , when the light aircraft in which he was traveling crashed into a mountain ridge near Guayaquil . Four people—the pilot , Gentry , American ornithologist Theodore A. Parker III , and Ecuadorian ecologist Eduardo Aspiazu—died in the crash ; three other researchers survived . Parker and Gentry are memorialized in the annual Parker/Gentry Award for Conservation Biology of the Field Museum of Natural History.Several plant species have been named after Gentry , including : Acidocroton gentryi , Citharexylum gentryi , Crossothamnus gentryi , Eleutherodactylus gentryi , Hedyosmum gentryi , Metalepis gentryi , Palicourea gentryi , Phyllanthus gentryi , Sobralia gentryi and Zamia gentryi , as well as a bird , Herpsilochmus gentryi . In several instances , Gentry had been involved in the collection of the type specimens of these plants .

 = Frederick Valentine Melsheimer =   
The Reverend Frederick Valentine Melsheimer ( September 25 , 1749 , Negenborn , Brunswick – June 30 , 1814 , Hanover , Pennsylvania ) was a Lutheran clergyman and early American entomologist , called the `` Father of American Entomology '' by successor Thomas Say . He was the author of the first major entomological work in the United States : A Catalogue of Insects of Pennsylvania ( 1806 ) , a sixty-page work that describes 1,363 species of beetles .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Melsheimer studied at the university in Helmstedt from 1772 to 1776 before becoming chaplain to the Duke of Brunswick 's Dragoons Regiment . With this regiment he arrived in Canada in 1776 to fight alongside British troops in the American Revolutionary War . He was taken prisoner by the American army on August 16 , 1777 following their victory at the Battle of Bennington and remained in prison for fourteen months . After being released on parole , he resigned from his office of chaplain and began to preach in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania .   
 In May 1779 , he accepted a call as pastor of five Lutheran congregations in Dauphin County . He married Maria Agnes Man on June 3 , 1779 . In 1784 , he moved to Manheim , where he was ordained to the ministry by the Lutheran ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1785 , and was pastor at New Holland from 1786 until 1789 . He was pastor at Hanover from 1790 until 1814 . His service exerted a strong influence on the German colonists of Pennsylvania , and his entomological interests were said to `` furnish some of his parishioners with mild amusement '' .   
 His insect collection , inherited and increased by his second son Frederick Ernst Melsheimer and his son 's friend Daniel Ziegler , was eventually purchased by Harvard University and formed the basis for what is now the largest university-owned collection of insects in the United States . His Catalogue was intended to be a three volume work , but illness prevented publication of more than the first volume , in 1806 .   
 Melsheimer was also interested in mineralogy and astronomy , and served as Professor of Languages at the recently founded Franklin College in 1787 . He died in 1814 of lung disease . Two of his eleven children also devoted themselves to natural history : John Frederick Melsheimer ( 1780-1829 ) and Frederick Ernst Melsheimer ( 1782-1873 ) .

 Alan and Mary had six children : Alan Jr. , an atmospheric physicist who taught at Stanford University , Neil , Barbara , Anne , and Guy , writer , climber , and conservationist . A daughter Mary died in childhood .   
 Possessed of a gentle nature , Alan Waterman was known for his calm and reasoned point of view . He believed in public service . Besides his scientific talents , he was an accomplished musician , revealing his sense of humor by walking the corridors of the National Science Foundation playing his bagpipes . He had a fine voice and singing together was a family ritual . An avid outdoorsman , Dr. Waterman canoed the rivers and lakes of northern Maine during extensive summer trips in the 1930s and 1940s . He was accompanied by his sons and colleagues , in particular Karl Compton , then president of MIT . Dr. Waterman was known to say that becoming a licensed Maine Guide meant possibly more to him than his NSF appointment .   
 The crater Waterman on the Moon is named after him , as is Mount Waterman in the Hughes Range of Antarctica . Since 1975 , the National Science Foundation has annually issued the Alan T. Waterman Award ( named in Waterman 's honor ) to a promising young researcher .

Carlos Berg ( Latvian : Kārlis Bergs , German : Karl Berg ) or Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Berg ( Latvian : Frīdrihs Vilhelms Kārlis Bergs , German : Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Berg ) ( 21 March 1843 , Courland – 19 January 1902 Buenos Aires ) was an Argentinian naturalist and entomologist of Latvian and Baltic German origin .   
 Having worked a few years in trade , he moved to Riga in 1865 and became curator of the entomological department of the Riga Museum , and then at the Riga Technical University .   
 In 1873 , he was invited by Hermann Burmeister ( 1807–1892 ) , director of the Museum of Buenos Aires , to join him in Argentina . As early as 1874 , Berg began an expedition to Patagonia to collect specimens for the museum . This first collecting trip was followed by others through Argentina , also in Chile and Uruguay .   
 Apart from a period of two years from 1890 to 1892 , spent at the Museo Nacional in Montevideo , he was based in Buenos Aires . He replaced Burmeister as the head of the museum in 1892 .   
 His first specialty was entomology , but he was also dedicated to paleontology and the study of vertebrates . Amongst his many other achievements , he described Cactoblastis cactorum , the cactus moth .   
 Berg was a fellow of the Entomological Society of London and a corresponding member of the Zoological Society of London .

 = Emma Lehmer =   
Emma Markovna Lehmer ( née Trotskaia ) ( November 6 , 1906 – May 7 , 2007 ) was a mathematician known for her work on reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory . She preferred to deal with complex number fields and integers , rather than the more abstract aspects of the theory .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 She was born in Samara , Russian Empire , but her father 's job as a representative with a Russian sugar company moved the family to Harbin , China in 1910 . Emma was tutored at home until the age of 14 , when a school was opened locally . She managed to make her way to the USA for her higher education .   
 At UC Berkeley , she started out in engineering in 1924 , but found her niche in mathematics . One of her professors was Derrick N. Lehmer , the number theorist well known for his work on prime number tables and factorizations . While working for him at Berkeley finding pseudosquares , she met his son , her future husband Derrick H. Lehmer . Upon her graduation summa cum laude with a B.A . in Mathematics ( 1928 ) , Emma married the younger Lehmer . They moved to Brown University , where Emma received her M.Sc. , and Derrick his Ph.D. , both in 1930 . Emma did not obtain a Ph.D. herself . Most universities had nepotism rules which prevented husband and wife from both holding teaching positions , although Emma claimed there were many advantages to not holding a Ph.D .   
 The Lehmers had two children , Laura ( 1932 ) and Donald ( 1934 ) .   
    
    
 == Contributions ==   
 Lehmer did independent mathematical work , including a translation from Russian to English of Pontryagin 's book Topological Groups . She worked closely with her husband on many projects ; 21 of her 56 publications were joint work with him . Her publications were mainly in number theory and computation , with emphasis on reciprocity laws , special primes , and congruences .   
 Paul Halmos , in his book I want to be a mathematician : An automathography , wrote about Lehmer 's translation of Pontryagin 's Topological Groups : `` I read the English translation by Mrs. Lehmer ( usually referred to as Emma Lemma ) ... '' . Several later publications repeated Halmos ' reference to reinforce the significance of Lehmer 's translation .

 = Edward Gramlich =   
Edward M. Gramlich ( June 18 , 1939 – September 5 , 2007 ) was a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve .   
 Gramlich graduated from Williams College in 1961 and received a master 's degree in 1962 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1965 from Yale University . He joined the Federal Reserve as a research economist from 1965-1970 , and was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1973-1976 . He then taught economics and public policy at the University of Michigan from 1976 to 1997 , including a term as dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy , and returned to Michigan as a professor in 2005 .   
 He was appointed to the Federal Reserve System by President Bill Clinton in 1997 and resigned in August 2005 . For much of his term , he was the Chair of the Board 's Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs .   
 He was also the chairman of the Air Transportation Stabilization Board , which was created by Congress after the 9/11 attacks raised concerns about the survival of the U.S. airline industry . Gramlich had also chaired several other lesser-known stabilization boards created by Congress . In an April 2003 speech to the National Economists Club , he concluded that such boards are an ineffective way to help struggling industries because of the time it takes before help arrives and because the industries that are in need of help often have far deeper problems that the stabilization boards can not fix .   
 “ If Congress wants to bail out an industry in a hurry , it should bail it out . It takes time to act in this program , which means it 's probably not a good program for [ emergency ] scenarios ” , Gramlich told the club .   
 Gramlich was also formerly the chairman of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and was seen as an expert on subprime lending after his years as a banking regulator at the Federal Reserve .   
 Gramlich had other government experience as well , serving as chairman of the Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security from 1994 to 1996 and as deputy director , and then acting director , of the Congressional Budget Office in 1986-1987 . He also conducted research in 1992 on the economics of major league baseball and wrote a popular textbook on benefit-cost analysis that is in its second edition .   
 Gramlich highlighted the problems with subprime mortgages prior to the 2007-09 financial crisis . His book , `` Subprime Mortgages : America 's Latest Boom and Bust '' ( 2007 ) ISBN 978-0877667391 was published before the crisis was widely recognized and he had spoken out about them earlier .   
 Gramlich and his wife , Ruth had two children , Sarah and Robert , both married , and six grandchildren .

 = Amund Helland =   
Amund Helland ( 11 October 1846 – 15 November 1918 ) was a Norwegian geologist , politician and non-fiction writer . He is particularly known for his works on glacial erosion and the role of glaciers in the formation of valleys , fjords and lakes . He is also known for starting the series Norges Land og Folk , published in 20 volumes from 1885 to 1921 .   
    
    
 == Personal life ==   
 Helland was born in Bergen as the son of merchant Hans Helland ( 1817–1859 ) and Karen Marie Folkedal . He had six siblings . When his father died in 1859 , his mother earned to the family 's living by running a pension . He died in Kristiania in 1918 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Helland was a student from 1864 , and graduated as cand.min . in 1868 . In his early career he made excursions to Greenland , Iceland and other European countries . In his first work , the monography Ertsforekomster i Søndhordland og Forekomster af Kise i visse Skifere i Norge from 1871 , he claimed unconventional views which were not appreciated by elder colleagues . His pioneering works on glacial erosion and the role of glaciers in the formation of valleys , fjords and lakes , from the mid-1870s , have later become classics . His views on glacial erosion opposed the mainstream theories of the time , but have later been adopted in the geological sciences . He also suggested that the deposits on the North European Plain and the North Sea shelf originated from erosion of Scandinavian fjords . In 1878 he published a popular book on the structure of Earth , Om Jordklodens Bygning . From 1879 he lectured in mining operations , and he was appointed extraordinary professor in 1885 . He published a book on the Kongsberg Silver Mines , Kongsbergs sølværks drift før og nu , in 1885 , three volumes of a handbook of mining , Haandbog i grubedrift , in 1887. and Norsk bergret med udsigt over andre lands bergværkslovgivning from 1892 . His works on soils include Jordbunden i Norge from 1893 , Jordbunden i Jarlsberg og Larviks Amt from 1894 , and Jordbunden i Romsdals Amt from 1895 . Other geological works include Lakis kratere og lavastrømme from 1886 and Lofoten og Vesteraalen from 1897 . He initiated the monumental work Norges Land og Folk , a book series published from 1885 until after his death . He was a member of Nordlendingenes Forening and in 1912 he was awarded the Petter Dass Metal ( Petter Dass-medaljen ) .The mountain of Hellandfjellet at Prins Karls Forland , Svalbard , is named after him , as is the Helland Glacier of South Georgia .

 = Henri Begleiter =   
Henri Begleiter ( September 11 , 1935 in Nimes , France – April 6 , 2006 in Long Island , NY ) was a neurophysiologist and Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry   
 and Neuroscience at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn . He was a leader in the nascent field of biomedical alcohol research in the   
 1970s , postulating alcoholism as a brain disorder . He founded and headed the world-renowned Neurodynamics Laboratory at SUNY Downstate Medical   
 Center , Brooklyn , which has been renamed in 2007 into the 'Henri Begleiter Neurodynamics Laboratory ' .   
 The highlights of Begleiter ’ s career include the ground breaking finding published in Science that some neurophysiological anomalies in alcoholics were   
 already present in their young offspring before any exposure to alcohol and drugs . These seminal findings led Henri to propose a model that changed   
 the thinking in the field : namely , that rather than being a consequence of alcoholism , this underlying neural hyperexcitability was a predisposing   
 factor leading to the development of alcoholism and related disorders . This innovative study was replicated throughout the world and launched him on   
 a systematic search to elucidate the genetic vulnerability underlying a predisposition toward alcoholism and related disorders .   
 In 1990 , with his foresight and charismatic leadership , Henri Begleiter was instrumental in assembling scientists in various domains to organize the   
 large Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism — COGA , which he has led since its inception . Under his leadership , with a strong   
 emphasis on novel approaches such as using brain oscillations as endophenotypes , COGA has successfully identified several genes involved in the   
 predisposition to develop alcoholism and related disorders , and this approach is still state-of-the-art today .

Rudolf Spanner ( born 17 April 1895 in Metternich bei Koblenz ; died 31 August 1960 ) was Director of the Danzig Anatomical Institute during World War II . On his own initiative , he set up a process to produce soap from human fat in 1943-44 and a limited quantity of the soap was produced on his order to clean autopsy rooms.During the Nuremberg Trials , Sigmund Mazur , a laboratory assistant at the Danzig Anatomical Institute , testified that soap had been made from corpse fat , and claimed that 70 to 80 kg ( 154-176 lbs ) of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than 25 kg ( 55 lbs ) of soap , and that the finished soap was retained by Professor Rudolf Spanner . Eyewitnesses included British POWs who were part of the forced labor that constructed the camp , and Dr. Stanislaw Byczkowski , head of the Department of Toxicology at the Danzig School of Medicine . Suggested sources for the fat include Stutthof concentration camp , Danzig Municipal Jail , and a Danzig psychiatric hospital . The total of `` human soap '' produced by Rudolph Spanner is estimated at `` somewhere between 10 and 100 kilograms '' `` Aaron Breitbart , a senior researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center , agreed that the evidence is thin . 'The leading scholars of the Holocaust are of the opinion that the Nazis did not make soap , ' he says . 'It was a cruel rumor at the camps. ' '' . Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt , who investigated the subject , found little concrete documentation and no evidence of mass production of soap from human fat , but concluded that there was indeed evidence of experimental soap making .

 Johan Sems did not go to university himself . He had probably learned his skills in practice .   
 Little is known about his children .   
    
 TimelineIn 1599 , Sems became a silk merchant in Leeuwarden .   
 1600 : The book Practijck des lantmetens , a book written by Sems and Jan Pietersz . Dou , was published . The book was used at the engineering school started by Simon Stevin .   
 1602 : Sems was appointed land surveyor of Friesland .   
 1603 : Sems made a detailed map of Leeuwarden , which was engraved by Pieter Bast .

 1615 : Sems and Johan de la Haye determined the exact location of the border between Groningen and Drenthe , the Semslinie . They took the Martini tower as a reference point , but later measurements have shown that it would miss the Martini tower by 532 meters .   
 1616 : From April 30 Sems was involved in land reclamation at Bredstedt . Later that year he designed the Christianshavn on Amager .   
 1618 : On January 6 , while he was in Denmark , Sems was asked to come to the Netherlands because of a border dispute between Groningen and Drenthe . at Ter Apel .

 = Karl Christian Planck =   
Karl Christian Planck ( January 17 , 1819 – June 7 , 1880 ) was a German philosopher .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Planck was born in Stuttgart . He studied at Tübingen , where he became doctor of philosophy in 1840 and Privatdozent in 1848 . During this period the influence of Reiff led him to oppose the dominant Hegelianism of the time .   
 In 1850-1851 he published his great book , Die Weltalter , in which he developed a complete original system of philosophy , based on the realistic view that thought should proceed from nature to the highest forms of existence in the spiritual life . Not only did Planck oppose the idealism of his confreres ; his views were , in another aspect , directly antagonistic to the Darwinian theory of descent , which he specifically attacked in Wahrheit und Flachheit des Darwinismus ( Nördlingen , 1872 ) .   
 The natural consequence of this individuality of opinion was that his books were practically disregarded , and Planck was deeply incensed . The ill success of Die Weltalter nerved him to new efforts , and he repeated his views in Katechismus des Rechts ( 1852 ) , Grundlinien einer Wissenschaft der Natur ( 1864 ) , Seele und Geist ( 1871 ) , and numerous other books , which , however , met with no better fate . In the meantime he left Tübingen for Ulm , whence he came finally to the seminary of Maulbronn . He died in 1880 in an asylum after a short period of nervous prostration .   
 After his death a summary of his work came into the hands of K. Köstlin ( author of Aesthetics , 1869 ) , who published it in 1881 under the title Testament eines Deutschen , Philosophie der Natur und der Menschheit . Planck 's views were elaborately developed , but his method of exposition told heavily against their acceptance . He regarded himself as the Messiah of the German people .   
 Beside the works above quoted , he wrote System des reinen Idealismus ( 1851 ) ; Anthropologie und Psychologie auf naturwissenschaftlicher Grundlage ( 1874 ) ; a political treatise , Bismarck : Süddeutschland und der deutsche Nationalstaat ( 1872 ) ; and Logisches Causalgesetz und natürliche Zweckmäßigkeit ( 1874 ) .

 = Ethel Anson Peckham =   
Ethel Anson ( Steel ) Peckham ( 1879–1965 ) was an American horticulturist and botanical artist who bred plants that grow from bulbs and rhizomes such as iris and daffodil . She was a founding member and early director of the American Iris Society ( AIS ) , editor of its first major checklists , and author of its iris-judging rules . She bred iris herself and is credited with helping to introduce a new class , the miniature tall bearded iris . She is one of only a dozen people to have received the AIS Gold Medal , the society 's highest honor , and she was also awarded the Gold Medal of the British Iris Society for her paintings of iris .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Ethel Anson Steel was born in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , on November 30 , 1879 , to William White Garrigues Steel and Juliet ( Rauch ) Steel . She was educated at private schools in England.In 1906 , she married Wheeler Hazard Peckham , with whom she had two children , Content and Anson . They lived in New Rochelle , New York.In 1920 Peckham helped to establish both the American Iris Society and its first trial garden , which was located at the New York Botanical Garden ( NYBG ) . She continued to be involved with both organizations throughout her life . At NYBG , she was named honorary curator of both the iris and narcissus collections in 1927 . She was a contributor to the NYBG 's Journal and also to another of its publications , Addisonia.At the AIS , she held the post of director for a decade ( 1925–35 ) , during which period she also had charge of the AIS test gardens . She took over management of the AIS 's preliminary checklists and compiled and edited the monumental 1929 and 1939 lists , comprising 12,000 and 19,000 species , cultivars , and their synonyms , respectively . This was an important undertaking at the time , when irises were growing in popularity as American garden plants but their nomenclature was in disarray.Peckham also served to different times as the society 's registrar and its recorder , and she developed the AIS 's first set of rules for judging iris , thus making it possible for iris competitions to be held using nationally agreed standards.Peckham was one of the first breeders to carefully study dwarf irises and brought a thousand dwarf iris into the New York Botanical Garden . She is credited with helping to develop a new class , the miniature tall bearded irises , which she appreciated for their potential as cut flowers . She termed them 'table irises ' and provided the first description of the class . She introduced at least five new cultivars of intermediate bearded irises and at least 60 of tall bearded irises.She served for a time as the director of the Horticultural Society of New York.She also lectured around the country on horticultural topics and contributed to gardening magazines.She died February 23 , 1965 .   
    
    
 == Honors and legacy ==   
 In 1940 , Peckham became the third person to be awarded the AIS Gold Medal , and she remains one of only a dozen people ever to have received the society 's highest honor . She also received the Gold Medal of the British Iris Society for her paintings of beardless iris.In her honor , the Ethel Anson S. Peckham Award for Historic Iris was established in 2000 by the AIS.Some of Peckham 's paintings and copper engravings of irises are held by the American Iris Society . Her iris paintings are included in the 2006 book Classic Irises and the Men and Women Who Created Them.The New York Public Library holds a few of her papers as part of the Chesebrough-Peckeham Family Papers collection .

Kirk Bryan ( 22 July 1888 in Albuquerque , New Mexico – 22 August 1950 in Cody , Wyoming ) was an American geologist on the faculty of Harvard University from 1925 until his death in 1950 .   
 The son of R.W.D . Bryan ( Astronomer under Hall in the Polaris expedition ) , Bryan received his undergraduate education at the University of New Mexico and later obtained a Ph.D. from Yale University.A geomorphologist , he worked primarily in arid regions , and was one of the pioneers in explaining the forces that formed landmasses in those areas .   
 According to Luna Leopold , one of his students , Bryan was influential as a teacher . In 2004 , Leopold wrote :   
    
 His students made important advances in a variety of subjects , including alluvial chronology , periglacial and glacial geology , wind action , soil and vegetative effects on landscape development , and archaeology . His influence is indicated by the fact that of the four geologists who have received the National Medal of Science , three were students of Kirk Bryan .   
    
 The Geological Society of America 's Kirk Bryan Award is named in his honour . It is awarded annually in recognition of a publication of distinction advancing the science of geomorphology or Quaternary geology , which were Bryan 's areas of specialization .

Jean-Baptiste Bullet ( b. in Besançon , 1699 – d. 6 September 1775 ) was a French writer on philology and antiquities , and the author of Histoire de l'Établissement du Christianisme , a treaty of the existence of God demonstrated by nature in response to the problems evoked by unbelievers against various parts of the holy books . But he is best known for his memoirs of the Celtic language , his historical research on playing cards and his Dissertation on various topics in the history of France . It is in this last work that he argues that the word `` fleur de lys '' has no similarity with the royal insignia bearing the flower of the same name , but the word `` lis '' which in Celtic language would have meant `` sovereign king . ''   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was correspondent of the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Letters , royal professor of divinity , member of the academies of Lyon and Dijon , and dean of the University of Besançon , where he died in 1775 . Besides some theological productions , he wrote : Histoire de l ’ Établissement du Christianisme , taken solely from Jewish writers , Recherches Historiques sur les Cartes à Jouer and Dissertations sur différents sujets de l'histoire de France . But the reputation of Bullet is principally founded on his Mémoires sur la Langue Celtique , Besançon , 1754–1760 , a work which displays much more industry and learning than either taste or judgment .

 = Willy K C3 BCkenthal =   
Willy Georg Kükenthal ( August 4 , 1861 , Weißenfels – August 20 , 1922 , Berlin ) was a German zoologist . He was the older brother of botanist and theologian Georg Kükenthal ( 1864–1955 ) . Kükenthal specialized in the Octocorallia and on marine mammals . He edited , along with Thilo Krumbach , a landmark series of eight volumes in the Handbuch der Zoologie series which extensively reviewed and compiled the state of zoological knowledge of the time .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Kükenthal was born to August Kükenthal ( 1826-1910 ) and Minna Wimmer ( died 1917 ) and went to school at Weißenfels and Halle before joining the University of Munich where he studied mineralogy and later zoology at Jena , earning his doctorate at the latter institution in 1884 for studying lymphoid cells in annelids . He travelled around the North Sea with B. Weißenborn and joined the zoology department Jena under Ernst Haeckel in 1885 . In 1886 , with support from the Senckenberg Natural History Society , he participated in an expedition to Borneo and the Moluccas . He specialized in the study of Octocorallia , a taxonomic subclass that includes sea pens , sea fans and soft corals . In 1887 he obtained his habilitation , becoming a professor of phylogeny at Jena two years later . From 1898 he served as professor of comparative anatomy and zoology at the University of Breslau ( Wroclaw ) and as director of the zoological museum which in the present day is the Muzeum Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego ( `` Museum of the University of Wrocławskiego '' ) . In 1918 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Berlin as well as director of the zoological museum . In 1918-19 he was president of the German Zoological Society .   
    
 Kükenthal also traveled to regions in the Arctic in expeditions made in 1889 and travelled again to the Moluccas and Borneo in 1893-94 . He also conducted ethnographic studies . His large collection of zoological specimens is now housed at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt.Kükenthal was principally interested in comparative anatomy and conducted embryological and comparative anatomical investigations of whales and other marine mammals . He was a supporter of Haeckel 's biogenetic law . His other area of interest was the systematics of coelenterates and cnidaria . He published the Leitfaden für das Zoologische Praktikum ( 1898 ) and from 1913 he edited along with Thilo Krumbach the Handbuch der Zoologie.He has over twenty zoological species named after him , including Calamorhabdium kuekenthali ( Batjan iridescent snake ) , Emoia kuekenthali ( Kuekenthal 's emo skink ) , Hemirhamphodon kuekenthali ( Kuekenthal 's halfbeak ) , Parantica kuekenthali ( Kuekenthal 's yellow tiger ) , and Lysmata kuekenthali ( Kuekenthal 's cleaner shrimp ) .   
 Kükenthaløya , a small island located between Spitsbergen and Barentsøya is named in his honor .

 = Angelo Mosso =   
Angelo Mosso ( 30 May 1846 – 24 November 1910 ) is the 19th century Italian physiologist who invented the first neuroimaging technique ever , known as 'human circulation balance'.Mosso began by recording the pulsation of the human cortex in patients with skull defects following neurosurgical procedures . From his findings that these pulsations change during mental activity , he inferred that during mental activities blood flow increases to the brain . Remarkably , Mosso invented the 'human circulation balance ' , only recently rediscovered , to non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity also in healthy subjects : this is therefore regarded as the first neuroimaging technique ever , forerunner of the more refined techniques of FMRI , and PET.He was born in Turin , studied medicine there and in Florence , Leipzig , and Paris , and was appointed professor of pharmacology ( 1876 ) and professor of physiology ( 1879 ) at Turin . He invented various instruments to measure the pulse and experimented and wrote upon the variation in the volume of the pulse during sleep , mental activity , or emotion . In 1900–01 he visited the United States and embodied the results of his observations in Democrazia nella religione e nella scienza : studi sull ' America ( 1901 ) . In 1882 he founded with Emery the Archives Italiennes de Biologie , in which journal most of his essays appeared . Among his other works are :

 His first employment was as a surveyor on the South Eastern Railway which , in 1837 , led to Brunel giving him responsibility for the construction of a section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway . It was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track transition curves and introduced an   
 alternative design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley Bridge Junction , near Exeter . During this period he lived in Cullompton and was Vicar 's Warden at St Andrew 's Church from 1842 to 1844 . He organised , and paid a large amount to the rebuilding of the chancel and other restoration work . He also offered to pay to restore the nave if local people would pay 10 % of the cost but this offer was refused . On completion of the Bristol to Exeter line in 1844 he left the town.At Brunel 's invitation Froude turned his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the Institution of Naval Architects became influential in ship design . This led to a commission to identify the most efficient hull shape , which he was able to fulfil by reference to scale models : he established a formula ( now known as the Froude number ) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls . He built a sequence of 3 , 6 and ( shown in the picture ) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws ; Raven 's sharp prow followed the `` waveline '' theory of John Scott Russell , but Swan 's blunter profile proved to offer lower resistance . His experiments were vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a result the first ship test tank was built , at public expense , at his home in Torquay . Here he was able to combine mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still followed today.In 1877 , he was commissioned by the Admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines . He invented and built the world 's first water brake dynamometer , sometimes known as the hydraulic dynamometer , which led to the formation of Heenan & Froude Ltd in Birmingham.While on holiday as an official guest of the Royal Navy he died in Simonstown , South Africa , where he was buried with full naval honours .   
 He was the brother of James Anthony Froude , a historian , and Hurrell Froude , writer and priest . William was married to Catherine Henrietta Elizabeth Holdsworth , daughter of the Governor of Dartmouth Castle , mercantile magnate and member of Parliament Arthur Howe Holdsworth .

 = Katherine Esau =   
Katherine Esau ( 3 April 1898 – 4 June 1997 ) was a German-American botanist who received the National Medal of Science for her work on plant anatomy .   
    
    
 == Early life and education ==   
 Esau was born on April 3 , 1898 in Yekaterinoslav , Russian Empire ( now Dnipro , Ukraine ) to a family of Mennonites of German descent , so-called `` Russian Mennonites '' . She began studying agriculture in Moscow , but after a year her family was prompted by the Bolshevik Revolution to move to Germany where she completed her studies at the Agricultural College of Berlin . The Esau family moved to California in 1922 , where Esau worked for the Spreckels Sugar Company on sugar beet resistance to curly top virus . She resumed her education at the University of California , Davis , where she achieved her doctorate in 1931 , joined the faculty , and remained until her retirement at age 67 .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 Esau was a pioneering plant anatomist and her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for four decades . Her early work in plant anatomy focused on the effect of viruses on plants , specifically on plant tissue and development . Esau worked at the University of California , Davis as a teacher and later a professor of Botany . While teaching , she continued her research on viruses and specifically phloem , the food conducting tissue in plants . Her treatise , The Phloem , was published in 1969 as Volume 5 of the Hand-buch der Pflanzenanatomie . This volume has been recognized as the most important of this series and a definitive source of information about phloem . She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949 . In the 1950s , she collaborated with botanist Vernon Cheadle on more phloem research . In 1957 , she was the sixth woman elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences . In 1963 , she was promoted to full professor at Davis . After retiring from the University of California , Davis , she moved to the University of California , Santa Barbara in 1965 , and continued her research well into her 90s , publishing 162 articles and five books.When asked by Elga Wasserman to reflect on her education and career , Esau wrote in 1973 that scientific activities dominated her career and added , `` I found ways of maintaining spiritual independence while adjusting myself to established policies . . . . I have never felt that my career was being affected by the fact that I am a woman . ''   
    
    
 == Recognition ==   
 In 1989 , President George Bush awarded Esau the National Medal of Science.In memory of her contributions as a lecturer , author and scientist , the Katherine Esau Award is awarded to the graduate student who presents the best paper in structural and developmental biology at the annual meeting of the Botanical Society of America.Many of Esau 's publications are housed and available for loan from the Cornelius Herman Muller library at the University of California , Santa Barbara 's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration .   
 Esau died on 4 June 1997 in Santa Barbara , California , USA .

 = Albert R. Ellingwood =   
Albert Russell Ellingwood ( 22 June 1887 – 12 May 1934 ) was a pioneering mountaineer and climber in the western United States during the first half of the twentieth century . He made first ascents of many peaks and routes in the Rocky Mountains , particularly in Colorado , including Lizard Head in the San Juan Mountains , Ellingwood Ridge on La Plata Peak in the Sawatch Range , and Crestone Needle in the Sangre de Cristo Range . Many mountain features are named for him , on peaks such as Middle Teton , on which Ellingwood made the first ascent , the Ellingwood Ridge of La Plata Peak , and the Ellingwood Arete ascent of Crestone Needle ; the fourteener Ellingwood Point , near Blanca Peak in southern Colorado , is named for him as well.The brave pioneer of previously unattempted climbs died prematurely at the age of 46 . At that time he was assistant dean at Northwestern University . Ellingwood was a Rhodes Scholar and was a professor of political science at Colorado College . At the time of his death during a medical procedure , he was Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Northwestern University . Contrasting with the brevity of his life is the longevity of his climbing companion Eleanor Ehrman née Davis ( 1885-1993 ) . Their `` firsts '' in climbs included the aforementioned Crestone Needle 1916 and again by the arete in 1925 . In 1923 they made the first ascent of the South Teton as well the 3rd or 4th ascent of the Grand Teton .

 = William Alford Lloyd =   
William Alford Lloyd ( 1826–1880 ) was an English self-taught zoologist who became the first professional aquarist .   
 Inspired by Gosse 's new book , The Aquarium , published in 1854 Lloyd , who worked for a bookseller , began keeping marine animals in glass tanks . On 14 July 1855 he opened a shop advertised in Notes & Queries as “ selling everything relating to aquaria ” at 164 St John Street Road , Clerkenwell , London . In 1856 he opened a new shop “ The Aquarium Warehouse ” at 20 , Portland Road , Regent 's Park and in 1860 he supervised the installation of an aquarium The Gardens of the Society of Acclimatation in Bois de Boulogne in Paris .   
 By the 1860s the aquarium craze was over , at least in England , and Lloyd went bankrupt and in 1862 supported by Richard Owen he moved to Grindel Dammthor , Hamburg to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium.Success in Germany led to his appointment as Superintendent of the Crystal Palace Aquarium two years before it opened in 1871 . Anton Dohrn who had made Lloyd 's acquaintance in 1866 at the Hamburg aquarium invited him to install the aquaria at Stazione Zoologica at Naples in the spring of 1873 . Here some of Lloyd 's circulating system was still operating well into the 20th century . Anton Dohrn 's professional biological station flourished and the Swedish Professor Loven of Sweden , who planned a research establishment sent a representative to London to consult with Lloyd . In England Lloyd 's last post was as superintendent at the Aston Aquarium , Birmingham .

 = Agnes Bluhm =   
Agnes Bluhm ( 9 January 1862 – 12 November 1943 ) was a German winner of a Goethe medal . She was trained as a medical doctor and won prizes for her research . She believed that German women could improve the race using eugenics and forced sterilisation . She wrote that the `` female psyche '' made her gender predisposed towards working for `` racial hygiene '' .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Bluhm was born in Constantinople in 1862 . She was trained as a medical doctor and won prizes for her research . She believed that German women could improve the race using eugenics . While a student , she met Friedrich Nietzsche and became part of the students in his circle , which included Eva Corell , Meta von Salis , Resa von Schirnhofer and Clara Willdenow.In 1886 she fell in love with Alfred Ploetz who was already involved with another scientist named Pauline Rüdin . They became involved whilst conducting dissection and they decided to get married early in 1887 . Ploetz was also seeing an American named Mary Sherwood who was studying hypnotism . Ploetz returned to Rüdin in 1888 and married her . Bluhm however kept Ploetz as a close friend throughout her life and they both shared similar views on racial purity and the benefits of eugenics.Bluhm became the third female doctor in Berlin and she joined two fellow Zurich trained doctors to staff a clinic for poor women there in 1890 . She joined the Racial Hygiene Society in 1906.Bluhm had to retire from practising medicine due to problems with her ears but she redirected her efforts to medical research . After 1918 she conducted extensive research on heredity in animals to try to determine how a race could be improved . She is said to be first German female doctor known for her research . She carried out research on alcoholism and heredity under early funding from the Rockefeller Foundation . Bluhm was awarded a silver Leibnitz medal for her work.In 1936 she published her book which laid out her views on the role of women . The Racial Hygiene Problem for Women Physicians described how she saw women 's role to work hard at reproduction in order to improve humanity . She strongly advocated against smoking , noting research which showed lower fertility in women who smoked . Women should look to motherhood and not to emancipation as their contribution . Although Bluhm had a career she saw this as a special case because of the need for speciality doctors . In general she thought that women should not have careers . Moreover , she recommended that the `` female psyche '' made her gender predisposed towards working for `` racial hygiene '' .She won the Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft during the war . Adolf Hitler awarded about 400 of these medals during his time in power but only five were awarded to women and the rest were a singer , actresses and writers.Bluhm died in Beelitz in 1943 before the end of the Second World War ( Some say 1944 ) .

 = Dimitri Nalivkin =   
Dimitri Vasilievich Nalivkin ( 1889–1982 ) was a geologist from the Soviet Union . He was primarily interested in stratigraphy , but was also responsible in large part for mapping the geology of the USSR.The son of a mining engineer , Nalivkin was born in St. Petersburg in 1889 , and followed his father 's footsteps by entering the local Mining Academy in 1907 . During his training he began teaching there , and also became involved in fieldwork expeditions in the Caucasus and Central Asia . Early work dealt with Devonian brachiopods in the Kyrgyzstan portion of the Fergana Valley , and he retained an interest in this geological period throughout his career .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 He received the A. P. Karpinsky Distinguished Award in 1913 for one of his papers on faunal composition , and this provided him with the means to go to the Russian Biological Station in Villefranche ( France ) to study mollusks . By 1915 Nalivkin was considered an expert in central Asian geology . He was asked by the Russian Geographical Society to lead an expedition to study ancient glaciations in the Pamir . Their results of their study confirmed traces of two ancient glaciations , as well as producing a stratigraphic succession and the completion of a tectonic map . Nalivkin was awarded the Small Silver Medal of the Geographical Society in recognition of his leadership of the expedition . He was called to military service in 1917 , and following demobilisation in late 1917 , returned to his studies of Devonian fauna.In 1917 he was elected to the Geological Commission of Russia , and remained with it for more sixty years . During his tenure with the Commission he was responsible for directing research into palaeontology , sedimentology and stratigraphy , work which led to the development and extraction of resources such as coal , ores and petroleum .   
 He completed his doctorate in 1924 and was appointed a Professor at the Saint Petersburg Mining University . During World War II , his research extended to a search for bauxite as a means of assisting the war effort 's need for aircraft metals.His most significant contribution came with the creation of the index geological maps of the USSR ( and adjacent regions ) , which attracted considerable international attention . With the completion of his Geological Map of the USSR ( 1:2,500,000 scale ) he was awarded the prestigious Lenin Prize in 1957 .

 = Friedrich Bernhard Ferdinand Michelis =   
Friedrich Bernhard Ferdinand Michelis ( July 27 , 1815 – May 28 , 1886 ) was a German theologian and philosopher born in Münster .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He studied philosophy and theology at the Academy of Münster , receiving his ordination in 1838 . From 1845 he was a chaplain and school teacher in Duisburg , and later ( 1849–54 ) an instructor at the Episcopal Theological Institute in Paderborn . From 1855 to 1864 he served as pastor in Münster-Albachten , and from 1864 to 1872 was a professor of philosophy at the Lyceum in Braunsberg . In 1860 he participated in the Erfurt conference that would lead to Julie von Massow 's Ut Omnes Unum movement , which sought the reunification of Catholicism with Protestantism.In his writings , Michelis attempted to reconcile the teachings of Plato and those of modern science with the doctrines of Roman Catholicism . In 1866/7 , he was prominent in the Prussian Diet as an opponent of Otto von Bismarck 's ecclesiastical policy . But he also opposed the influence of the Jesuits and the dogma of papal infallibility in several pamphlets ( 1869–70 ) , which led to his excommunication.Michelis was a major figure in the `` Old Catholic '' movement in Germany , and from 1874 was associated with Old Catholic parish at Freiburg . As a philosopher he was an opponent of materialism , and an outspoken critic of Darwinism and Güntherianism . For a period of time , he was editor of the journal Natur und Offenbarung ( Nature and Epiphany ) . He also edited Der Katholik , an organ especially directed against the Jesuits .

 = Bernardino Drovetti =   
Bernardino Michele Maria Drovetti ( January 7 , 1776 – March 5 , 1852 ) was an Italian antiquities collector , diplomat , and politician . He is best remembered for having acquired the Turin Royal Canon and for his questionable behavior in collecting ancient Egyptian antiquities .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born in Barbania , a comune near Turin in the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia , Drovetti later obtained the French nationality and joined the Grande Armée . As an official , during the French campaign in Egypt ( 1798–99 ) he distinguished himself by saving the life of Joachim Murat , and later he became the French Consul-General of Egypt during both the Empire ( until 1814 ) and the Bourbon Restoration , between 1820 and 1829 . He also earned Wāli Muhammad Ali 's trust and had a role in some of the latter 's administrative reforms . In 1820 he was awarded the title of Chevalier dans l'Ordre de la Legion d'Honneur.During his stay in Egypt , Drovetti became a passionate and avid collector of Egyptian antiquities . He engaged several agents and was particularly active in Luxor ; shortly he gathered huge amounts of findings which he managed to sell in Europe . His first collection was refused by France , but was acquired by King Charles Felix of Sardinia in 1824 and carried to Turin , where it became the first core of the future Museo Egizio . Another collection was purchased by King Charles X of France and is now stored at the Louvre . A third one was acquired by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1836 and carried in Prussia in order of being accommodated in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin . Among the antiquities sold to the King of Sardinia there was the invaluable Turin Royal Canon , a papyrus bearing a list of several pharaohs which is datable to the reign of Ramesses II and which was found by Drovetti at Luxor in 1820 .   
 Later in his life , Drovetti lost his mind and was confined in a lunatic asylum at Turin . He died there in March 5 , 1852 .   
    
    
 == Legacy ==   
 While he contributed significantly to the creation of three of the largest Egyptological collections in Europe and substantially increased the European interest in ancient Egypt , Drovetti is also remembered for his ruthlessness towards other collectors and excavators . He was particularly hostile against Henry Salt , Giovanni Battista Belzoni and Jean-François Champollion : for example , during his excavations at Luxor around 1818 and later , Belzoni reported to have been harassed by two of Drovetti 's agents , Antonio Lebolo and a certain Rosignani ; Drovetti also tried several times to hinder Champollion 's expedition in Egypt ( 1827–28 ) , likely to prevent a competitor in his affairs . Drovetti and his agents were also deemed careless and unscrupulous in their conduct towards their discoveries , and it is believed that the fragmentary state of the Turin Royal Canon is at least partially due to this behavior .   
    
    
 == In popular culture ==   
 Drovetti was portrayed by Joseph Long in the 2005 BBC docudrama Egypt .

 = Moritz von Rohr =   
Moritz von Rohr ( 4 April 1868 – 20 June 1940 ) was an optical scientist at Carl Zeiss in Jena , Germany .   
 A street in Jena is named after him : Moritz-von-Rohr-Straße , near Carl-Zeiss-Promenade and Otto-Schott-Straße .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Moritz von Rohr was born in Lonzyn near Hohensalza , then part of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen , but now in Poland and known as Łążyn , near Inowrocław . He obtained a doctorate of philosophy at the University of Berlin in 1892 .   
    
    
 == Inventions ==   
 Von Rohr is usually credited with the design of the first aspheric lenses for eyeglasses . He invented the eyeglass lens designs that became the Zeiss Punktal lenses .   
 He also developed a method of computing depth of field from a camera 's entrance pupil location and diameter , without reference to focal length and f-number ( see his 1904 and 1906 books ) . He says , `` At this point it will be sufficient to note that all these formulae involve quantities relating exclusively to the entrance-pupil and its position with respect to the object-point , whereas the focal length of the transforming system does not enter into them . '' T. R. Dallmeyer refers to Von Rohr ’ s `` interpretation '' of depth of field in his 1899 book Telephotography .   
    
    
 == Publications ==   
 According to the Focal Encyclopedia of Photography ( 1965 ) , `` A bibliography of his 571 books and articles was published in Forschungen zur Geschichte der Optik , 1943 . ''   
 Von Rohr wrote several books on optics , optical instruments , and photographic lenses , in German .

 = Ludwig T C3 BCrck =   
Ludwig Türck ( 22 June 1810 – 25 February 1868 ) was an Austrian neurologist who was a native of Vienna .   
 In 1836 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna , where in 1864 he became a full professor .   
 He is remembered for his pioneer investigations of the central nervous system , particularly his studies involving nerve fiber localization , direction and degeneration . His name is lent to the `` bundle of Türck '' , which are uncrossed fibers forming a small bundle in the pyramidal tract . Today this bundle of fibers is usually called by its clinical name : the anterior corticospinal tract . In medical literature , the terms `` Türck 's bundle '' , `` Türck 's column '' and `` Türck 's tract '' are also used for the anterior corticospinal tract.During the latter part of the 1850s , Türck , along with physiologist Johann Nepomuk Czermak ( 1828-1873 ) were responsible for introducing the laryngoscope into medicine . Among Türck 's assistants and students in Vienna were laryngologists Karl Stoerk ( 1832-1899 ) , Leopold von Schrötter ( 1837-1908 ) and Johann Schnitzler ( 1835-1893 ) .

 = John Leonard Riddell =   
John Leonard Riddell ( February 20 , 1807 – October 7 , 1865 ) was a science lecturer , botanist , geologist , medical doctor , chemist , microscopist , numismatist , politician , and science fiction author in the United States . He was born in Leyden , Massachusetts , the son of John Riddell and Lephe Gates . He received his B.A . and M.A . at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from professor Amos Eaton and his M.D . from Cincinnati College in 1836 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Prior to receiving his M.D . Riddell found himself in Marietta , Ohio to study with Dr. Hildreth of Marietta College . As there were not many opportunities for a paid lecturer or a trained botanist he put out 'advertisements in local newspapers ' publicizing that he would collect plants for sale . He eventually published , in the Western Republican , one of the first botanical collections made in Ohio by a professional botanist . The specimens were donated to Marietta College and the Hildreth Herbarium . The collection was not adequately preserved and has been destroyed but the lists themselves remain.He lectured in Ogdensburg , New York , and then in Philadelphia and Cincinnati . From 1836 until his death in 1865 , he was Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of Louisiana ( now Tulane University ) in New Orleans . While there , he invented the first practical microscope to enable binocular viewing of objects through a single objective lens . In 1850 , he also undertook one of the earliest and most extensive American microscopic investigations of cholera.Riddell published a science fiction story giving an account of a fictional former student named Orrin Lindsay , who traveled to the moon and Mars.Following his botanical explorations of Texas , he was appointed melter and refiner of the New Orleans Mint , a position confirmed by President John Tyler following an internal mint dispute . He likewise was appointed Postmaster of New Orleans , which position he held even during the Civil War despite Confederate appointments intended to displace him.Active in local and state politics , he seems to have claimed to have been elected Governor of Louisiana in November , 1863 and sworn in by a justice of the peace in January , 1864 . During this time the military Governor George F. Shepley was still in actual power . His governorship was rejected in the course of a Congressional inquiry into a contested election in the House .

Alfred-Marie Liénard ( 2 April 1869 in Amiens – 29 April 1958 in Paris ) , was a French physicist and engineer . He is most well known for his derivation of the Liénard–Wiechert potentials .   
 From 1887–1889 Liénard was a student at the École Polytechnique and from 1889–1892 at the École des mines de Paris . From 1892–1895 he was a mining engineer in Valencia , Marseille , and Angers . From 1895–1908 he was professor at the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne and from 1908–1911 he was professor of electrical engineering at the École des Mines de Paris . In World War I he served in the French Army .   
 Liénard worked in the fields of electricity , magnetism , and mechanics . In 1898 ( and two years after him Emil Wiechert ) , he derived what is now called the Liénard–Wiechert potentials . He also investigated problems related to the elasticity and strength of materials , and wrote papers on thermodynamics and hydrodynamics .   
 Along with M. H. Chipart , Liénard developed the Liénard–Chipart criterion for determining the stability of a continuous-time system of equations .   
 Liénard was a commander of the Légion d'honneur . He was also vice-president of the Société Française des Électriciens and he was president of the Société Mathématique de France .

 For about ten years Concone resided in Paris as a teacher . Returning to Turin in 1848 , he was at the time of his death organist and choirmaster of the Court choir .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 He is widely known for his vocal exercises—solfeggi and vocalizzi—which are unusually attractive for works of their kind , and at the same time excellent for their special purpose . Thomaidis and MacPherson describe them as 'lively ' works in the Italian tradition of the time.While in Paris he wrote three 'oratorios ' , Smither : `` these are quite brief , include no orchestra but only piano accompaniment , and were evidently intended for performance in a private soiree rather than a theatre . No performance of any of the three is known . ''

 == Life ==   
 He was born in Oxford , the youngest son of Dr Humphry Sibthorp ( 1713–1797 ) , who , from 1747 to 1784 , was Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford.He graduated from Lincoln College , Oxford in 1777 , and then studied medicine at the Universities of Edinburgh and Montpellier . In 1784 , he succeeded his father to the Sherardian chair . Leaving his professional duties to a deputy , he left England for Göttingen and Vienna , in preparation for a botanical tour of Greece ( 1786 ) and Cyprus ( 1787 ) .Returning to England at the end of the following year , he took part in the foundation of the Linnean Society in 1788 , and set to work on a Flora of Oxfordshire , which was published in 1794 as Flora Oxoniensis . He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in Mar 1788.He made a second journey to Greece , but developed consumption on the way home and died in Bath on 8 February 1796 . He was buried at Bath Abbey.His will bequeathed his books on natural history and agriculture to the University of Oxford , and also founded Oxford 's Sibthorpian Professorship of Rural Economy ( subsequently titled the Sibthorpian Professorship of Plant Science ) . He directed that his endowment should first be applied to the publication of his Flora Graeca and Florae Graecae Prodromus , for which , however , he had done little beyond collecting some three thousand species and providing the plates . The task of preparing the works was undertaken by Sir J.E . Smith , who issued the two volumes of the Prodromus in 1806 and 1813 , and six volumes of the Flora Graeca between 1806 and 1828 . The seventh appeared in 1830 , after Smith 's death , and the remaining three were produced by John Lindley between 1833 and 1840 . The work 's first edition ran to a mere thirty copies and featured 966 colour plates ; a supplementary volume depicting wild flowers of Corfu was painted for Frederick North , 5th Earl of Guilford , and founder of the Ionian Academy , by G. Scola ( or Scala ) , a talented botanical illustrator.The standard botanical author abbreviation Sibth . is applied to species he described .

 He was born in Berlin , where he was educated in addition to Göttingen . In 1880 he was awarded his Ph.D. from Humboldt-Universität of Berlin with a dissertation titled , Über den Einfluss von Luftdruck und Wärme auf die Pendelbewegung ( On the influence of air pressure and heat on the movement of a pendulum ) .   
 In 1881 he joined the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam ( AOP ) as an assistant , and would remain there until he retired . His early career was spent on solar studies , including observations of sunspots and derivations of the rotation period . In 1897 he measured the parallax of 61 Cygni , a relatively nearby star .   
 He became an observer at the AOP in 1898 , and the following year he collaborated with Julius Scheiner in an unsuccessful attempt to measure the radio emission from the Sun . The same year he attempted to interpret the spectrum of novae . He performed extensive work on the luminosity , colors , and diameters of stars .   
 He retired in 1921 and died in Potsdam . The crater Wilsing on the Moon is named after him .

 His parents , Albert and Mary Henyey , were immigrants from Hungary . Louis George Henyey married Elizabeth Rose Belak , born in Budapest , on April 28 , 1934 ; they had three children : Thomas Louis , Francis Stephen , and Elizabeth Maryrose .   
 His undergrad ( 1932 ) and masters ( 1933 ) were from the Case School of Applied Science . In Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago he earned his doctorate in 1937 , with a mathematical thesis on the topic of reflection nebulae . In 1947 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Department of Astronomy at the University of California , Berkeley , and in 1954 he was promoted to professor . At Berkeley he became head of his own research group in the field of stellar evolution and supervised and collaborated with numerous graduate students , postdoctoral fellows , and scientific visitors . He died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 18 , 1970 .   
 He is best known for his two major scientific contributions in the field of stellar structure and evolution . First , he developed a method for automatic solution of the equations of stellar evolution , suitable for electronic computers and applicable to a wide range of physical conditions and phases in the lifetime of a star . Second , he made new calculation of the evolution of stars during their early history when gravitational contraction provides the main energy source , and during the transition phase when nuclear energy takes over from the gravitational source .   
 His work on the diffusion of the light in galaxies resulted in what is referred to as the Henyey-Greenstein phase function , first proposed in a paper he authored . This scattering model has found use in other scientific disciplines.The crater Henyey on the Moon is named after him , as is the asteroid called 1365 Henyey .

 =  C3 89tienne Laspeyres =   
Ernst Louis Étienne Laspeyres ( German : [ laˈspɛːɐ̯ ] ; 28 November 1834 – 4 August 1913 ) was a German economist . He was Professor ordinarius of economics and statistics or State Sciences and cameralistics ( public finance and administration ) in Basel , Riga , Dorpat ( now Tartu ) , Karlsruhe , and finally for 26 years in Gießen . Laspeyres was the scion of a Huguenot family of originally Gascon descent which had settled in Berlin in the 17th century , and he emphasised the Occitan pronunciation of his name as a link to his Gascon origins .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Laspeyres is mainly known today for his 1871 development of the index number formula method for determining price increases , used for calculating the rate of inflation . A type of this calculation is known today as the Laspeyres Index . In addition to his accomplishments in price indices , Laspeyres may be counted as one of the fathers of business administration as an academic-professional discipline in Germany , and as one of the main unifiers of economics and statistics by “ developing ideas which are today by and large nationally and internationally reality : quantification and operationalization of economics ; expansion of official statistics ; cooperation of official statistics and economic research ; and integration of the economist and the statistician in one person. ” ( Rinne 1983 ) In economics , Laspeyres was to some extent a representative of the Historical School and certainly of Kathedersozialismus .   
 The surname Laspeyres is of Gascon origin ; his ancestors were Huguenots who settled in Berlin in the 17th century . How he pronounced his surname is uncertain , but likely as `` Las-pay-ress '' .

 The accession of Henry IV of France , against whom he had written , and the assassination of de Guise in 1588 , necessitated his leaving France in 1591 , and he went to Rome , where he entered the service of the Curia . He was made a consultor of the Congregatio de Auxiliis , established in 1599 to settle the controversy on grace between the Dominicans and the Jesuits .   
 On its dissolution , in 1607 , he desired to return to France , but the pope , Pope Paul V , kept him in Rome .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 His chief work consisted of Animadversiones against twenty-five propositions of Molina , a Spanish Jesuit who had written a book on grace , defending the doctrines of Duns Scotus against those of the Dominicans . The Animadversiones were published by Antonio Raynaldo , the Dominican , in 1644 .

 = Jorge Reinel =   
Jorge Reinel ( c. 1502 – after 1572 ) born in Lisbon was a Portuguese cartographer and instructor in cartography , son of the well-known cartographer Pedro Reinel . In 1519 in Seville he participated in the maps designed for the trip of his countryman Ferdinand Magellan , and his depiction of the Maluku Islands served as a basis for Spanish claims to the islands . He had trained many pupils in the art of cartography such as Portuguese Diogo Ribeiro .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Son of expert Portuguese cartographer Pedro Reinel , he went to Spain after a fight with a priest named Pero Anes . There he participated in the preparations for the trip of his countryman Ferdinand Magellan and for this reason he was in Seville in 1519 . It was there that his father came seeking for him to return to Portugal , but Jorge could not return before finishing a map and a globe that he had undertaken to do , and so Pedro helped him .   
 The location of the Maluku Islands in these charts was the reason of the dispute between Portugal and Spain : Reinel maps were used to support the claims of the crown of Castile to the spice-producing Molucca Islands , claiming that the Islands were located in their domains by the Treaty of Tordesillas . He has also produced maps of the west coast of Africa , the North Atlantic , the South Atlantic . Scholars think that Reinel , after getting into trouble in Lisbon in the early 16th century and fleeing to Spain , made the first map of the world .   
 In Portugal , Jorge Reinel served king John III of Portugal as a master of charts and needles ( compass ) , having been granted an annual pension of 10 reais starting in 1528 .

 = Johann Friedrich (theologian) =   
Johann Friedrich ( May 5 , 1836 – August 19 , 1917 ) was a German theologian . He was prominent as a leader of the Old Catholics .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 He was born at Poxdorf in Upper Franconia , and was educated at Bamberg and at the University of Munich . He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1859 . In 1865 , he was appointed extraordinary professor of theology . In 1867 , he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences . He was a pupil of Ignaz von Döllinger.In 1869 he went to the Vatican Council as secretary to Cardinal Hohenlohe , and took an active part in opposing the dogma of papal infallibility , notably by supplying the opposition bishops with historical and theological material . He left Rome before the council closed .   
    
 `` No German ecclesiastic of his age appears to have won for himself so unusual a repute as a theologian and to have held so important a position , as the trusted counsellor of the leading German cardinal at the Vatican Council . The path was fairly open before him to the highest advancement in the Church of Rome , yet he deliberately sacrificed all such hopes and placed himself in the van of a hard and doubtful struggle '' ( The Guardian , 1872 , p. 1004 ) .A sentence of excommunication was passed on Friedrich in April 1871 , but he refused to acknowledge it and was upheld by the Bavarian government . He continued to perform ecclesiastical functions and maintained his academic position , becoming an ordinary professor in 1872 . In 1874 , he inaugurated the Old Catholic theological faculty at the University of Bern and lectured there for a year . In Bavaria , in 1882 , the Minister of Public Worship , yielding to ultramontane pressure , transferred him from his chair in theology to the philosophical faculty as professor of history . By this time he had to some extent withdrawn from the advanced position which he at first occupied in organizing the Old Catholic Church , for he was not in agreement with its abolition of enforced celibacy . He died in Munich .

Paula Hahn-Weinheimer ( * March 8 , 1917 in Nuremberg – † December 2 , 2002 in Munich ) was a German geochemist .   
 Paula Hahn-Weinheimer studied chemical engineering in Nuremberg and subsequently worked as a chemist for different companies . In 1943 she completed her studies at the Goethe University Frankfurt by obtaining a D.Sc . in organic chemistry . She then worked at the University of Giessen ’ s Institute for Organic Chemistry as well as at the Goethe University Frankfurt . As of 1948 she worked as a research assistant and lecturer at the Goethe University Frankfurt ’ s Department of Mineralogy where she obtained her official German postdoctoral qualification in geochemistry in 1958.In 1964 , Paula Hahn-Weinheimer accepted a post at the Technical University of Munich ( formerly known as THM ) where she was head of research for geochemistry at the Department of Mineralogy , initially as a scientific associate and , as of 1970 , as TUM ’ s first female associate professor ( C3 ) in the field of natural sciences . Liesel Beckmann had become the first female associate professor in the field of business economics in 1946 .   
 Her research areas ranged from the investigation into magmatic and metamorphic rocks in order to clarify their genesis and age to the determination of the origin of graphite and various types of petroleum . Research and scientific education was very important to her . Hence she managed to establish comprehensive chemical analyses of trace elements and isotopes by raising extensive third-party funds from the industry and federal government as well as through a partnership with the Department of Radiochemistry in Garching .   
 Paula Hahn-Weinheimer is the author of more than 50 scientific publications . She has made a lasting contribution by further developing the analysis of X-ray fluorescence and its application in geochemistry . Due to her expertise in this field she was invited to spend sabbatical leaves at international institutions including the University of Oxford and the University of Cape Town as well as the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center . In addition to the analysis of X-ray fluorescence , the excellent technical equipment of her department facilitated further analyses to determine elements and trace elements such as atomic absorption , mass spectrometry , optical emissions analysis , X-ray diffractometry , neutron activation analysis and the determination of isotopic abundance . A number of students took their doctorate under Paula Hahn-Weinheimer . One of her last students , Alfred V. Hirner ( a post-doctoral student at the time ) , was her interim successor at the TUM and later initiated the field of analytical chemistry at the University of Duisburg-Essen ( 1991 ) .   
 She was repeatedly featured in studies and exhibitions on the history of university education for women , especially with regard to the role women have played at technical universities in general and at the Technical University of Munich in particular .

In the 1950s and 1960s he exploited techniques developed by Alfred Kastler 's research group in Paris and demonstrated that radiation from a coherent superposition of excited states of atoms would display interference effects , known as 'quantum beats ' . A group of important papers on this subject brought Series international recognition.He accepted a chair at Reading University in 1968 , which he held until his retirement in 1982 . In 1972 Series was the William Evans Visiting Professor at the University of Otago ; in 1982 the Indian Academy of Sciences awarded him a Raman Visiting Professorship and he was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984.Series was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1971 , and of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1972 .

Young Khankhoje spent his childhood in Wardha , where he completed his primary and middle school education before moving to Nagpur for higher education . He was at the time inspired by the nationalist work of Bal Gangadhar Tilak . At some time in the first decade of the 1900s , Khankhoje left India on a voyage that ultimately saw him settle in the United States . Here he enrolled in the Washington State College ( now called Washington State University ) , graduating in 1913 .   
    
    
 == Indian independence activities ==   
 Khankhoje 's earliest nationalist work abroad dates back to the time around 1908 when he , along with Pandit Kanshi Ram founded the Indian Independence League in Portland , Oregon . His works also brought him close to other Indian nationalists in United States at the time , including Tarak Nath Das . In the years preceding World War I , Khankhoje was one of the founding members of the Pacific coast Hindustan association , and subsequently founded the Ghadar Party . He was at the time one of the most influential members of the party . He met Lala Har Dayal in 1911 . He also enrolled at one point in a West Coast military academy .   
    
    
 === Activities during World War I ===   
 Through World War I , Khankhoje was intricately involved in the Hindu–German Conspiracy when he was involved in the plans for the mutiny . He visited Europe during the war and subsequently went to Mesopotamia along with other members of what was the Berlin Committee . In the summer of 1915 , he worked clandestinely among troops of the Indian expeditionary force , spreading nationalist literature and hoping to incite a mutiny . Through the course of the war , Khankhoje made his way through Turkey and Persia under different Muslim guises as far as Baluchistan , spreading Ghadarite propaganda en route . He is known to have attempted insurrections and raised at the Iran-Baluchistan border while Mahendra Pratap 's Indo-German expedition attempted to rally the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan against British India . Towards the end of the war , Khankhoje , like most of the members of the Berlin committee , began turning towards communism . He is known to have been in Soviet Union in company of the earliest Indian communist , including Virendranath Chattopadhyaya , M. P. T. Acharya , M. N. Roy , Abdur Rab Barq . He met Lenin at Moscow in 1921 . For his nationalist work at the time , Khankhoje was banned from returning to India as a highly dangerous individual .   
    
    
 == Academic career ==   
 Khankhoje later moved to Mexico in the 1920s , where he was the professor of Botany and Crop Breeding in the National School of Agriculture of Mexico . In 1936 , Khankhoje married Jean Alexandrine Sindic , a Belgian woman in Mexico by whom he had two daughters . He led the Mexican corn breeding programme and was appointed director to the Mexican Government 's department of Agriculture .   
    
    
 == Return to India and later years ==   
 Both Pandurang and Jean returned to India after 1947 . His application for visa was initially rejected by the Indian government due to the ban by the British Indian Government , but was eventually overturned . He settled in Nagpur and subsequently embarked on a political career . Pandurang Khankhoje died on 22 January 1967 .

 = Friedrich Gottlob Hayne =   
Friedrich Gottlob Hayne ( 18 March 1763 , Jüterbog – 24 April 1832 , Berlin ) was a German botanist , taxonomist , pharmacist and professor.Hayne showed an early interest in the plant world . From 1778 until 1796 he worked as a pharmacist in Berlin , and was acquainted with the botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow of about the same age , who at the time was also a pharmacist in Berlin . From 1797 he worked on botanical and technical commissions for the factories department of the Prussian government .   
 From 1801 to 1808 he worked in Schönebeck on the Elbe , where he was an assistant in the `` Royal Prussian Chemical Factory '' ( later named 'Hermania ' ) , which was founded in 1793 by pharmacist Carl Hermann Samuel and was the first German chemical factory . During his stay in Schönebeck he studied the chemical composition of plants and collected the flora of the region .   
 After the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 , the Kingdom of Prussia lost about half of its territory , including all territory west of the Elbe . This prompted Hayne to return to Berlin in 1808 . From 1811 he taught at the University of Berlin as a lecturer in botany , and in 1814 he was appointed extraordinary professor . After many years of teaching , he was appointed Professor of Pharmaceutical Botany in 1828 . In addition to his lecturing duties he led many botanical excursions . He was known for using precise terminology in his plant descriptions .   
 Stretching over a period of some 30 years , Hayne produced 13 volumes of `` Getreue Darstellung und Beschreibung der in der Arzneykunde gebräuchlichen Gewächse '' each with 48 copper engravings of pharmaceutically interesting plants , mostly done by Friedrich Guimpel and Peter Haas . Hayne was an honorary member of the Berlin Society of Friends of Natural Science .

 = Pasquier Quesnel =   
Pasquier Quesnel ( 14 July 1634 – 2 December 1719 ) was a French Jansenist theologian .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born in Paris , and , after graduating from the Sorbonne with distinction in 1653 , he joined the French Oratory in 1657 . There he soon became prominent ; he took a leading part in scholarly controversy , for example against Joseph Anthelmi.His Jansenist sympathies led to his banishment from Paris in 1681 , following the formulary controversy . He took refuge with the friendly Cardinal Coislin , bishop of Orléans ; four years later , however , foreseeing that a fresh storm of persecution was about to burst , he fled to Brussels , and took up his abode with Antoine Arnauld .   
 There he remained till 1703 , when he was arrested by order of the archbishop of Mechelen . After three months imprisonment he made a highly dramatic escape , and settled at Amsterdam , where he spent the remainder of his life . After Antoine Arnauld 's death in 1694 Quesnel was generally regarded as the leader of the Jansenist party ; and his Réflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament played almost as large a part in its literature as Jansen 's Augustinus itself .   
 As its title betokens , Quesnel 's book was a devotional commentary on the New Testament , wherein Quesnel managed to explain the aims and ideals of the Jansenist party better than any earlier writer had done ; and it accordingly became the chief object of Jesuit attack . It appeared in many forms and under various titles , the original germ going back so far as 1668 ; the first complete edition was published in 1692 . The papal bull Unigenitus , in which no fewer than 101 sentences from the Réflexions morales were condemned as heretical , was obtained from Clement XI on 8 September 1713 . Quesnel died at Amsterdam in 1719 .   
 Unigenitus marked the end of Catholic toleration of Jansenist doctrine . The bull Unigenitus , dated 8 September 1713 , was produced with the contribution of Gregorio Selleri , a lector at the College of Saint Thomas , the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum , fostered the condemnation of Jansenism by condemning 101 propositions from the Réflexions morales of Quesnel as heretical , and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of Jansen .

 = August Kundt =   
August Adolf Eduard Eberhard Kundt ( German pronunciation : [ ˈaʊɡʊst ˈkʊnt ] ; 18 November 1839 – 21 May 1894 ) was a German physicist .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Kundt was born at Schwerin in Mecklenburg . He began his scientific studies at Leipzig , but afterwards went to Berlin University . At first he devoted himself to astronomy , but coming under the influence of H. G. Magnus , he turned his attention to physics , and graduated in 1864 with a thesis on the depolarization of light.In 1867 he became privatdozent in Berlin University , and in the following year was chosen professor of physics at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich , where he was the teacher of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen ; then , after a year or two at Würzburg , he was called in 1872 to Strasbourg , where he took a great part in the organization of the new university , and was largely concerned in the erection of the Physical Institute . Finally in 1888 he went to Berlin as successor to Hermann von Helmholtz in the chair of experimental physics and directorship of the Berlin Physical Institute . He died after a protracted illness at Israelsdorf , near Lübeck , on 21 May 1894 .   
    
    
 == Assessment ==   
 As an original worker , Kundt was especially successful in the domains of sound and light . In 1866 , he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes , based on the fact that a finely divided powder , lycopodium for example , when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air , tends to collect in heaps at the nodes , the distance between which can thus be ascertained . An extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases . This experimental apparatus is called a Kundt 's Tube . In 1876 at Strasbourg in collaboration with Emil Warburg , Kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas . In light , Kundt 's name is widely known for his inquiries in anomalous dispersion , not only in liquids and vapours , but even in metals , which he obtained in very thin films by means of a laborious process of electrolytic deposition upon platinized glass . He also carried out many experiments in magneto-optics , and succeeded in showing what Faraday had failed to detect , the rotation under the influence of magnetic force of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.Very interesting work was performed by Kundt on plant physiology and chlorophyll light frequencies absorption ( Kundt 's rule ) , centred on wavelengths of 6800 Å . This work may or may not have been complementary to E. Warburg work and theories . It was subsequently refined and expanded by R. Houston and O. Biermacher and others .

 = Kosta Tau C5 A1anovi C4 87 =   
Kosta Taušanović ( Aleksinac , May 4 , 1854 – Rijeka , January 26 , 1902 ) was a Serbian politician , minister and banker . He studied agriculture in Tábor ( then in Austria-Hungary , today in the Czech Republic ) and commerce in Hohenheim ( Germany ) . Taušanović was a prominent member of the People 's Radical Party , among its founding members and one of the closest collaborators of its leader Nikola Pašić . A Russophile , and an opponent of the Obrenović dynasty , Taušanović was persecuted by the Royal government on several occasions . After the Timok Rebellion ( 1883 ) he was , along with many other Radical leaders , sentenced to eight years in prison , but was pardoned in early 1886 . He was a negotiator of the Liberal-Radical Coalition of 1886 . He was again in trouble with the authorities due to his Radical affiliation after the assassination attempt against ex-King Milan Obrenović ( 1889 ) , as well as during the so-called Čebinac affair ( 1894 ) .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 A Radical deputy in the Serbian Parliament ( 1880-1883 ) , serving as a chairman of the Great Constitutional Assembly , he was one of the key figures in the process of the adoption of the highly liberal 1888 constitution of Serbia . Besides being a deputy in the Serbian parliament , Taušanović was , after the abdication of King Milan Obrenović , a Minister in several governments ( Minister of Interior 1889-1891 in Grujić 's cabinet , Minister of Economy 1891-1892 in Pašić 's Cabinet ) , and founder of the first insurance company in Serbia , as well as the Serbian Lottery ( Srpska Lutrija ) and the Serbian Shipping Company ( Srpsko Brodarsko Drustvo ) . In 1895 he was instrumental in founding the Serbian Bank ( Srpska banka ) in Zagreb , Austria-Hungary . As Minister of Interior he was criticized for not acting strongly against attacks by a mob on the members of the Progressive party in the streets of Serbian cities in May 1889 . He was elected president of the Serbian Society of Journalists in 1899 . Jointly with another prominent Radical leader , Jovan Đaja , Kosta Taušanović launched the Narod ( The People ) daily . In the mid-1890s , he distanced himself from Pašić and formed a separate faction within the National Radical Party . In 1899 , sentenced for alleged participation in the assassination attempt against ex-king Milan , Taušanović was sentenced to nine years in prison only to be pardoned again in 1900 .

 Taušanović was considered one of the most entrepreneurial Serbian politicians , an expert for both the banking and insurance system . He was highly successful in business , serving as chairman of Beogradska zadruga , Trgovačka zadruga and Izvozna Banka . In Beogradska zadruga ( Belgrade Co-op ) he founded the first Serbian insurance society ; in Trgovačka zadruga ( Merchant Co-op ) , he redirected their business into export of livestock ; at Izvozna banka ( Export Bank ) he contributed greatly to the company 's establishment as a serious enterprise . Only in Ottoman-held Macedonia did Taušanović 's attempt to establish financial institutions not provide expected results .   
    
 His friends and admirers erected a monument of him at the entrance of the Kalemegdan Park ( formerly the city fortress ) in downtown Belgrade .

 = Lansdown Guilding =   
The Reverend Lansdown Guilding ( 9 May 1797 – 22 October 1831 ) was a theologian and early naturalist . He was born on 9 May 1797 in Kingstown , St Vincent and the Grenadines . He was one of six siblings , son of the Reverend John Guilding and his wife Sarah . He is best known for his works on the flora and fauna of St Vincent in particular and on the Caribbean in general . He wrote numerous illustrated papers for journals of scholarly societies in England   
    
 In 1802 , at the age of 5 , he was sent to England , where he studied at Oxford University . In 1817 , after receiving a B.A . degree , he returned to his home country . His father died in 1818 , and he took up work as garrison chaplain and left for England in 1819.In 1818 , he was accepted as Fellow of the Linnean Society , and by 1820 he was corresponding with Joseph Dalton Hooker , Aylmer Bourke Lambert and other established scientists . Hooker wrote that Guilding was `` an arrogant , demanding , ambitious , and often conceited individual , all too ready to ask for unusual favors '' .In 1821 , he travelled to England to marry Mary Hunt , daughter of the Rev . S. Hunt , rector of Wakerly and St. George 's Church , Stamford.His first zoological paper was read at the Linnean Society and published in 1822 . Guilding was a capable artist of plants and animals drawings . He prided himself on the accuracy of his work and his use of color . When his work was redrawn he criticized both the artist and the engraver.From 1824 to 1826 he held a dispute with Robert Herries for the right to payment for paupers ' funerals . Herries claimed that Guilding had expunged the minutes of some meetings to change the vote of a vestry election , causing Herries to lose his position . Guilding stated that it was `` just a misunderstanding ” .His book “ An Account of the Botanic Gardens of the Island of St. Vincent ” was published in Glasgow in 1825 . Guilding was an excellent artist and engraver and he produced a `` Table of Colours Arranged for Naturalists '' in 1825 which may have been the first biological colour chart . This production was submitted to the Wernerian Natural History Society , where it was presented by the president , Professor Robert JamesonIn 1825 , he corresponded with Charles Darwin , providing him with notes on the natural history of the Caribbean region.In 1826 , he published the first description of a member of the phylum Onychophora . He found this specimen of velvet worm amongst plants collected in Trinidad . He thought it was an unusual type of slug , and included it along with his Caribbean mollusks . He named this genus Peripatus ( 1826 ) . He included an excellent watercolor painting of the specimen , and a mention to the defensive mechanism of sticky liquid squirts , leaving no doubt it was an onychophoran .   
 His wife died `` in childbed ” on November 15 , 1827 , leaving five children behind . A year later he married Charlotte Lydia Melville , of St. George 's , Grenada . In 1831 he went on vacation to Bermuda , where he died on October 22 . The cause of death was not recorded .   
 Guilding 's announced `` Fauna '' and `` Pomona occidentalis '' were never completed . The manuscripts were lost , together with his table of colors .

 = Waldemar Christofer Br C3 B8gger (geologist) =   
Waldemar Christofer Brøgger FRSE ( 10 November 1851 – 17 February 1940 ) was a Norwegian geologist and mineralogist . His research on Permian igneous rocks ( 286 to 245 million years ago ) of the Oslo district greatly advanced petrologic theory on the formation of rocks .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 He was born and died in Oslo , Norway , then called Christiania . He attended the Cathedral School in Oslo before studying at Oslo University.He was professor of mineralogy and geology from 1881 to 1890 in the University of Stockholm , and from 1890 to 1916 was Professor of Mineralogy and Palaeontology in the University of Christiania . He also became rector and president of the senate of the royal university of Christiania .   
 His observations on the igneous rocks of South Tyrol compared with those of Christiania afford much information on the relations of the granitic and basic rocks . The subject of the differentiation of rock-types in the process of solidification as plutonic or volcanic rocks from a particular magma received much attention from him . He dealt also with the Palaeozoic rocks of Norway , and with the late glacial and post-glacial changes of sea level in the Christiania region.He is credited for proposing that pegmatites form through the interaction of silicate melt and supercritical water . Credit for this discovery is often given to Richard H. Jahns.He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1890 and a fellow of the Royal Society .   
 The honorary degree of Ph.D. was conferred upon him by the University of Heidelberg and that of LL.D . by the University of Glasgow in 1901 . He was awarded the Murchison Medal in 1891 and the Wollaston Medal in 1911 , both by the Geological Society of London .

 = Eric Lenneberg =   
Eric Heinz Lenneberg ( 19 September 1921 – 31 May 1975 ) was a linguist and neurologist who pioneered ideas on language acquisition and cognitive psychology , particularly in terms of the concept of innateness .   
 He was born in Düsseldorf , Germany . Ethnically Jewish , he left Nazi Germany because of rising Nazi persecution . He initially fled to Brazil with his family and then to the United States where he attended the University of Chicago and Harvard University . A professor of psychology and neurobiology , he taught at the Harvard Medical School , the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Cornell University and Medical School .   
 Lenneberg 's 1964 paper `` The Capacity of Language Acquisition , '' originally published in 1960 , sets forth seminal arguments about the human-specific biological capacity for language , which were then being developed in his research and discussions with George A. Miller , Noam Chomsky , and others at Harvard and MIT , and popularized by Steven Pinker in his book , The Language Instinct . He presents four arguments for biological innateness of psychological capacities , parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits :   
    
 Universal appearance of a trait at a single time across a species . `` Species typical '' traits .   
 Universal appearance across time for a group . Not just an artifact of cultural history . Again , `` species typical '' diagnostic feature .   
 No learning of the trait is possible .   
 Individual development of a trait rigidly follows a given schedule regardless of the particular experience of the organism.In his publication Biological Foundations of Language he advanced the hypothesis of a critical period for language development ; a topic which remains controversial and the subject of debate . Lenneberg 's biological approach to language was related to developments such as the motor theory of speech perception developed by Alvin Liberman and colleagues at Haskins Laboratories and also provided historical antecedents to issues now emerging in embodied philosophy and embodied cognition .   
 Lenneberg reargued extensively against the psychological implications of the work of Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf , specifically in regards to the idea that language influences thought . Lenneberg 's argument against this notion was that 'linguistic and non-linguistic events must be separately observed and described before they can be correlated . '   
    
    
 == Affiliations ==   
 Lenneberg was quite involved in the scientific community , as he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa , Sigma Xi , the Linguistic Society of America , the American Psychological Association , the Society for Research in Child Development , and the American Association for the Advancement of Science .   
    
    
 == Education ==   
 He attended primary school in Düsseldorf , Germany until 1933 , when he moved to Brazil . In 1949 , he received a B.A . from the University of Chicago . Lenneberg then went on to earn a Ph.D. in Psychology and Linguistics from Harvard in 1956 .

 = William Reed Huntington =   
William Reed Huntington ( September 20 , 1838 – July 26 , 1909 ) was an American Episcopal priest and author .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Huntington was born in Lowell , Massachusetts . He graduated from Harvard in 1859 and in 1859–1860 was an instructor in chemistry there . Entering the Episcopal ministry , he was rector of All Saints Church , Worcester , Massachusetts , in 1862–1883 and of Grace Church , New York from 1883 until his death . Huntington always took a prominent part in public affairs . He was active in the movement for liturgical revisions and was secretary of the Prayer-Book Revisions Committee , and editor with Samuel Hart of the Standard Prayer-Book of 1892 . Huntington died in Nahant , Massachusetts , in 1909 . Huntington was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1875 .   
    
    
 == Works ==   
 The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral had its genesis in an 1870 essay by Huntington . In The Church Idea , an Essay toward Unity Huntington 's goal was to establish `` a basis on which approach may be by God 's blessing , made toward Home Reunion , '' i.e. , with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches . The Quadrilateral is a four-point articulation of Anglican identity , often cited as encapsulating the fundamentals of the Communion 's doctrine and as a reference-point for ecumenical discussion with other Christian denominations . The four points are :   
    
 The Holy Scriptures , as containing all things necessary to salvation ;   
 The Creeds ( specifically , the Apostles ' and Nicene Creeds ) , as the sufficient statement of Christian faith ;   
 The dominical sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion ;   
 The historic episcopate , locally adapted.The Quadrilateral has had a significant impact on Anglican identity since its passage by the Lambeth Conference . The Resolution came at a time of rapid expansion of the Anglican Communion , primarily in the territories of the British Empire . As such , it provided a basis for a shared ethos , one that became increasingly important as colonial churches influenced by British culture and values , evolved into national ones influenced by local norms .   
 Huntington also wrote :   
    
 Conditional Immortality ( 1878 )

John Thibaut ( 1917–1986 ) was a social psychologist , one of the last graduate students of Kurt Lewin . He spent a number of years as a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , and was the first editor of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .   
    
    
 == Life and work ==   
 The research group which he headed at UNC was regularly attended by Harry Upshaw , Jack Brehm , Kurt Back , and Edward E. Jones . He is best known for `` A Social Psychology of Groups '' , co-authored by his long-time collaborator Harold Kelley .   
 The examination of social exchange led Thibaut and Kelley to develop social exchange theory , a process which was facilitated by Thibaut spending a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences where he had significant interaction with Kenneth Arrow .   
 The early variations of Social Exchange Theory stem from Alvin Ward Gouldner 's ( 1960 ) norm of reciprocity , which argues that people ought to return benefits given to them in a relationship . Peter M. Blau built on the work done by George C. Homans in Exchange and Power in Social Life ( 1964 ) . Later modifications to this theory focus attention on relational development and maintenance rules ( see Murstein et al . ) .   
 Thibaut 's later research was in the area of procedural justice , where he co-authored a book with legal expert Laurens Walker .

 = Johann Christian Ruberg =   
Johann Christian Ruberg ( baptized 4 September 1746 – 5 September 1807 ) was a German inventor and a pioneer in metallurgy.About 1798 , Ruberg devised the first large-scale method for the production of zinc . This method ( so-called `` Silesian method '' ) , used horizontal muffle furnaces which permitted for continuous operation , i.e. , loading the input and unloading the product without cooling . This greatly improved the energy economy and labour intensity of the process . It subsequently led to the development of large zinc manufacturing industry in Silesia . Ruberg also authored several inventions and optimizations in glass-making .   
 Ruberg is buried at the Lutheran parish church cemetery in Lędziny , where a memorial to him was installed in 1998 . In 2000 , an elementary school at Lędziny ( Szkola Podstawowa No 3 ) received his name .

 == Bibliography ==   
 Packe had a heated controversy with Dr. John Gray of Canterbury respecting the treatment of Robert Worger of Hinxhill , Kent , who died of concussion of the brain , caused by a fall from his horse . The relatives , not satisfied with Packe 's treatment , called in Gray and two surgeons , who , Packe alleged in letters in the `` Canterbury News-Letter '' of 8 and 15 October 1726 , killed the patient by excessive bleeding and trepanning . He further defended himself in A Reply to Dr. Gray 's three Answers to a written Paper , entitled Mr. Worger 's Case , 4to , Canterbury , 1727.Packe wrote also :   
    
 A Dissertation upon the Surface of the Earth , as delineated in a specimen of a Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East Kent , 4to , London , 1737 . The essay had been read before the Royal Society on 25 November 1736 , and the specimen chart submitted to them .   
 ANKOΓΡAΦIA ( sic ) , sive Convallium Descriptio , an explanation of a new philosophico-chorographical chart of East Kent , 4to , Canterbury , 1743 . The chart itself , containing a `` graphical delineation of the country fifteen or sixteen miles round Canterbury , '' was published by a guinea subscription in 1743 . This is the world 's first geomorphological map : to make it Packe measured heights above sea level with a sophisticated barometer , as well as using an adapted theodolite mounted on top of the main tower of Canterbury Cathedral .   
 His letters to Sir Hans Sloane , extending from 1737 to 1741 , are in the British Museum , Additional ( Sloane ) MS. 4055 .

 = Karl Davydov =   
Karl Yulievich Davidov ( Russian : Карл Юльевич Давидов ; 15 March [ O.S . 3 March ] 1838 – 26 February [ O.S . 14 February ] 1889 ) was a Russian cellist of great renown during his time , and described by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as the `` czar of cellists '' . He was also a composer , mainly for the cello .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Davidov was the son of a physician from Courland Governorate . His elder brother August Davidov was a noted mathematician and educator , and his nephew Alexei Davidov also became cellist and composer and also a businessman .   
 In his youth Davidov studied mathematics at Moscow State University , and then pursued a career as a composer , studying with Moritz Hauptmann at the Leipzig Conservatory . He became a full-time cellist in 1850 while continuing to compose in his spare time . He later became head of the St Petersburg Conservatory . He had many students , including Aleksandr Verzhbilovich .   
 In 1870 Count Wilhorsky , a patron of the arts , presented Davydov with a Stradivarius cello constructed in 1712 . This cello , now known as the Davidov Stradivarius , was owned by Jacqueline du Pré until her death and is currently on loan to cellist Yo-Yo Ma .   
 He intended to write an opera on the subject of Mazeppa . Viktor Burenin wrote a libretto for this purpose in 1880 , but when Davidov proved unable to find the time to compose , Burenin offered the libretto to Tchaikovsky .   
 Although closely associated with Tchaikovsky , Karl Davidov was not related to the Davydov clan into which Tchaikovsky 's sister Alexandra married . Davidov died in Moscow on 26 February 1889 . Anton Arensky dedicated his first piano trio to Davydov 's memory .

 = George Madeira =   
George David Madeira ( October 1836 – January 1922 ) was a mining engineer and mineralogist who founded the first astronomical observatory in California in the town of Volcano .   
 Madeira arrived with his family from Illinois in Volcano on August 30 , 1852 . They , like many others , had come in search of gold during the California Gold Rush . He had been interested in astronomy as a child , reporting to have observed a comet in February , 1843 . Although his formal education had ended at age 15 , he continued to study mathematics from a neighbor , a Methodist minister from British Columbia named Telerand .   
 In 1860 , he set up a crude observatory consisting of his telescope ( which he had delivered from San Francisco ) , and a heavy canvas and oilcloth covering . On October 18 of that year , the Sacramento Daily Union published a letter from him ( under a pseudonym ) regarding sunspot activity , the earliest recorded publication of astronomical research in California . On June 30 , 1861 , he observed a large and bright comet , which was later dubbed the Great Comet of 1861 ( unbeknownst to him , it had already been discovered by Australian John Tebbutt over a month earlier , but news of the discovery had not reached the northern hemisphere yet ) . The family left Volcano for Carson City , Nevada in 1862 and Madeira sold his telescope to Josiah Whitney of the California Geological Survey .   
 In addition to his recorded observations , Madeira made another important contribution to astronomy . He was a paid lecturer even as a young man , taking his telescope around the state . After one such lecture in 1860 in San Jose attended by James Lick , he and Lick spent the next few nights observing the skies at Lick 's estate . At one point , Madeira told Lick , `` If I had your wealth , Mr. Lick , I 'd build the world 's largest telescope on top of that mountain , '' pointing out a spot where the present Lick Observatory sits . Although he was not the only influence , he was probably the first to suggest to Lick the idea of a large telescope .   
 Madeira went on to a varied career as a mining geologist , mineralogist ( he was Curator of the California mineral exhibit at the 1904 World 's Fair in St. Louis , Missouri ) , journalist , prospector , and mining consultant . He never lost his interest in astronomy and he wrote many articles on aspects of astronomy for the newspapers he worked at . At one point , he applied for a position at Lick Observatory when it opened , but in this he was not successful .

Miguel Kast Rist ( December 18 , 1948 - September 18 , 1983 ) was a German-born Chilean economist of the Chicago Boys group . He was most known for his role in public policies , where he promoted a greater focus of resources toward the needy.Upon getting his Master in Economics at University of Chicago , Miguel Kast joined Odeplan ( 1973 ) , the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973 . At Odeplan , Miguel Kast focused most of his energies on creating the `` map of extreme poverty '' , which would become the cornerstone of Chile 's social development programs . In 1978 he became the head of Odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join Odeplan and by sending them to the country 's outer regions to get insight into the real problems of Chile .   
 In 1980 Miguel Kast became Labor Minister under the Military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and in 1982 he became Governor of the Central Bank of Chile .   
 This was a complicated moment in Chile 's economy ; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and Chile 's big economic groups had liabilities with their own banks . As a Central Banker he worked to reduce the level of related loans ( loans made to the owners of the banks ) . He also created a mechanism called the `` Portfolio Sale '' through which the Central Bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks . By keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar , Miguel Kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars . However the central authority saw it otherwise and on June 13 , 1982 decided to devalue the peso . This brought a sharp loss of international reserves and Miguel Kast decided in August 1982 to completely free exchange rate thus further devaluing the peso and bringing a new intervention from the central authority . Under this new threat of instability , Miguel Kast resigned from the Central Bank .   
 Only few months after his resignation , in January 1983 , Miguel Kast learned he had bone cancer . He died on September 18 of the same year .   
 In recognition of Miguel Kast 's work , the Atlas Economic Research Foundation created an award named after him to recognise the Latin American think tank which has made the most important contribution to help reduce poverty.Two of his relatives are involved in politics too : his younger brother José Antonio , and one of his children , Felipe .

Allen William Mark ( Doc ) Coombs ( 23 October 1911 – 30 January 1995 ) was a British electronics engineer at the Post Office Research Station , Dollis Hill . He was one of the principal designers of the Mark II or production version of the Colossus computer used at Bletchley Park for codebreaking in World War II , and took over leadership of the project when Tommy Flowers moved on to other projects .   
 Later , he headed the scientific side of R14 , the division working on optical character recognition for postal mechanisation , which moved to the new BT Research Centre at Martlesham in Suffolk . His work on pattern recognition led to the development of an early postcode-reading machine .   
 He frequently lectured on pattern recognition using the concept of multi-dimensional space , and the 'caltrop ' , and would demonstrate the presence of feature-detection in the human visual system by means of a flash gun , the persistence of vision in the audience leading them to observe disintegration of a character fragment by fragment . 'Doc ' Coombs was notable for a facial 'tic ' , which gave him something of the appearance of the 'mad professor ' , and these days would probably be classed under Tourette 's syndrome .

He attended the University of Copenhagen and became a pastor at Reykholt in 1732 . He was reluctant to become a bishop due to the administrative duties the office entailed . He was also an accomplished scholar . In 1774 , he became the first Icelander to receive a Doctor of Theology degree . From 1772 to 1778 , he published Historia Ecclesiastica Islandiæ , a four-volume work containing publications of the church in Iceland in Latin .   
 Finnur 's son , Hannes Finnsson , succeeded his father as Bishop of Skálholt , having been ordained a bishop in 1777 . Finnur 's wife was Guðríður Gísladóttir ( 1707–1766 ) .

 = Godefroy de Blonay =   
Godefroy Jean Henri Louis de Blonay ( July 25 , 1869 in Niederschöntal , Switzerland – February 14 , 1937 in Biskra , Algeria ) , was an important early member of the International Olympic Committee .   
 From 1899 he was the first Swiss member on the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .   
 He was to be on the committee for 38 years until his death in 1937 , being the 24th on the roll of members since 1884 ; Pierre de Coubertin is number one . In 1912 de Blonay was one of the founders of the Swiss Olympic Association and from 1912 to 1915 he was its first president .   
 Baron de Blonay was for a time one of the closest confidants of the IOC 's legendary second president Pierre de Coubertin . When de Coubertin joined the French army in 1916 de Blonay became acting president of the IOC . A little bit earlier , when de Coubertin nearly ran out of money and took a back seat , de Blonay had been appointed to run an International Olympic executive committee , in lieu of the president . However , it has been suggested that he somehow upset de Coubertin by over-stretching the powers of this committee and it was this that may have caused him , surprisingly , not to have been chosen to succeed as the third IOC president in 1925 .

In 1839 he was appointed extraordinary professor of pathological anatomy , and in 1850 became head of the university 's clinical department .   
 In addition to his writings on anatomical and surgical matters , in his later years Bock wrote numerous essays and books on public health . These were written in clear and strident language and addressed to a popular audience , roughly in the style of Ernst Keil 's Die Gartenlaube , and so gained him a good deal of public recognition and influence .

 = Carlos Thays =   
Carlos Thays ( August 20 , 1849 – January 31 , 1934 ) was a French-Argentine landscape architect , and a student of French landscape architect Édouard André .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Born Jules Charles Thays in Paris , France in 1849 , Carlos Thays arrived in Argentina in 1889 , after he was recommended by Jean Alphand to Argentine pioneer Miguel Crisol , who contracted Thays to design Sarmiento Park in Córdoba . During his time in Córdoba Thays became infatuated with the young country and decided to spend the rest of his life in Argentina . After moving to Buenos Aires he was named the city 's Director of Parks & Walkways in 1891 . This position gave him significant influence over the design of the city 's open spaces , and his legacy is still strongly felt in the city 's open spaces today .   
 Major projects included tree planting along streets , remodeling and designing public plazas and walkways as well as designing completely new parks and expanding older ones . Major parks and plazas that particularly show Thays influence on Buenos Aires include the parks Centenario , Lezama , Patricios , Barrancas de Belgrano and the plazas Constitución , Congreso , and Mayo . Thays ' French heritage is reflected in many of his designs , in so far that Buenos Aires ' parks and plazas are often compared to similar designs in Paris .   
 One of Thays ' largest undertakings was the Parque Tres de Febrero , a sweeping area of open land covering several square kilometers filled with thousands of trees , flowers , many fountains , and monuments in the barrio of Palermo .   
 A pet project of his was the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden , for which he petitioned the city government to set aside land ( almost 8 hectares ) , which he designed in sections to display plants organised by continent , with a large section devoted to the native plants of Argentina , which were ignored in garden-making at the time . The garden has the first Ginkgo biloba planted in Argentina . Completed in 1898 , it bears his name , the Jardín Botánico Carlos Thays de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires . One greenhouse , was first erected at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and brought in sections from France to be reassembled , one of five in the garden . A brick house in the English Gothic Revival style , in which he lived during the construction and planting of the garden , now houses the herbarium and a small botanical library .   
    
 While Thays worked primarily in Buenos Aires throughout the years he also worked on many civic projects in other areas of Argentina , remodeling the Parque Sarmiento ) , Córdoba , designing the Parque Urquiza in Parana , Entre Rios , Parque 9 de Julio in San Miguel de Tucumán , the Parque de la Independencia in Rosario , and the Parque San Martin in Mendoza . Thays also designed the grounds of the luxurious Club Hotel de la Ventana , near Sierra de La Ventana in Buenos Aires Province . Work outside Argentina included the urban planning of the residential neighborhood of Carrasco , aid in the planning of the Parque Rodó , and the design of the Plaza Cagancha and Plaza Independencia in Montevideo , Uruguay.Thays worked most extensively in Buenos Aires precisely at a period in the city 's history where it was growing extremely fast as a result of immigration , especially from Spain and Italy . It is often noted that had Thays not insisted on high standards of design and frequent open spaces , many of the city 's current open spaces would probably not exist .   
 Next to the Perito Francisco Moreno and other prominent figures founded July 4 , 1912 Boy Scouts Association of Argentina .   
 Thays died in Buenos Aires in 1934 .

 =  C3 89mile Brumpt =   
Alexandre Joseph Émile Brumpt ( 10 March 1877 , Paris – 8 July 1951 ) was a French parasitologist.He studied zoology and parasitology in Paris , obtaining his degree in science in 1901 , and his medical doctorate in 1906 . In 1919 he succeeded Raphaël Blanchard ( 1857-1919 ) as professor of parasitology to the Faculté de Médecine de Paris , a position he maintained until 1948 . Much of his career was spent performing research in Africa and Latin America .   
 Brumpt is credited for introducing a technique known as xenodiagnosis into parasitological research .   
 In 1935 he described Plasmodium gallinaceum , an avian malarial parasite that infects chickens and other fowl . He also conducted important research involving the African tsetse fly ( Glossina palpalis ) as a biological vector for trypanosomiasis . In addition , he did extensive studies of the diseases : schistosomiasis , Chagas disease , onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis .   
 He described Blastocystis hominis and Entamoeba dispar . The latter species helped to explain why most people who appeared to be infected with Entamoeba histolytica were asymptomatic . However , because there are no morphological differences between the two species , his proposal was largely ignored for over 50 years before being proven correct using molecular techniques.The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Prix Savigny for 1910 . A number of parasitic species bear his name , including Plasmodium brumpti and Xenocoeloma brumpti . Also , a genus of phlebotomine sand flies , Brumptomyia , and a species of Corsican mosquito , Culex brumpti , are named after him .   
 Brumpt 's best known written work is Précis de Parasitologie , which was published in six editions between 1910 and 1949 . He was the author of many scientific papers , including several on the Anopheles mosquito and its relationship to malaria . He was the President of the Société zoologique de France in 1922 . With Maurice Neveu-Lemaire and Maurice Langeron , he founded in 1923 the parasitological journal Annales de Parasitologie Humaine et Comparée , now continued as Parasite .

 After graduating from college , Lawyer joined the U.S. Air Force and trained as a fighter pilot . He was a distinguished graduate of the Air Force Fighter Weapons School and served two combat tours during the Vietnam War . On his first tour early in the conflict , Lawyer served as a forward air controller directing air strikes against enemy troops . He served his second tour later in the war as an F-4 pilot and fought in Operation Linebacker.Lawyer became involved in flight test in 1958 when his squadron was selected to test the F-105B . He attended the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School ( now the USAF Test Pilot School ) at Edwards AFB and graduated with class 63A receiving the school 's A.B . Honts Award as the outstanding member of his class for academic achievement and flying excellence . In 1965 , Lawyer was selected as one of the first astronauts to the Air Force 's classified Manned Orbital Laboratory . The MOL program , canceled in 1969 before sending any astronauts into space , was to man a military space station with Air Force astronauts using a modified Gemini spacecraft . Unable to transfer to NASA due to age restrictions , Lawyer did not achieve his goal of space flight , but continued flying for the Air Force . He retired from USAF service in 1982 as a Colonel .   
    
    
 == Lost spacesuits recovered ==   
    
 In June 2005 , security officers examining a long-unused room at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5/6 museum discovered two spacesuits . The suits were not the usual NASA white but were instead a pale blue color used by the short-lived U.S. Air Force space program . The first suit was labeled 007 , and the second had both a label , 008 , and a name , `` Lawyer '' . Investigators determined the second spacesuit was one used by Lawyer who had been assigned to evaluate spacesuits for the MOL program . The story of the recovered spacesuits and the history of the MOL program was presented in the Public Television series NOVA episode called Astrospies which aired February 12 , 2008 . One spacesuit was sent to the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum and the other to Florida for exhibition at the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame .

 After retiring from the Air Force , Lawyer worked as a commercial test pilot for a number of firms at the Mojave Airport & Spaceport including the National Test Pilot School . He remained an active pilot up to the time of his death on November 12 , 2005 . Lawyer had just returned from a hunting trip when he died unexpectedly in his Palmdale , California home of a suspected blood clot . He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on January 5 , 2006 . Lawyer is survived by his wife , Gayle , five children , and nine grandchildren .

 = Lidia Selkregg =   
Lidia Lippi Selkregg ( 1920 - August 14 , 1999 ) was an Italian geologist and professor of regional planning at the University of Alaska Anchorage . In the days following the 1964 Alaska earthquake , Selkregg helped organize a group of local geologists to gather important data about earthquake damage to inform future recommendations about building stability . She also helped promote earthquake safety , land preservation , and economic development in the Anchorage area .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Lidia Lippi was born in Florence , Italy , in 1920 . Her father died when she was three years old , and she lived in Italy and North Africa with her mother and two brothers . During World War II , Lippi and her mother lived in Florence , Italy , where she worked as a nurse . She also joined the Italian resistance against the Nazis.Lippi married Fred Selkregg in 1945 . They had three children : Alicia , Sheila , and Leif.Lidia Selkregg trained as a geologist . She received her doctorate degree from the University of Illinois in Champaign.The Selkreggs moved to Alaska in 1958 . Lidia Selkregg worked as a planner in Anchorage . She wrote the Economic Development Administration Grant for the Port of Anchorage , and she fought to protect land for the Anchorage watershed.In the aftermath of the 1964 Alaska earthquake , the most powerful recorded earthquake in U.S. history , a small group of professional geologists , led by Selkregg , then a geologist with the Alaska State Housing Authority , were authorized by the housing authority and city officials to outline immediate courses of action . The Engineering Geology Evaluation Group was formed , consisting of a volunteer team of local geologists , engineering geologists , and soil scientists . Starting just two days after the earthquake , the group mapped the entire earthquake area and obtained aerial photographs of the damage . They also measured all of the vertical and horizontal displacements in the area . They released a preliminary report on April 14 , 1964 , and a final report on May 8 , 1964 . This report was later used by the Scientific and Engineering Task Force , appointed by the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission for Alaska , to make recommendations about stability in the wake of the earthquake.Selkregg also worked to get the population of Valdez to move away from the previous site of their town . In the years after the earthquake , she worked to raise awareness among the public about earthquake risk.From 1971 to 1985 , Selkregg was a professor of resources and socioeconomic planning and regional planning at the University of Alaska Anchorage , where she developed a graduate planning program . She was the editor of the `` Environmental Atlas of the Greater Anchorage Area Borough , '' published by the University of Alaska in 1972.Selkregg served on the Advisory Committee to the Carter White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development ; she also served in the Anchorage Assembly . As a member of the Assembly , she helped create the city 's network of trails and parks.Selkregg died on August 14 , 1999 . She was inducted into the Alaska Women 's Hall of Fame in 2009 .

 = Nikolai Golovanov =   
Nikolai Semyonovich Golovanov ( Russian : Никола́й Семёнович Голова́нов , Nikoláy Semyónovich Golovánov ) ( [ o.s . 9 ] 21 January 1891 – 28 August 1953 ) , PAU , was a Soviet conductor and composer , who was married to the soprano Antonina Nezhdanova .   
 He conducted the premiere performances of a number of works , among them Nikolai Myaskovsky 's Sixth Symphony in May 1924.Golovanov held some of the highest musical positions in the USSR , including an extensive association with the Bolshoi Opera . In her autobiography , Galina Vishnevskaya terms him the theater 's chief conductor , and tells of his dismissal from the Bolshoi and his death - which she attributed to the humiliation of the experience of losing this position . It has been reported that Golovanov 's firing was the result of Stalin 's displeasure at Golovanov 's having tried to use a Jewish singer , Mark Reizen , in the title role of Tsar Boris Godunov in his recording of Mussorgsky 's opera . Golovanov actually did record the opera with Reizen as Boris , but later remade Reizen 's part with another Boris , Alexander Pirogov .   
 Golovanov 's recorded output was substantial and quite individual in interpretive approach . In his discography we find all but one of the Liszt tone poems , the complete Scriabin symphonies and Piano Concerto , Tchaikovsky 's First and Sixth symphonies , as well as shorter works , Beethoven 's First Symphony , Violin Concerto and Triple Concerto , Rimsky-Korsakov 's Scheherazade and his operas Sadko and Christmas Eve , Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov and Pictures at an Exhibition , Rachmaninoff 's Second and Third symphonies , the opera Aleko and other compositions , Glazunov 's Fifth , Sixth and Seventh symphonies , and scores by Grieg , Mozart and others . Based upon the evidence of his recordings , Golovanov 's characteristic performance mode was full-blooded and nearly vehement in tone , with a powerful , almost overloaded sense of sonority , and extreme flexibility in matters of tempo , phrasing and dynamics .   
 In addition to audio recordings by Golovanov , there is extant visual representation of his conducting style . Possibly during the Second World War , evidently intended as a morale booster , there was produced a film of Golovanov conducting a group called the USSR State Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the Tchaikovsky `` 1812 Overture . '' As was the practice in the USSR , the Tsarist anthem was replaced in the score with the chorus `` Glory , Glory to you , holy Russia ! '' from Glinka 's `` A Life for the Tsar . '' The film does not feature synchronous sound , and concerns itself primarily with various Soviet functionaries , Military figures and Orthodox Priests ( ! ) in the audience ; However , the short segments of Golovanov conducting show an energetic but physically spare conducting style , one seemingly at odds with the sometimes extreme nature of his interpretations .   
 Golovanov was also a composer ; his works include the opera `` Princess Yurata '' , a symphony and other orchestral works as well as choral music .

 = Johann Conrad Brunner =   
Johann Conrad Brunner ( 16 January 1653 – 2 October 1727 ) was a Swiss anatomist , especially cited for his work on the pancreas and duodenum .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Brunner was born in Diessenhofen , and studied medicine in Schaffhausen , Strasbourg , Amsterdam , London and Paris . At Schaffhausen he studied under Johann Jakob Wepfer ( 1620–1695 ) , who was also his father-in-law . He received his doctorate in 1672 from the University of Strasbourg . Beginning in 1686 he was a professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Heidelberg . In 1716 , Brunner was appointed personal physician to Charles III Philip the new Elector of the Palatinate . He received many accolades during his life including a knighthood with the title `` Brunn von Hammerstein '' . He died in 1727 in Mannheim , Germany .   
    
    
 == Work ==   
 Brunner is remembered for his experiments and studies of the pancreas and the internal secretions associated with that organ . In 1683 he removed the pancreas from a dog and noticed that the animal experienced extreme thirst and polyuria . Despite his intuitive grasp of the connection between the pancreas and diabetes , he was unable to provide a theoretical link for the role of the pancreas in that disease . He published his findings on pancreatic research in a treatise titled Experimenta Nova circa Pancreas . Accedit diatribe de lympha & genuino pancreatis usu .   
 in 1687 he described tubuloalveolar glands in the submucous layer of the duodenum , which were later named Brunner 's glands . Two disorders associated with these glands are :   
    
 `` Brunner 's gland hyperplasia '' : Hypertrophy of Brunner 's glands in the submucosal layer of the duodenum .   
 `` Brunner 's gland adenoma '' : Polyp-like tumours arising from Brunner 's glands .

 == Biography ==   
 Vicq d'Azyr was born in Valognes , Normandy , the son of a physician . He graduated in medicine at the University of Paris and became a renowned and brilliant animal and human anatomist and physician .   
 From 1773 Vicq d'Azyr taught a celebrated course of anatomy at the Jardin du Roi , currently the Museum of Natural History , in Paris . In 1774 he was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences with the support of his friend Condorcet , the Perpetual Secretary . In this latter capacity , he was in charge of writing the eulogies of his colleagues . This he accomplished with great talent , thus winning a lifetime membership to the Académie française in 1788 . On the outbreak of an epidemic in Guyenne he was charged with writing a report , of making propositions and with their execution . Pursuing an early perception of the responsibility of the State on health affairs , Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot proposed the creation of the Société Royale de Médecine . In 1775 , Vicq d'Azyr was made Perpetual Secretary . Under his leadership , the Société compiled over 16 years a great mass of facts and information about diseases , physicians , economics and food resources .   
 He was the last physician of Queen Marie-Antoinette , whom he tried to protect .   
 Additionally he was a professor of veterinary medicine at the School of Alfort , as well as Superintendent of epidemics .   
 As an anatomist he was one of the first to use coronal sections of the brain and to use alcohol to aid dissection . He described the locus coeruleus , the locus niger ( substantia nigra ) in the brain , in 1786 , and the band of Vicq d'Azyr , a fiber system between the external granular layer and the external pyramidal layer of the cerebral cortex , as well as the Mamillo-thalamic tract , which bears his name . His systematic studies of the cerebral convolutions became a classic and Vicq d'Azyr was one of the first neuroanatomists to name the gyri . He studied the deep gray nuclei of the cerebrum and the basal ganglia . He participated in the Second Encyclopedia . During the French Revolution he was elected to the Commission temporaire des arts , where he was charged with determining the future of anatomical education in France.Vicq d'Azyr died of tuberculosis on 20 June 1794 during The Terror . He had that day attended Robespierre 's Festival of the Supreme Being . His dramatic biography describes him as spending his last remaining years shaken by nightmares and terrified of the guillotine.A collection of some of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda , Maryland .

 == Genocide in Ukraine ==   
 In his works , he argued that the famine in Soviet Ukraine during the early 1930s was an act of genocide on the part of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin .   
 In 1982 at an international conference on the Holocaust and genocide Mace stated : `` In order to centralize the power in the hands of Stalin , what was needed was to destroy the Ukrainian peasant , the Ukrainian intellectuals , the Ukrainian language , Ukrainian understanding of their history and to destroy Ukraine as such . This was simply calculated and primitive : No people , as a result no country , and the result - no problem . ''   
 As the director of the US Commission into the study of the Ukrainian Famine he collected eye-witness accounts from survivors in North America . Over 200 hours of audio recording were handed over to the Ukrainian Parliamentary Library in Kyiv . The tapes of these eyewitness accounts were found scattered over the floor of the library vandalized , some totally destroyed .

 = Frederic A. Gibbs =   
Frederic Andrews Gibbs ( 1903–1992 ) was an American neurologist who was a pioneer in the use of electroencephalography ( EEG ) for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy .   
 Gibbs graduated from Yale and Johns Hopkins in 1929 . He was offered a fellowship in neuropathology by Stanley Cobb , of Harvard Medical School . He studied epilepsy in the same laboratory as William G. Lennox and Erna Leonhardt .   
 Erna Leonhardt was Lennox 's technical co-worker and had come to Boston as an immigrant from Germany . [ 1 ] She married Gibbs in 1930 and they formed a research team that would last a lifetime , publishing papers together over the next fifty-odd years .   
 The electroencephalograph was primitive in the early 1930s , having only one channel . In 1935 , Gibbs asked Albert Grass ( an MIT graduate ) to build a 3-channel EEG . Grass built the machine in his father 's basement with the help of his brother . In the same year , Erna and Frederic Gibbs travelled to Europe to attend a conference and visit Hans Berger , the inventor of the EEG . [ 2 ] In 1944 , they moved to University of Illinois School of Medicine , and Frederic Gibbs was promoted to professor in the epilepsy clinic .   
 The Gibbs published the book `` Atlas of electroencephalography '' in 1941 , with a second edition in 1951 . Their book valued the subjective and experienced eye of an electroencephalographer over objective mechanical or mathematical analysis . [ 3 ] Frederic Gibbs was jointly ( with William Lennox ) awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1951 .   
 Erna Gibbs died in 1987 .

 = Hsien Wu =   
Hsien Wu ( simplified Chinese : 吴宪 ; traditional Chinese : 吳憲 ; pinyin : Wú Xiàn ; 24 November 1893 – 8 August 1959 ) was a Chinese biochemist and geneticist . He was the first to propose that protein denaturation was a purely conformational change , i.e. , corresponded to protein unfolding and not to some chemical alteration of the protein . This crucial idea was popularized later by Linus Pauling and Alfred Mirsky.Wu was born in Fuzhou , Fujian , China . He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( undergraduate ) , and then trained at Harvard University ( graduate ) under Otto Folin , developing the first assay for blood sugar ( Folin-Wu method ) . Wu then returned to China to a position at Peking Union Medical College , becoming head of the biochemistry department in 1924 at age 30 .   
 Wu left China in 1947 to reside in the United States .   
 Wu 's son , Ray J. Wu , became the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor of Molecular Genetics and Biology at Cornell University , and was active in studying transgenic plants , particularly rice .

 = Manuel Prado Ugarteche =   
Manuel Carlos Prado y Ugarteche ( April 21 , 1889 – August 15 , 1967 ) was a banker who served twice as President of Peru . Son of former president Mariano Ignacio Prado , he was born in Lima and served as the nation 's 50th ( 1939 - 1945 ) and 54th ( 1956 - 1962 ) President . His brother , Leoncio Prado Gutiérrez , was a military hero who died in 1883 , six years before Manuel Prado was born .   
 As a young army officer , Prado was a key player in the coup that overthrew peruvian president Guillermo Billinghurst in 1914 . He became president of the Central Reserve Bank in 1934 .   
 Manuel Prado , a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family , reached the presidency of Peru with the help of the left-wing Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana party . Prado announced that `` one of the first acts of my government will be to declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties . ''   
 During Prado 's second presidency ( 1956–1962 ) , the only significant proscribed party was the APRA ( American Popular Revolutionary Alliance ) , which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría . Prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected Congress a bill to legalize APRA once again . The bill was later passed and the APRA 's famed founder , Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre , returned from foreign exile .   
 In foreign policy , Prado – whose greatest pride was that as President in 1942 he made Peru the first of the South American nations to break off relations with the Axis Powers– was expected to side firmly with the U.S . There is documentary evidence that shows that Prado 's enthusiastic support of the deportation of Peruvians of Japanese descent to the United States during World War II was motivated by a desire to rid Peru of all of its Japanese-descended residents—a charge which some historians have argued amounted to a campaign of ethnic cleansing .

 = Fabrizio Mordente =   
Fabrizio Mordente ( Salerno , 1532 – ca 1608 ) was an Italian mathematician . He is best known for his invention of the `` proportional eight-pointed compass '' which has two arms with cursors that allow the solution of problems in measuring the circumference , area and angles of a circle . In 1567 he published a single sheet treatise in Venice showing illustrations of his device .   
    
    
 == Life and career ==   
 Fabrizio Mordente was born in Salerno , Italy , and studied at the Università di Napoli . After completing his studies at the age of 20 , he set out to see the world . He left Naples in 1552 and visited Crete , Cyprus , Egypt , Palestine and Mesopotamia . After reaching the Persian Gulf , he took a Portuguese ship to India . He stayed in Goa for three years and then continued his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope , eventually arriving in Lisbon . He went from there to Paris and visited other European cities before returning to Italy and visiting Venice , Florence and Rome . During this trip he drafted the initial design for his compass.Based on the success of his design , Mordente took service in 1571 at the court of Emperor Maximilian II in Vienna . From 1578 he served in Prague at the court of Rudolph II , to whom he dedicated an edition of Anversa in 1584 . In Prague , he also met Michiel Coignet and Giordano Bruno , who used the compass to refute Aristotle 's hypothesis on the incommensurability of infinitesimals , thus confirming the existence of the `` minimum '' which was the basis of his atomic theory . Bruno published the dialogues Mordentius and De Mordentii circino which praised Mordente , but also presented criticisms that raised protests from the mathematician . Mordente replied in 1586 and Bruno responded with the satires Idiota triumphans and De somnii interpretatione . After Mordente gained support in the dispute from the French Charles , Duke of Guise , Bruno was forced to flee Paris .   
 After this controversy , Mordente took service with the Duke of Guise until his death . In 1591 Mordente returned to Italy and entered the service of Alexander Farnese , Duke of Parma , where he published his last mathematical treatise .   
    
    
 == Publication ==   
 Mordente published a number of treatises on mathematics and the use of his compass . These include :

 = Wim Blok =   
Willem Johannes `` Wim '' Blok ( 1947–2003 ) was a Dutch logician who made major contributions to algebraic logic , universal algebra , and modal logic . His important achievements over the course of his career include `` a brilliant demonstration of the fact that various techniques and results that originated in universal algebra can be used to prove significant and deep theorems in modal logic . `` Blok began his career in 1973 as an algebraist investigating the varieties of interior algebras at the University of Illinois at Chicago . Following the 1976 completion of his Ph.D. on that topic , he continued on to study more general varieties of modal algebras . As an algebraist , Blok `` was recognised by the modal logic community as one of the most influential modal logicians '' by the end of the 1970s . He published many papers in the Reports on Mathematical Logic , served as a member on their editorial board , and was one of their guest editors . Along with Don Pigozzi , Wim Blok co-authored the monograph Algebraizable Logics which began the field now known as abstract algebraic logic.He died in a car accident on November 30 , 2003 .

Leon Jan Piniński ( 8 March 1857 – 4 April 1938 ) was a Polish scholar , diplomat , art historian and politician . A professor of Roman law and one-time rector of the Lwów University ( 1928–1929 ) , he devoted much of his life to a political career in his home city of Lwów ( modern Lviv , Ukraine ) , first under Austria-Hungary then in newly independent Poland .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Leon Piniński was born in Lwów , then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia . A member of the Piniński noble family with the Austrian rank of hrabia - ( Count ) , he was a younger brother of Stanisław whose daughter , Julia Pinińska , inherited the family castle and estate in Grzymałów Hrymailiv . After homeschooling , Leon went on to pass his matura exam at the renowned Jesuit college in Tarnopol . He later graduated from the Faculty of Law at Lwów University . Piniński continued further studies at the universities of Leipzig , Berlin and Vienna . In 1891 he became a professor of Roman law at his alma mater and was elected to membership of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences .   
 A year later he gave up his scholarly career to devote himself to local politics . A member of the Podolacy aristocratic political faction , he became one of the most popular conservative politicians in Lwów . In 1889 he was elected to the Imperial Council in Vienna . In 1894 he was also elected to the Galician Sejm . His terms in both offices ended in 1898 , when he became the governor of the province of Galicia . During this time he actively opposed the growing popularity of Socialist ideas . He also tried to counter the rise of Ukrainian nationalism . Extremely conservative , in 1903 he was dismissed from office and replaced by the politically liberal industrial mogul , Andrzej Kazimierz Potocki .   
 Although Piniński retained his seat in the Austro-Hungarian Senate , he retired from public life and devoted himself to advanced studies of law as well as art history . During World War I he briefly returned to politics , but was not as successful as before . Following the rebirth of Poland , Piniński returned to his alma mater as professor of Roman law and lectured on criminal and civil law . In 1928 and 1929 he briefly served as a rector of Lwów University . At the same time , he continued his history of art research and managed to gather an extensive collection of works of art . Most of it he later donated to Wawel Castle Museum and the Ossolineum . A large part of his collection , which included English prints , was later stolen by the Germans during World War II and was never returned to Poland . Piniński himself retired in 1930s and died in Lwów , where he is buried .   
    
    
 == Pretender to the English throne ==

He helped to establish the Tonantzintla Observatory and he later directed it . He received the National Prize for Arts and Sciences in 1970 .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Graef Fernández was born in Guanaceví , Durango , where his father was a mining engineer . He had two younger siblings ; his brother Hermann became an accomplished physician . He attributed an early interest in science to a physics book that his mother gave him as a child.Graef Fernández first studied at a German school in Mexico , then went to Technische Hochschule Darmstadt ( today Technische Universität Darmstadt ) in the German city of Darmstadt for a couple of years before returning to Mexico . He completed his undergraduate education at UNAM , and he was influenced by UNAM scientists Manuel Sandoval Vallarta and Sotero Prieto , who each mentored several successful Mexican scientists.Awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and other assistance , including a stipend awarded by Mexican president Lázaro Cárdenas , Graef Fernández went to MIT . Around that time , he married Alicia Sánchez Castell and they later had three children . He completed a doctorate at MIT in 1940 and worked at Harvard University . At Harvard , Graef Fernández met Luis Enrique Erro , who invited him to join the effort to found the Tonantzintla Observatory in the Mexican state of Puebla . In The Skin of the Sky , Graef Fernández is described as `` small , round and prone to a cordiality that made him lovable '' ; he seemed an unlikely partner for Erro , who was a slender , elegant man with a hearing aid.Ultimately , Graef Fernández was more interested in studying gravitational issues than astrophysics , so he sought an academic position . He joined the UNAM faculty , where he directed the Institute of Physics and the Faculty of Sciences . Graef Fernández organized the meeting that led to the establishment of the Mexican Mathematical Society in 1943 . He was also a founding member of the Mexican Physical Society in 1951 . The society awards the Carlos Graef Fernández Prize . He was awarded the National Prize for Arts and Sciences in 1970.Graef Fernández served on numerous committees related to the nuclear industry .

Huai C. Chiang ( 15 February 1915 – 30 March 2005 ) was an American entomologist of Chinese origin . A professor of entomology at the University of Minnesota he was a specialist on integrated pest management , particularly in corn and other field crops .   
 Chiang was born in Sunjiang County , Jiansu Province and after studying in Beijing , he moved to Tsinghua University in 1934 . He became interested in insects when he worked in summer with Liu Chongle . With the war between Japan and China on , his studies were interrupted and along with 250 classmates , they walked for 68 days to escape from Changsha to Kunming in April 1938 . Chiang then worked with Liu at the Tsinghua University which also moved to Kunming . Here he met Zoe-ing Shen , a chemist at the university who he would marry later . During the second world war , the US air force used Kunming as a base and Chiang interacted with Sam Billings who worked with a US Army anti-malaria unit . Chiang then applied to the University of Minnesota while Zoe joined Smith College in Northampton , MA . Chiang was to study under Royal N. Chapman but by the time he arrived in the US , Chapman had died and his advisor was A.C. Hodson . Chiang and Zoe married in 1946 . After completing his PhD he took up a temporary position at the University of Minnesota and in 1953 he obtained a teaching position and a bit later , a tenure track position . He became noted for his teaching and received a teacher of the year award in 1961 . In 1960 he took up a position in insect ecology which he held until his retirement in 1984 .   
 Chiang worked on a range of species and topics including Ostrinia nubilalis in corn , Diabrotica spp. , biological control , crop loss evaluation , and the midge Anarete prichardi . He was a visitor to China from 1975 and from 1980 he initiated a collaboration between University of Minnesota and Chinese entomologists . He naturalized as an American citizen in 1953 . During the McCarthy era , his background was frequently investigated and Chiang wrote that the FBI officers were `` courteous '' . In 1975 he wrote about how Chinese agriculture was well-managed with fewer pests wit more ecological approaches used in control than chemical ones .

 = Heino Eller =   
Heino Eller ( 7 March 1887 – 16 June 1970 ) was an Estonian composer and composition teacher .   
    
    
 == Life ==   
 Eller was born in Tartu , where he took private lessons in violin and music theory , played in several ensembles and orchestras , and performed as violin soloist . In 1907 he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to study violin . From 1908 to 1911 he was a law student . In 1920 Eller graduated from the conservatory renamed to Petrograd Conservatory .   
 From 1920 to 1940 , Eller was a professor of music theory and composition at the Tartu Higher School for Music .

In 1940 he became a professor of composition at the Tallinn Conservatory and taught there until his death in 1970 . He was named a People 's Artist of the USSR in 1967 .   
 Eller was a teacher of composition . The school he formed in Tartu counterbalanced the so-called Tallinn school headed by Artur Kapp . Eller 's pedagogical talent is versatile . The list of his pupils offers the best proof of this : each of them has created a distinguished original style . Among his students were Eduard Tubin , Villem Kapp , Kaljo Raid , Boris Kõrver , Anatoli Garshnek , Leo Normet , Valter Ojakäär , Uno Naissoo , Arne Oit , Jaan Rääts , Heino Jürisalu , Arvo Pärt , Alo Põldmäe , Lepo Sumera , Boris Parsadanian , Alfred Karindi , Eduard Oja , Olav Roots and Karl Leichter .   
    
    
 == Selected works ==   
 Eller primarily composed instrumental music . His symphonic works , especially Koit and Videvik , break new ground for Estonian symphonic music . His musical language contains many national traits , but he was influenced by 20th-century styles as diverse as impressionism and expressionism .

 = Harold Maxwell-Lefroy =   
Harold Maxwell-Lefroy ( 20 January 1877 – 14 October 1925 ) was an English entomologist . He was a Professor of Entomology at Imperial College London who was posted as the second Imperial Entomologist to India . He worked on applied entomology and initiated experiments on the use of chemicals to control insects , founding the Rentokil company .   
    
    
 == Biography ==   
 Maxwell-Lefory was born in the village of Crondall to Charles James Maxwell Lefroy of the 14th Hussars and Elizabeth Catherine McClintock.and attended Marlborough College and King 's College , Cambridge , matriculating in 1895 and receiving a BA in the natural science tripos with first class in 1898 followed by a master 's degree in 1902.He served as assistant master of Seaford College , and later worked as an entomologist in Barbados from 1899 . In 1903 , Lefroy was appointed entomologist to the Government of India ( succeeding Lionel de Nicéville , who was the first entomologist , appointed in 1901 ) . Then in 1905 he was involved in the creation of the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in Pusa , in the Indian state of Bihar , and he was appointed the first Imperial Entomologist .   
 Lefroy convened a series of meetings on an all-India basis , to bring together all the entomologists of the country . From 1915 , five such meetings were held at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute , and these formed the foundation of entomological knowledge in India . He was succeeded in the position of Imperial Entomologist by T. Bainbrigge Fletcher . He published Indian Insect Life , a summary of the major insects of economic importance in 1906 , in association with Frank Milburn Howlett .   
 In the early 1920s , Lefroy was asked by Sir Frank Baines , Principal Architect of the Office of Works , to study ways of exterminating death watch beetles that had been found in Westminster Hall , beside England 's Houses of Parliament . As a result , he went on to devise various successful formulations for pest control , and in time Lefroy began receiving regular orders from people who had heard about his work . In 1924 , Lefroy and his assistant Miss Elizabeth Eades started supplying bottles of woodworm fluid from a small factory in Hatton Garden , which later led to the formation by them of a company called Rentokil Limited ( now Rentokil Initial ) in 1925 .   
 Lefroy was killed by poisonous fumes in a laboratory accident in October 1925 . It is thought that he was experimenting with Lewisite . Lefroy married Kathleen Hamilton O'Meara , second daughter of a provost-marshal in British Guiana . They had three children Gladys Kathleen , Charles , and Cecil Anthony Maxwell Lefroy ( later CBE ) .

 Boissevain was the youngest of nine children . Her father was a shipowner from a rich Huguenot merchant family and her mother was the daughter of a lawyer .   
    
    
 == Education ==   
 Boissevain attended a high school for girls . After graduating , Boissevain attended a lecture on botany by Hugo de Vries , which sparked her interest in the subject . In 1896 , she started studying natural science at the University of Amsterdam . Here she specialised in zoology . After graduating , she moved to Zurich to do further research on the Dentalium species and at age 25 attained the title of doctor . Afterwards , she moved back to the Netherlands where she became a curator for Artis , a Dutch zoo and association for zoology . She would remain active as a researcher until 1915 , but would retain her interest in zoology afterwards . Four mollusk taxa are named after her : the species Cadulus boissevaini , Antalis boissevainae , Fustiaria Mariae and the genus Boissevainia .   
    
    
 == Women 's rights ==   
 While in Zurich , Boissevain encountered international students who were interested in women 's rights . When she returned to the Netherlands , she visited Aletta Jacobs to talk about the Dutch women 's rights movement .

As a youth he joined to become a member of the NDSAP , the Nazi party , and regretted it in a posthumous biography . He received the national prize of the GDR in 1965 . A school in Berlin is named after him .   
 Dathe was born in Reichenbach where his father was an office manager . In the 1930s he studied zoology , botany and geology at the University of Leipzig . He was interested in research and travel . His early work was as an assistant at the Leipzig zoological gardens under Karl Max Schneider and he worked on a doctoral thesis on the male reproductive organs of guinea pigs and other rodents . He became a deputy director of Leipzig zoo . In 1932 he joined the NSDAP due to feelings of patriotism . During the second world war he was injured in one arm . At the end of the war he was held as a British prisoner . During this time he contemplated suicide but was inspired when he saw a woodchat shrike . He gave ornithological lectures to the other prisoners . When he returned to Leipzig he was not allowed to work due to his former party membership . He worked in a series of small jobs , helping on the market , and at one point employed to imitate different bird songs on the radio . From 1950 he allowed to teach at Leipzig University . 1950 was also the year in which he was hired by Leipzig Zoo . Between 1955 and 1957 he served as acting director.Dathe helped rebuild the Berlin zoo after the war . He was appointed director for the zoo and he served for more than three decades during which time he appeared regularly in radio and TV shows making him popular.In his memoirs Dathe downplayed his association with the Nazi party . He claimed that he joined the party before it became politically powerful . Dathe however was a director of the chapter ( Ortsgruppe ) at Leipzig zoo that helped in grassroots activities.Dathe died of cancer in 1991 . His grave in Friedrichsfelde is specially honored by the city of Berlin . His sons Holger and Falk are also well known zoologists . Heinrich-Dathe-Platz and Dathe-promenade at the Tierpark metro station are named after him . A memorial plaque was installed in the elephant house at the zoo in 2012 . A school in Friedrichshain was renamed after him as the Dathe-Gymnasium but it was criticized on the basis of Dathe 's NSDAP membership but this was debated and finally retained by a committee .

Under the supervision of his eldest brother he became an apprentice in a factory . He would stay in Mexico for the next twenty years . He survived a shipwreck off the coast of Yucatán . Between 1852 and 1867 he worked as a merchant for German exporters of manufactured goods . During this time he began under the guidance of his friend Carl Hermann Berendt collecting shells of native snails , which would constitute the basis of his collection . At this time , he began a lively exchange with German and American malacologists . He was also introduced by Berendt to zoology and archeology   
 In 1860 he married Inés Mahn , a merchant 's daughter , born in Mexico . In 1861 , his first son Richard Strebel was born . In 1867 the family , now consisting of five members , moved to Hamburg .

At first he turned his attention to working out his zoological collections . Through contact with other German malacologists he published from 1873 to 1882 his first scientific papers on the Mexican land and freshwater molluscs . His book on the fauna of Mexico was published in 1882 , after six years ' work and was acclaimed as one of the best and most detailed faunistic monographs of the subject . It provided him the respect of all contemporary authorities as a great scholar .   
    
 After the publication of this book , he turned his attention to Mexican archeology . He asked a befriended family in Mexico to perform archaeological excavations at various locations The results became his scientific collection in Hamburg . To finance further excavation activities , he sold some excavation finds to the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin , the Hamburg Senate and to the city of Leipzig . His writings on this subject are comprised in ten treatises , of which two volumes on Old Mexico and some more recent studies of ornaments and earthen vessels .

Pierre Victor Auger ( 14 May 1899 – 25 December 1993 ) was a French physicist , born in Paris . He worked in the fields of atomic physics , nuclear physics , and cosmic ray physics . He is famous for being one of the discoverers of the Auger effect , named after him .   
    
    
 == Early life ==   
 Pierre 's father was chemistry professor Victor Auger . Pierre Auger was a student at the École normale supérieure in Paris from 1919 to 1922 , the year when he passed the agrégation of physics . He then joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the faculté des sciences of the University of Paris under the direction of Jean Perrin to work there on the photoelectric effect .   
    
    
 == Career ==   
 In 1926 he obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Paris . In 1927 , he was named assistant to the faculté des sciences of Paris and , at the same time , adjoint chief of service to l'Institut de biologie physico-chimique . Chief of work to faculty in 1934 and general secretary of the annual tables of the constants in 1936 , he was named university lecturer in physics to the faculty on the first of November 1937 . He was charged with , until 1940 , the course on the experimental bases of the quantum theory within the chair of theoretical physics and astrophysics . He was also adjoint director of the laboratory of physical chemistry . He then occupied the chair of quantum physics and relativity of the faculté des sciences of Paris .   
 At the end of World War II , he was named director of higher education from 1945 to 1948 , which permitted him to introduce the first chair of genetics at the Sorbonne , conferred upon Boris Ephrussi .   
 The process where Auger electrons are emitted from atoms is used in Auger electron spectroscopy to study the elements on the surface of materials . This method was named after him , despite the fact that Lise Meitner discovered the process a few years before in 1922 .   
    
    
 == Findings ==   
 In his work with cosmic rays , he found that the cosmic radiation events were coincident in time meaning that they were associated with a single event , an air shower . He estimated that the energy of the incoming particle that creates large air showers must be at least 1015 electronvolts ( eV ) = 106 particles of 108 eV ( critical energy in air ) and a factor of ten for energy loss from traversing the atmosphere .   
    
    
 == Honors and achievements ==   
 He was European Space Research Organisation ( ESRO ) first Director General and one of the forefathers for the CERN foundation.He was president of the Centre international de calcul ( Rome ) . From 1948 to 1959 , he directed at UNESCO the department of mathematical and natural sciences.He was elected a member of the Académie des sciences in 1977 .   
 He hosted a broadcast of popularization of exacting science on Friday evenings on the public radio station France Culture from September 1969 to June 1986 , entitled Les Grandes Avenues de la science moderne.The world 's largest cosmic ray detector , the Pierre Auger Observatory , is named after him .
