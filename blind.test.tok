= charles-louis hanon =
charles-louis hanon ( 2 july 1819 – 19 march 1900 ) was a french piano pedagogue and composer . he is best known for his work the virtuoso pianist in 60 exercises , which is still used today for modern piano teaching , but over the years the method has also faced criticisms . he was born in renescure , france in 1819 , and died in boulogne-sur-mer in 1900 .


== biography ==
charles-louis hanon was born in northern france in the village of renescure on july 2 , 1819 . trained as an organist by a local teacher , it is not known if he received more advanced musical education . at age 27 , he moved a short distance east from renescure to boulogne-sur-mer where he lived with his brother françois who was also a musician .
music was never the exclusive focus of hanon 's life : he was also a devout roman catholic , a third order franciscan and a member of the society of st. vincent de paul .
it is known from an 1869 article that hanon was involved with a monastic order called the “ brothers of the christian schools . ” founded in the 17th century by saint john baptist de la salle , the schools run by the order provide free instruction to poor children . one such school was established in boulogne-sur-mer in approximately 1815 by léon de chanlaire and father benoît-agathon haffreingue , free music instruction was offered there by 1830 . ( 1 )


== the virtuoso pianist ==
piano students all over the world know of hanon 's famous training exercises . both sergei rachmaninoff and josef lhévinne claimed hanon to be the secret of why the russian piano school delivered an explosion of virtuosi in their time , for the hanon exercises have been obligatory for a long time throughout russian conservatories ; there were special examinations at which one had to know all exercises by heart , to be played in all keys at high speed .
although most respected pedagogues and pianists acknowledge the value of hanon 's exercises , they have their detractors . some critics have questioned the merits of the independent finger technique which the exercises seek to cultivate , with some pedagogues , such as abby whiteside , considering them to be actively harmful .
it has become a custom in some music schools to hold a hanon marathon , in which the exercises are played competitively , the church street school for music and art being the first to have coined the term and hold the event .


== other works and derivatives ==
hanon also wrote 50 instructional pieces , méthode élémentaire de piano , and a collection of 50 ecclesiastical chants .
charles nunzio wrote hanon for accordion , a two-volume set of exercises for piano accordion based on a similar philosophy , which has recently been reissued in an updated edition .
a hanon for guitar and bass have also been written.an abbreviated , 60 second , version exists .

giuseppe ricciotti ( rome , 1890 – 1964 ) was an italian canon regular , biblical scholar and archeologist . he is famous mainly for his book the life of christ edited in 1941 and reedited and reprinted several times .


== life ==
ricciotti was born in rome on 27 february 1890 . in 1905 he entered the novitiate of the roman catholic religious order of the canons regular of the lateran , taking religious vows the following year . after his seminary studies and completing mandatory military service , he was ordained as a priest in 1913 . after ordination , ricciotti continued his studies at the university of rome , where he took courses in both philosophy and theology . at the same time he did coursework at the pontifical biblical institute .
during world war i he was required to interrupt his studies and to perform military service , during which time he served as a military chaplain , volunteering for service at the front lines , and was afterwards awarded a silver medal of military valor for his service in the trenches , where he was seriously wounded . because of this experience , he came to oppose any kind of war .
after the war , ricciotti resumed his studies and graduated in 1919 with a degree in biblical studies . from 1924 onwards , he taught hebrew literature at the university of rome . he also taught similar courses briefly at the university of genoa and at the university of bari , where he taught from 1935 to 1960 . in addition to this , ricciotti set up and directed a small seminary in liguria .
in 1935 he was appointed procurator general of his religious congregation . during world war ii , due to his office he was able to give refuge to many refugees at the congregation 's motherhouse at the basilica of st. peter in chains . during this period , he also served as a consultant to the vatican congregation for the clergy . he held this position for his congregation until 1946 , when he was named as the abbot of gubbio .
giuseppe ricciotti died in rome on 22 january 1964 .


== works ==
ricciotti 's first important work is storia d'israele ( english : history of israel ) , published in 1932 . in 1932 he also published bibbia e non bibbia ( english : bible and not bible ) where he supported the need to apply the higher criticism to the study of the bible , to be based on the original texts and not on the latin vulgate . in 1934 ricciotti took a stand against the increasing antisemitism publishing the translations in italian of sermons of cardinal michael von faulhaber in favour of the hebrews.the period in which he worked was one of deep suspicion of biblical studies in italy . as a result , ricciotti was partially involved in the late stages of the modernist crisis . he was attacked , along with his friend ernesto buonaiuti , by the most conservative catholic wing . differently from buonaiuti , his positions were finally judged not to be modernist , and he accepted criticism by the pontifical biblical commission to some of his works .
his masterpiece is vita di gesù cristo ( english : life of jesus christ ) , edited in 1941 and published many times . the scholar nicolotti writes : `` his works on biblical texts , of a rather conservative character , show a solid historical and philological training , not at all alien to the contemporary acquisitions of the critic . `` giuseppe ricciotti also wrote : la bibbia e le scoperte moderne ( english : the bible and modern discoveries ) , 1957 , and l'imperatore giuliano l'apostata secondo i documenti ( english : julian the apostate ) , 1958 . additionally , he edited a new translation into italian of the bible from the original texts .

== life ==
chance was born at edgbaston , in the city of birmingham , the son of alexander macomb chance and florence mercer . chance 's fraternal grandmother was cornelia de peyster , whose ancestors were dutch and huguenot settlers in british north america and loyalist to the crown . he was educated at trinity college , cambridge . he was a wealthy businessman and industrialist who managed the family chemicals business , chance and hunt , based in oldbury , west midlands , which provided chemicals to chance brothers , the famous glassmakers based in smethwick , birmingham , between the first and second world wars . he was an egg-collector who became fascinated by cuckoos and made intensive studies of the common cuckoo , in the course of which he wrote two books about the species as well as producing a film . the film , the cuckoo 's secret , was shot at pound green common in worcestershire , showing for the first time that female cuckoos lay their eggs directly into the nests of their hosts , rather than laying them on the ground and placing them in the nests with their bills as was previously widely believed . he also achieved a world record for collecting the most eggs – 25 – from a single female cuckoo in the course of one breeding season ( 1922 ) .chance was a member of the british ornithologists ' union – from which his egg collecting eventually resulted in his expulsion – and served on the council of the british oological association . he named his daughter cardamine , alluding to the scientific name of the cuckoo flower cardamine pratensis .
professor nick davies of cambridge university has described chance as one of his all time heroes and featured chance 's contribution to science in his book cuckoo.chance 's large egg collection , which includes the eggs of the cuckoo filmed at pound green common , is held at the natural history museum at tring.edgar chance 's elder brother kenneth macomb chance , sheriff of warwickshire in 1948 and founder of british industrial plastics , was also a keen egg-collector , forming between 1925 and 1938 a complete collection of warwickshire birds ' eggs which is now in the possession of his grandson.chance died at his home , age 74 , on 24 october 1955 .

== work ==


=== software engineering ===
shlaer started her software engineering career at los alamos national laboratory as a programmer . she designed and implemented an operating system to operate an electron accelerator to work in real time , and this project became her masterpiece.at lawrence berkeley laboratory , she led a team of software developers to build a new control system for the subway of the bay area rapid transit system . the existing control system software was considered impossible to continue using , making replacement necessary . working with steve mellor , they replaced the original fortran and assembly language code with new code , going from seventy thousand lines to two thousand . this analysis has since been called `` legendary `` .


=== shlaer–mellor method ===

in the developing of a new control system for the bay area rapid transit , shlaer and mellor sought to regulate mechanisms of software development and began to design new methods of project management . this resulted in the development of the shlaer–mellor method , which in the new millennium has evolved into executable uml .

julia barlow platt ( 14 september 1857 , in san francisco – 1935 ) was an american embryologist , politician and mayor .


== life ==
julia platt received her undergraduate degree from the university of vermont before moving to cambridge to perform research at the harvard annex in 1887 . during her time at harvard , she challenged the anti-coeducational policies in place . in 1889 , she left harvard to take courses and do research at woods hole , clark university , the university of chicago , bryn mawr , the university of freiberg , the naples zoological station , and the university of munich . she obtained her doctorate at freiburg in 1898 . she investigated embryogenesis , in particular the head development , from studying sharks and salamanders . her most notable contribution to the field was her demonstration that neural crest cells formed the jaw cartilage and tooth dentine in necturus maculosus ( mudpuppy embryos ) , but her work was not believed by her contemporaries . her claim went counter to the belief that only mesoderm could form bones and cartilage . her hypothesis of the neural crest origin of the cranial skeleton gained acceptance only some 50 years later when confirmed by sven hörstadius and sven sellman.unable to obtain a doctoral degree from radcliffe or secure a university position , she said `` if i can not obtain the work i wish , then i must take up with the next best `` and then became active in politics , including tearing down a fence to give the public access to the beach at lover 's point in pacific grove , california . in 1931 , at the age of 74 , she became mayor of pacific grove , california . according to steve palumbi and carolyn sotka , her prescient pioneering setting up of a marine protected area was crucial to the recovery of the sea otter .

william lutwiniak ( november 24 , 1919 – january 24 , 1992 ) was an american crossword constructor who was also known for his work as a cryptologist with the national security agency . he composed a total of 8,413 puzzles ; his first five thousand were composed between 1965 and 1985 , as a hobby .


== early life ==
lutwiniak was born in jersey city , new jersey . lutwiniak began solving crosswords when he was 12 , and sold his first puzzle to the new york herald-tribune when he was 15 ; he later considered that this puzzle had been `` a bit prophetic `` because it contained the word `` cryptographical `` . when he was 16 , he won a subscription to the journal of the american cryptogram association and also joined the national puzzlers ' league with the nom `` live devil `` . over the five years that followed , he was a regular participant in the aca 's activities , which brought him to the attention of william friedman ; friedman invited him to pursue advanced training in cryptography , and then to join the signal intelligence service , which lutwiniak did on february 1 , 1941 .

lutwiniak worked at arlington hall under solomon kullback until the aftermath of the attack on pearl harbor , at which point he became concerned that he would be drafted , so he went to the munitions building and asked colonel harold hayes for advice ; hayes told him to go to a particular recruiting station and enlist . lutwiniak did so , and was immediately assigned to work under harold hayes at the munitions building ; when he returned , hayes promoted him to sergeant so that he could skip basic training . by the following october , he had been promoted from staff sergeant to technical sergeant.during the war , lutwiniak stopped creating and solving crosswords `` because things were serious `` . in the mid-1960s , however , he found a margaret farrar crossword in a copy of the new york times , and discovered that he was not able to solve it as easily as he had expected ; he subsequently began selling crosswords to her . one of his early puzzles , which used cryptic crossword-style cluing such as `` center of gravity `` for `` avi `` and `` fourth of july `` for `` y `` , was so controversial ( creating , in lutwiniak 's words , a 'big uproar ' ) that the newspaper had to subsequently print an explanation of what the clues meant.in 1961 , he headed the nsa 's a5 unit , which specialized in soviet codes . later , he became the publisher of cryptolog , one of the nsa 's internal magazines , to which he also contributed articles and puzzles.in 1985 , he joined the washington post as crossword co-editor for their sunday magazine , and became more involved in crossword culture ; in 1987 , he attended a stanley newman-run crossword tournament in baltimore , and created a 15-by-15 puzzle on stage , in 15 minutes , based on suggestions from the audience .

hermann pokorny ( kroměříž , austro-hungarian empire , 1882–1960 , budapest , hungary ) was a world war i austro-hungarian army cryptologist whose work with russian ciphers contributed substantially to central powers victories over russia . he was a member of the hungarian order of vitéz .


== life ==
pokorny was born in moravia into a german-speaking family . his father was the postmaster of kroměříž . a cousin was major franciszek pokorny , a polish army officer who after world war i headed the polish general staff 's cipher bureau . in 1900 herman pokorny joined the k.u.k . austro-hungarian army . by 1918 , when the austro-hungarian empire fell , he was a lieutenant colonel .
during world war i , pokorny , as a cryptologist in the rank of major , headed the austro-hungarian general staff 's russian-cipher bureau . he showed great ability in decrypting russian enciphered military messages that were broadcast by radio in 1914–17 . he recognized that the russian cryptographers had reduced the 35-letter russian alphabet to 24 letters , while doubling the 11 missing letters to some of the other 24 letters . his break into the russian military cipher system enabled austro-hungarian and german forces to act in advance of impending russian maneuvers , thus contributing substantially to central powers victories over the russians . he is mentioned in soviet marshal boris shaposhnikov 's famous book , мозг армии ( the brain of the army , 1929 ) . for his services to cryptology , pokorny was decorated with the large military merit medal with swords in 1918 . founded on april 1 , 1916 , this honour was intended for the `` highest especially praiseworthy recognition `` and was awarded only 30 times . 28 of its recipients were officers of general 's rank ; the other two were the naval aviator gottfried von banfield ( 1916 ) and pokorny himself .
after world war i , as a german-language native speaker , pokorny did not request czechoslovak or austrian citizenship because he was not welcome in czechoslovakia on account of his german roots nor in austria because he had been born on czech soil . accordingly , in 1918 he joined the hungarian army and made his new life as a hungarian citizen . he was promoted to colonel in 1925 and retired in 1935 in the rank of major general .
during world war ii , he was not called up for military service . after the soviet red army captured budapest in 1945 , he volunteered to support hungary 's reconstruction . he worked for the foreign ministry ( 1945–49 ) . he went into his final retirement as a general , and died in budapest in 1960 .

in 1920 , with anatoly s. zimin , he developed a method to determine serum haemoglobin concentration by extracting the haemoglobin from water . it was the first biological blood test ( in blood tests or platelets ) to work completely without the use of a pregnant woman 's blood and without the presence of thrombin . this invention was later supplemented by developing on high-affinity dyeing reagents for the detection of blood pigments and by using the invention of the chartrometer , for measuring serum haemoglobin and erythrocyte bilirubin .


== achievements ==
in 1922 , gaytsev was among the first to devise and use an enzymatic assay of enzyme concentrations to evaluate the alpha-helical acid levels of alpha-hemoglobin.he was among the first to develop methods for determining the blood levels of prothrombin by dissection of isolated liver contents . the method , implemented in 1922 , provided additional insight into the clinical use of the antihypertensive-like medication statins .
in the early 1930s , gaytsev developed the gaytsev test for the test for platelet therapy based on the discovery of a new serum fragment derived from an infected lesion of the prostate gland .

= emanuel sperner =
emanuel sperner ( 9 december 1905 – 31 january 1980 ) was a german mathematician , best known for two theorems . he was born in waltdorf ( near neiße , upper silesia , now nysa , poland ) , and died in sulzburg-laufen , west germany . he was a student at carolinum in nysa and then hamburg university where his advisor was wilhelm blaschke . he was appointed professor in königsberg in 1934 , and subsequently held posts in a number of universities until 1974 .
sperner 's theorem , from 1928 , says that the size of an antichain in the power set of an n-set ( a sperner family ) is at most the middle binomial coefficient ( s ) . it has several proofs and numerous generalizations , including the sperner property of a partially ordered set .
sperner 's lemma , from 1928 , states that every sperner coloring of a triangulation of an n-dimensional simplex contains a cell colored with a complete set of colors . it was proven by sperner to provide an alternate proof of a theorem of lebesgue characterizing dimensionality of euclidean spaces . it was later noticed that this lemma provides a direct proof of the brouwer fixed-point theorem without explicit use of homology.sperner 's students included kurt leichtweiss and gerhard ringel .

edwin butterworth ( 1 october 1812 – 19 april 1848 ) was an english topographer , writer on local history , and journalist . he is known particularly as a researcher for edward baines 's history of lancashire .


== life ==
butterworth was the tenth and youngest child of the topographer james butterworth , and was born at pitses , near oldham , in 1812 . he followed in the footsteps of his father , whom he assisted in his later works , but was more given to statistical research . when edward baines undertook the preparation of a history of lancashire , he found a useful colleague in edwin butterworth , who visited many parts of the county in order to collect the requisite particulars.during the six years in which he was engaged by edward baines he travelled on foot through nearly every town and village in the county . his own notes and those of his father formed a large mass of manuscript material . later researchers have noted that butterworth not only provided material for baines 's history of lancashire , but also , without acknowledgement , wrote most of the text.he wrote local history books , which produced little remuneration ; his main income was as a journalist , acting as correspondent for several manchester newspapers . he was for a considerable time registrar of births and deaths for the township of chadderton.in 1847 butterworth conceived the idea of publishing a history of lancashire in fifty volumes , based on his extensive notes ; each volume , while part of the general series , would also be complete in itself . this project was encouraged by the earl of ellesmere . overtures were made to samuel bamford , as it was thought that his pleasant style and butterworth 's facts would make a popular combination . the suggestion was roughly treated by the earl , and butterworth 's death occurred before such a plan could have been completed.he is described by those who knew him as genial and modest . butterworth died , unmarried , of typhoid fever on 19 april 1848 . he was buried at greenacres cemetery in oldham , and in 1859 a monument to his memory was erected there by public subscription . such of his books and manuscripts ( including material inherited from his father ) as had not been accidentally dispersed were purchased by the platt brothers , and by them presented to the town . they are now in oldham local studies and archives .

= william fielding rutherford =
william fielding rutherford frse lld ( 1869–1944 ) was an english scientist , mathematician , and astronomer .


== life ==
rutherford was born in london on 10 october 1869 . he studied philosophy at the university of cambridge under samuel alcock , graduating bsc in 1880 . he was appointed lecturer in the natural philosophy department of the royal college of physicians in 1883 and graduated msc in 1884 . he then returned to england to take up a professorial post at the university of cambridge ( bsc , 1887 ) and subsequently to dean 's school of music at aberdeen , where he was appointed a lecturer in 1894 . he served as head of the department of mathematics and astronomy from 1899 until his retirement in 1927 .


== publications ==
rutherford was among the leaders of the cambridge mathematical society , and his papers are housed at the cambridge science library . his letters and papers on the equilibrium of atomic masses in 1918 , the following year , he wrote a much anticipated paper , `` the equilibrium of aqueous hydrogen-hepatic mixtures `` , in which he conjectured that the final state for a gas molecule to become hot was likely to be what is sometimes called a liquid state , where the density of hydrogen in the form of oxygen is maximized ; this form would at least approximate the state of equilibrium.in 1910 rutherford 's investigation into the chemical character of the ozone produced his paper a treatise on the chemistry of the atmosphere , and it was largely in this paper that rutherford first proposed the idea of an `` upper boundary `` for the ozone layer . while most scientists assumed that the upper boundary was negligible , he postulated that the higher a region of the atmosphere the more saturation it would have , and that the thickest atmosphere was the best ground for the formation of ozone .
in 1917 rutherford set off on a nine-year european exploration of the earth , accompanied by the explorer edwin chadwick and ernest shackleton , which culminated in rutherford 's publication , the day before it went to space ( oxford university press , 1920 ) . the initial aim of the exploration was to gather information on the elements of the solar system , but it also sought to develop the understanding of the solar system 's orbit , and to determine the position of the sun . he visited the lunar surface , visits a number of other planets and asteroids , and visited several moons .
in 1925 rutherford discovered what he referred to as `` the tiny beautiful nickel `` , which he named van allen . in 1927 he reported discovering the triple-star alpha v on the left side of the far side of the earth .


== legacy ==
an asteroid 14209 rutherford discovered in 1929 is named in his honour . a crater on the moon is named for him . in 2010 , the international astronomical union announced that rutherford had won the nobel prize in physics . his planetary observations were featured in the film galileo , starring will smith , alongside nobel laureate john gerard . in addition , several large satellite observatories are named in his honour .

cornell 's descendants owned much land in rockaway , much of which was partitioned into 46 parcels in 1820 , which were eventually sold to outsiders , and their property was still being sold even in the late 19th century , as for example the sale of the land comprising the present-day neighborhood of bayswater to william trist bailey in 1878 .
the cornell homestead by the beachfront was later the site of the marine pavilion .

= georg schuller =
georg schuller ( 11 march 1879 – 25 october 1952 ) was a german psychiatrist and psychotherapist who pioneered psychoanalytic psychotherapy in germany .


== biography ==
georg schuller was born on 11 march 1879 in baden , german empire . from 1883 to 1891 , he studied at the gymnasium in bonn , before transferring to the university of bonn in 1890 to further his studies and obtaining a doctorate in medicine ( doctorphilosophie ) in 1893 . in 1890 , he returned to his native germany , where he taught at the university of würzburg , where he received a postdoctoral fellowship in psychology from august fischer . in 1896 , he became a visiting professor at the university of halle . he returned to bonn to become a full professor in 1900 , and served as the head of the department of psychology at the university until 1919 .
in 1900 , schuller published psychoanalysis der beziehung des katholischefskonferenzens ( psychoanalysis of the object of sexual repression ) , in which he set forth what is still considered to be one of the most influential theories of psychoanalysis in the 20th century . psychoanalysts at the time were working on their works in recognition of the `` critical theory `` of psychoanalysis . psychoanalysts thought this concept of criticism to show that psychoanalysis was a genuine investigation of the subject , providing a solution to the question of his relation to the world . he became famous in germany as a leader in the integration of psychoanalytic psychology into mainstream psychology . schuller proved that freud and other “ more conservative ” theorists was able to express their conclusions coherently within a priori analytical conditions . in psychoanalysis der beziehung des katholischefskonferenzens , schuller linked psychoanalysis to scientific method as outlined by freud , thereby starting a chain of dialog between psychoanalysts and psychoanalysts . psychoanalysts had spent more than 100 years trying to find an understanding of the concept of the 'object of repression'through an analytical framework of his.in 1901 , schuller published an essay `` subjective and objective control : also `` ( 1907 ) that he wrote about his approach to the subject . he argued that the more one attempts to control oneself , the more suffering that he will experience . he also argued that there is no contradiction between psychological processes that are self-reproducing and psychological processes that are self-destructive . these theories were well known at the time and schuller continued to work on them after his retirement .

in the 1920s and 1930s , psychoanalysts such as philipp riesenbach , hans bülow , and georg philipp engelbrecht devoted their time to the study of psychoanalysis . schuller , schüll , and emil kraepelin founded a movement known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy in the 1930s . as his research and teaching became more influential , schuller himself became known as the “ creator of psychoanalysis ” , “ one of the most influential scientists in german psychoanalysis `` , and “ one of the most original and versatile therapists in the field `` . he is considered the father of the modern psychoanalysis .
in 1942 , schuller was arrested by the gestapo for attempting to disseminate `` schadenfreude `` in german mass culture . after the war , his writings were published as archiv für psychoanalytische psychologie , and were republished after the war .

[ and ] his accuracy in practically every instance `` . it is impossible to estimate the quality of his argumentation , but his work is remarkable for its lucid exposition of important issues , and it appears , as one may expect , to be an effortless refresher for anyone attempting to answer similar questions in the past .

léonardi was the author of the méthode pour banjoline ou mandoline-banjo ( method for banjolin and mandolin-banjo ) . the book was rare among texts teaching mandolin , because it taught his method in three languages at once , english , french and spanish . in the third edition of his mandolin-banjo method ( 1921 ) , he stated in the introduction that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times . in writing his book , he noted the instrument was soaring in popularity in the shape of the banjo . he did not just recycle old material for his book , but also included his own compositions , including souvenir de malta , caminando ( a tango ) , souvenir de rome , un beso por teléfono , qui-pro-quo , rêverie , and capriccio ( a polka ) .as a music teacher , léonardi was unsure of whether to include jazz in his book , saying he thought it a faddish style of playing that might not be around very long . in spite of his speculation , he chose to include the section on how to play jazz , noting that he had played with american jazz bands after world war i.he is known for composing souvenir de catania , souvenir de napoli , souvenir de sicile , and angeli e demoni .

abraham darby , in his lifetime called abraham darby the younger , referred to for convenience as abraham darby ii ( 12 may 1711 – 31 march 1763 ) was the second man of that name in an english quaker family that played an important role in the early years of the industrial revolution .


== life ==
darby was born in coalbrookdale , shropshire to abraham and mary ( née sergeant ) .
he followed in his father 's footsteps in the darby foundry business in coalbrookdale , producing cast iron cooking pots , kettles , and other goods . the coalbrookdale company also played an important role in using iron to replace the more expensive brass for cylinders for thomas newcomen 's steam engines .
he and his partners were responsible for a very important innovation in introducing the use of coke pig iron as the feedstock for finery forges . this formed a significant part of the output of horsehay and ketley furnaces , which they built in the late 1750s . his father 's successful use of coke pig iron as foundry feedstock , and his own success in using it as forge feedstock were two of the steps towards the industrial revolution for the iron industry , but the final breakthrough that permitted the great expansion of iron production that constitutes the industrial revolution for it came later .
he died aged 51 . he had married twice : firstly margaret smith ( died 1740 ) , with whom he had three children including hannah who married richard reynolds , and secondly the quaker minister abiah maude , with whom he had a further thirteen children although only four including abraham darby iii survived .

michel matthew ter-pogossian ( april 21 , 1925 – june 19 , 1996 ) was an armenian-american nuclear physicist who is one of the fathers of positron emission tomography ( pet ) , the first functional brain imaging technology . pet could effectively be used to evaluate what areas of the brain were active during various mental processes versus looking at the structure of the brain through conventional ct .
ter-pogossian was born in berlin , the only child of armenian parents who had settled in germany after escaping the armenian genocide during world war i . the family moved to france when michel was a young child . during world war ii , he fought with the french resistance . he earned degrees in science from the university of paris and from the institute of radium . in 1946 , he emigrated to the united states to attend washington university of st. louis ; he later joined the faculty of washington university school of medicine . he was married in 1966 to ann scott dodson and had three children and six grandchildren .
pet scanning is one of the most promising techniques for cancer detection and has applications in monitoring heart disease . the development of new radioligands may allow more uses of positron emission tomography for other areas in medicine .
the technique uses the injection of ultrashort acting radioactive substances commonly bound to water or deoxyglucose . the deoxyglucose method directly measures brain metabolism whereas the radioactively labeled water is effective at measuring brain blood flow .

== early life ==
margaret frank was born margaret cook on 24 july 1916 , in chester , wiltshire , england , where she lived with her sister , jane 's daughter , irene . she was a first cousin to the british novelist arthur rackham frank.when frank was 11 , her mother passed away , leaving her cousin with the responsibility of taking care of the boys . eventually frank worked as a seamstress in wicklow before enrolling in trinity college , cambridge . she began taking aquatic physiology classes while at college . her main interests were wildlife , including hunting and fisheries.after graduating in 1925 , frank spent a year in the u.s. working for the u.s . fish and wildlife service . while working at the agency she met maurice goldrick , an entomologist who later studied aquatic parasites in freshwater fish ( 1942 ) , providing her with a critical mass of material she would use in her later work .


== career ==
during world war ii frank began work as a researcher at the university of toronto . she became interested in the methods of entomology as a science , giving up a more settled career in veterinary medicine . she joined the division of fisheries science and started the fish-disease system at the british board of fisheries ( bnf ) at cambridge.working as a lecturer , frank started on a series of papers dealing with planktonids and other biota of the northern barrier . her papers on these topics were published in the british journal of science in 1949 and 1950 , the health of freshwater fisheries ( 1952 ) and on the freshwater parasite ( 1955 ) , all of which documented findings from sea waters collected in cape york .
after completing a phd in zoology at the university of cambridge , frank left the bnf in 1963 to become a researcher at the fisheries biosecurity research unit of the uk government . her research on parasitic animal diseases and their treatment , which was carried out with an emphasis on freshwater plankton and salamanders , eventually led to a national research council fellowship . she completed a number of papers and published research in both fish and fisheries and the journals of natural history . from 1979 to 1985 , frank was director of the department of agriculture biological sciences division of a consortium to study how environmental contaminants and toxins in the uk 's freshwater fisheries impact the ecology and functioning of british ecosystems .
frank 's research focused on the morphology , structure and ecology of freshwater creatures , specifically freshwater algae , plankton and trilobites . this work revealed a host of potential new taxa for study , for example , freshwater thallids ( gehirnidae ) , which she identified as having a `` symbiotic , cross-bridging relationship with thallid larvae , and small thallid fish and worms `` . frank also recorded many other biological studies , focusing on the microbial ecology and ecology of freshwater organisms.between 1984 and 1990 , frank chaired the advisory committee of the 2013 english riviera marine science festival . she was also president of the general welfare research committee of the national society of birdwatchers and a member of the society of marine ecology.the standard author abbreviation m. frank is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .


== legacy ==
the geography of trilobites ( now the geography of thallids and monocotyls ) is a book of textbooks on cytology . the staff of the antarctic institute for marine ecology and conservation has listed it on their website as one of their ten most influential books of the 20th century , which it is . the book was used as the basis of brookley c. denison 's research on the thallididae of the antarctic .

= otto kuntze =
carl ernst otto kuntze ( 23 june 1843 – 27 january 1907 ) was a german botanist .


== biography ==
otto kuntze was born in leipzig .
an apothecary in his early career , he published an essay entitled pocket fauna of leipzig . between 1863 and 1866 he worked as tradesman in berlin and traveled through central europe and italy . from 1868 to 1873 he had his own factory for essential oils and attained a comfortable standard of living . between 1874 and 1876 , he traveled around the world : the caribbean , united states , japan , china , south east asia , arabian peninsula and egypt . the journal of these travels was published as `` around the world `` ( 1881 ) . from 1876 to 1878 he studied natural science in berlin and leipzig and gained his doctorate in freiburg with a monography of the genus cinchona .
he edited the botanical collection from his world voyage encompassing 7,700 specimens in berlin and kew gardens . the publication came as a shock to botany , since kuntze had entirely revised taxonomy . his three-volume treatise , revisio generum plantarum ( 1891 ) was widely rejected or deliberately ignored .
in 1886 , kuntze visited the russian near east and spent the 1887–88 period on the canary islands . the results of both journeys became part of his main work , the revisio . at the beginning of the 1890s he left for south america , of which he managed to see nearly all countries . in 1894 , he visited the southern african countries as well as the german colonies . in the last years of his life , kuntze moved permanently to sanremo ( italy ) .
although he stated that he was merely diligently applying standard practice , his revolutionary ideas about botanic nomenclature created a schism between competing sets of rules of botanical nomenclature , the precursors of the modern international code of nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants . the conflict came to a head at the 2nd international botanical congress in 1905 , two years before kuntze 's death . his uncompromising responses to differing views meant that the doors of much of the academic world , particularly in europe , were closed to him.kuntze 's work cast a strong light on the inadequacy of previous approaches to botanical nomenclature . a group of american botanists developed an alternative set of rules , the rochester code , which they proposed in 1892 as an alternative to the international rules . this schism was not resolved until 1930 .

= william nicol ( geologist ) =
dr william nicol frse fcs ( 18 april 1770 – 2 september 1851 ) was a scottish geologist and physicist who invented the nicol prism , the first device for obtaining plane-polarized light , in 1828 .


== early life ==
nicol was born in humbie ( east lothian ) in 1770 , the son of walter nicol and marion fowler . according to the parish register , he was baptised on 18 april 1770 . some sources ( including his gravestone ) give his date of birth as 1766 .


== lecturer ==
he started out as aide to his uncle , henry moyes , an itinerant lecturer in natural philosophy whose blindness necessitated assistance for his chemistry and optics demonstrations . nicol , having himself become a popular lecturer on that subject at the university of edinburgh , settled in edinburgh to live a very retired life . he conducted extensive studies of fluid inclusions in crystals and the microscopic structure of fossil wood . he did not publish any of his research findings until 1826 .


== nicol prism ==

nicol made his prism by bisecting a parallelepiped of iceland spar ( a naturally occurring , transparent crystalline form of calcium carbonate ) along its shortest diagonal , then cementing the two halves together with canada balsam . light entering the prism is refracted into two rays , one of which emerges as plane-polarized light . nicol prisms greatly facilitated the study of refraction and polarization , and were later used to investigate molecular structures and optical activity of organic compounds .


== rock sections ==
in 1815 , nicol developed a method of preparing extremely thin sections of crystals and rocks for microscopical study . he hit upon the plan of cutting sections of fossil wood , so as to reveal its minutest vegetable structures under a microscope . he took a slice from the specimen to be studied , ground it perfectly flat , polished it , and cemented it by means of canada balsam to a piece of plate-glass . the exposed surface of the slice was then ground down , until the piece of stone was reduced to a thin pellicle adhering to the glass , and the requisite degree of transparency was obtained . his technique made it possible to view mineral samples by transmitted rather than reflected light and therefore enabled the minerals ' internal structures to be seen . nicol prepared a large number of slices of fossil and recent woods . many of these were described by henry witham in his observations of fossil vegetables ( 1831 ) , to which nicol supplied the first published account of the process.when nicol died , his instruments and preparations passed to alexander bryson , who made many additions to the collections and made numerous thin slices of minerals and rocks for the purpose of exhibiting the cavities containing fluid , which had been described long before by david brewster and nicol .


== death and legacy ==
he died at his home , 4 inverleith terrace in edinburgh ( now renumbered 12 inverleith terrace ) on the 2 september 1851 , and was buried in warriston cemetery . his burial site is now marked by a plaque on the east wall , north of the sealed eastern gate .
dorsum nicol on the moon is named after him .

he studied drawing and painting , at the école nationale supérieure d'histoire naturelle , paris , and became a pupil of gustave gillet . in 1850 he established himself as a solo artist with a mostly professional artistic career . his work in landscape and portrait illustrations was accompanied by scientific research about the flora and fauna of corsica and africa .


=== wanderings ===

demarquise collected and developed large collections of forest trees and other exotic plants . among his most well-known works are the famous prints for the
1893 camille saint-saëns classic of the same name . in july 1889 demarquise accompanied saint-saëns on a four-month expedition through the tropics , when , upon reaching venezuela and then the guayaquil desert , he abandoned his camera and set up his camera equipment in the natura , the oldest indigenous home in the town . demarquise 's studio was devoted to his flora , which was the center of his artistic life . this project is now often regarded as the beginning of a decades-long association between nature and art .


=== relocation ===
as a result of his ornithological work , in 1902 demarquise decided to relocate to mérida , to which he was then destined for the next 50 years . he suffered as a result . his wife died in 1917 , and his other children left his village . the family lived in exile in mérida , where he spent the rest of his life .

= pablo astruc ( philosopher ) =
pablo astruc ( september 15 , 1927 – january 2 , 2002 ) was a philosopher , humanist and the founder of postmodern philosophy , and a world-renowned classical music critic .


== biography ==
astruc was born in argentina to an ethnic armenian family . he earned his ph.d. in philosophy in 1954 from the university of buenos aires . he studied philosophy at universidad autónoma de méxico , where he obtained his doctorate in 1978 . since then , astruc was a renowned philosopher and in 1977 became a reader of philosophy at the university of buenos aires . astruc 's views on philosophy , especially his rejection of sui generis cognitive knowledge , led to some controversy . he was most notable for his books critique of modern philosophy ( 1984 ) , criticism of the modern city ( 1992 ) , critique of modern art ( 1993 ) and history of modern philosophy ( 1995 ) . astruc advocated for a historical critical view of history , for the reappraising of classical philosophy .
in 1980 , he became editor of the journal philosophia seminarorum ( philosophy seminar ) . a number of prominent historical philosophers , including carl scheler , guido schmitt , david henderson , frank peirce , john dewey , harold m. chalmers , thomas hobbes , and j . b. s. haldane , he influenced were to write books on this theme.he died in 2001 of pancreatic cancer .


== works ==
astruc 's main book , critique of modern philosophy , argued that critical thinking should be open and participatory , that it seeks `` to find on the ground what is important `` , and in particular that it should search for `` the deep-seated myth of identity `` . ( ... ) such a myth can no longer be entertained by any rational author.the book developed `` a fundamental critique of plato and aristotle , of kant , hegel , and his allies , who argued for idealist values that led us to trouble-shoot thoroughly the ontological basis of society , instead of proceeding from the abstract analysis of the actual situation , dealing with its origins and consequences. `` it argued for the replacement of the realism of historical materialism with `` ontological materialism `` . astruc said that `` ( we ) need to atone for our flippantness for `` wanting answers that could 'be understood `` , i.e. , problems that might make out our position as idealist . `` for another of astruc 's books , the meaning of reality , he argued that `` being reality itself , physics and culture are fundamentally unlike any other scientific field .... they need to be seen to serve our very survival , not some vague aspiration to a pure and simply perfect body of knowledge. `` also for another of astruc 's books , expression and reality ( 1988 ) , which he called `` the philosophical basis of existentialism , epistemology , and aesthetics `` , he held that reality itself should stand behind human thought , philosophy and science . also for another of astruc 's books , the right to be free ( 1993 ) , he argued that freedom is not only the duty of individuals , but also that it belongs to all human beings.for more , see list of works by pablo astruc.of particular note is astruc 's 1996 book criticism of the modern city , a critical synthesis of postmodernism and classical aesthetics . according to campbell clark , `` astruc 's concern was with the most prosaic problem in contemporary life : the clash between a novelistic view of the world with the non-literary conception of history . it was a novelistic view that was doing serious harm to some small but growing numbers of well-educated , middle-class argentineans , and astruc 's account of that clash was a fitting antidote for the naïve , often despairing attitude that really counts for more in contemporary world history than any individual 's particular life circumstances . `` he also wrote the short story `` note da pío , `` which was read in an english-language festival in new york city in 2005 .
astruc wrote about the problems of domination in a popular culture in a book the new aristotelianism .

== life ==
he was born in vendôme , the son of jean and joanne marie-édouard marie-hubert cuvier . after his father 's death , the family moved to paris , where hippolyte attended school in the marais and studied physics at the école des mines from 1846 until 1853 . in 1854 , he was admitted to the physics department of the école polytechnique , where he remained until 1861 . after joining the école polytechnique , he worked in 1871 in geneva , starting his studies of the properties of gases . in 1872 , he became head of the bureau des elephants du turin , and the following year took up the chair of relativity at the university of paris . he returned to paris in 1873 , became director of the royal observatory of europe and occupied a position in the board of education of the university . in 1876 , he published la cour de l'usage ( on the surface of a magnetic field ) . from 1886 to 1896 , cuvier was a professor of physics at the ecole polytechnique , and died of apoplexy on 9 may 1879 , age 50 .


== scientific achievements ==
his contributions to experimental physics include the measurement of magnetic field with a reflection tube , and the cuvier equation of planetary motion . in 1873 , he invented the classical magneto-mechanical scale , which has been known as the cuvier scale . in 1874 , he suggested the idea that the type of metals in an electron 's path was the only determinant of its motion . cuvier was also an early astronomer , pointing out several asteroids in 1869 that were crescent-shaped in the opposite sign of the ecliptic .


== later life ==
in 1872 , cuvier published a large text of mathematical analysis with applications to electrical systems and was appointed professor of electrical and mechanical engineering at the university of the neuchâtel . in 1889 , the école polytechnique awarded him the prix de rome and awarded him the order of leopold ( knight commander of the legion of honor ) in 1892 , and the marie curie medal in 1904 . in 1914 , he was elected as a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences .

in 2004 , the moscow state university 's state academy of sciences awarded him the title of physicist-in-residence . since 1996 he served as chairman of the `` department of mathematics , cast `` , which is dedicated to scientific research in applied mathematics . the `` russkaya socivodnik `` magazine named him as a member of the `` state academy of sciences. ``
in 1999 he received the order of the badge of the red banner of labor .
in june 2016 , the `` kremlin commemoration `` of `` st. petersburg , soviet union `` on his grave in the cemetery in allushkina was proclaimed by the interior ministry.in the russian newspaper svoboda he wrote : `` if someone wanted to find my ideals of using a machine to measure all dynamics of extremely small problems , this situation and how danilevskii not only started this task can be known to him : ok , let 's listen to what works . here comes something special . this is a machine that can solve this problem , that is to say , he helped pioneer the advancement of the problem of liquid crystals . his decisive step in this goal was very easy : he just used the greatest practical machine ( for instance , a toy turbo-converter ) . this was nothing special , but nevertheless it was done to a very strong and most simple mechanical conclusion . how brilliant ! ``


== works ==

in the course of the 1936–1949 he worked on the hypothesis of quadratic group properties . in 1938 , he constructed an orthogonal group , which was the first non-kriging orthogonal group . in the following year , he completed another group which became the basis of the project on mergesort invariants for orthogonal groups . in 1957 , the result of his thesis about solvable solver for orthogonal groups was proved . in 1958 , he obtained one of the first results on the number of triples which are equal to ( π/2 , π ) . he discovered the suspension principle of pentagons , and in 1964 proved that a bipartite plane with ( r , r ) plane of rationals perpendicular to each other has a normal , say , area equal to the quantity that is the sum of the surface area of the plane and the surface area of an ordinary polygon .

danilevskii also worked on the proof of the composition of a p-algebraoid in solution of the algebraic group problem . this group was the basis for later groups in classical algebras . he used generalised richardson 's methods to prove properties of polynomials on topologies and homotopy classes . also in the context of certain solvable solver he demonstrated the value of a polynomial over the recurrence field ( chebyshev rule ) .
in 1958–59 , his major work was published on linear algebraic functions and proof of integrals . this series contains the most famous paper , in which he proved fermat 's last theorem . in 1962 , he gave the classic postulate of equivariant calculus . he also did work on error theory , including the unsolved problems in poisson curve approximation .
danilevskii continued in an important line of work involving properties of commutative rings . for example , the optical lines of commutative rings with congruent for all the coefficients of the ring are associated to a characteristic continuum in a continuum space . his most important work concerns the analysis of continuum morphisms of commutative rings . he pioneered the concept of linkage of rings in continuum space .

bernard david davis ( january 7 , 1916 – january 14 , 1994 ) was an american biologist who made major contributions in microbial physiology and metabolism . davis was a prominent figure at harvard medical school in microbiology and in national science policy . he was the 1989 recipient of the selman a. waksman award in microbiology from the national academy of sciences .


== education ==
davis was born in franklin , massachusetts , where his parents , jewish immigrants from lithuania , had settled . ( davis himself was nonobservant , and `` insisted on atheism `` . ) he was valedictorian at his high school , then attended harvard university , where he majored in biochemistry . after earning his bachelor of science degree , he enrolled at harvard medical school , graduating in 1940 with a rare m.d . , summa cum laude . he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1958 . in a front-note to a posthumously published commentary that appeared in 2000 , the major contributions of davis to microbial physiology has been noted as , `` the use of penicillin for the selection of auxotrophic mutants and his u-tube experiment to prove that bacterial conjugation required direct contact between the two bacterial strains . ``


== moralistic fallacy ==
in a short article published in nature in 1978 , davis coined the term `` moralistic fallacy `` after calls for ethical guidelines to control the study of what could allegedly become `` dangerous knowledge . `` the term was intended as a converse to the naturalistic fallacy , a term coined by g.e . moore in the early twentieth century but often applied to certain related views of david hume in the eighteenth century . hume pointed out the logical fallacy that occurs when deductive reasoning jumps from statements about what is to prescriptions about what ought to be . davis thus referred to the `` moralistic fallacy `` as `` in effect , an illogical effort to derive an 'is ' from an 'ought ' . ``
sometimes a theory is rejected with a reference to the danger of misuse . in doing so , one fails to differentiate sufficiently clearly between its epistemological value and its practical value , or between the moral , value-free knowledge and – in consideration of moral valuations – the potentially negative consequences of the knowledge . from a perspective of scientific theory , the accuracy of a theory is relevant , not its practical value , its origin or history of use . no theory is protected against misuse , nor can a theory be falsified by misuse . both misuse as well as renunciation of knowledge can have disadvantageous consequences .
an example of the naturalistic fallacy would be approving of all wars if scientific evidence showed warfare was part of human nature , whereas an example of the moralistic fallacy would be claiming that , because warfare is wrong , it can not be part of human nature .


== on scientific writing ==
on the current format of scientific writing , davis had opined , `` a scientific paper is an unusual art form . it has to be as compact as possible , while giving the reader all the information needed to repeat the experiments . because the literature is vast , the format of a paper is standardized so the reader can quickly find the parts that interest him ; readers skim most of the papers that they look at , except those very close to their interests . the aim is efficient , impersonal transmission of the essentials , rather than a narrative account of the steps along the way . ``

david joseph grossman ( december 3 , 1901 – july 14 , 1980 ) was a noted american mathematician and physicist . he also became one of the world 's leading mathematicians of his era , as well as a noted performer and a player in hollywood .


== education and career ==

david grossman was born on december 3 , 1901 , to french parents in new york city , the son of paul grossman , a physician , and his wife sallie brande baron-sébastien . he was educated at new york university and the city college of new york , graduating phi beta kappa in 1925 , the highest honor awarded to a student in that school . from 1926 to 1928 , he received a b.s . in mathematics and physics from columbia university .
in 1930 , he enrolled at the massachusetts institute of technology as an electrical engineer . upon his graduation from mit in 1932 , he became a full professor at caltech in 1937 and , subsequently , was promoted to full professor in 1943 , becoming director of the national bureau of standards in 1942 and cofounder of the national institute of standards in 1943 .


=== film career ===
grossman directed , among other films , the 1933 film plane crazy ( an adaptation of french theoretical physicist émile durkheim 's we make the sky ) and two short films : cradle to grave ( 1944 ) and the grey lady ( 1944 ) , both about the nature of suicide in american childhood . the former , based on ernst haeckel 's memoirs , was filmed in the new jersey suburbs , where he lived for most of his life .
the latter was set in remote and isolated appalachian caves , and was based on the 1947 play the blue man of fancy . the latter , based on the fictional story of the author 's son , maurice , was based on the 1949 play black lips . both films starred samuel west as the title character and drew criticism from both the motion picture association of america ( mpaa ) and the director roy rogers for displaying the very essence of the moviewright 's sentiments : the film was `` an absolute triumph of trying and failing to be unreal `` .
grossman was a noted actor . in the grey lady , he played the title role , the illegitimate son of the father of the protagonist 's twin . the film 's success made it possible for him to relocate to the united states . he was in contract at the time of his death to direct the 1963 version of crash ( intended to recapture his strong reputation as a screenwriter ) , but it was not a success .


== oscar recognition and endorsement ==
in 1927 , after attending the first international technical congress in his native switzerland , grossman won the election to the american physical society . his acceptance speech contained a set of syntheses of a. n. t. peierls 's and john von neumann 's ideas about the field of information theory , much of which was much in agreement with his own , and suggested that a fully quantum theory could be of use in computational physics . the speech had a profound effect on grossman 's scientific future and on the scientific literature on quantum theory .


== personal life ==
he married caryl a. s. galperman , a scientist from montana who was a close friend of his , in 1923 . she would become a leading figure in film . they had two children , the inventor david galperman and the mathematician and actress celeste allen garber . both daughters have also worked on education issues .

prikhot'ko was accepted to the leningrad polytechnical institute in 1923 and graduated in 1929 . still as a junior , she started research on spectroscopy under the supervision of ivan v. obreimov , and finally earned a phd in this field under his guidance . in 1930 , she moved to the newly established kharkov institute of physics and technology for working with obreimov on low-temperature spectroscopy of molecular crystals , a field pioneered by him , in the first in the ussr cryogenic laboratory created by lev shubnikov . this research was primary focused on comparing the spectra of vapors and crystals of weakly interacting molecules that at low temperature manifest a number of narrow bands due to the freezing-out the thermal motion of molecules . in this way obreimov and prikhot'ko investigated a wide class of inorganic and organic molecular crystals and detected optically low-temperature transitions between their different phases . the principal technical advances were in taking absorption spectra in polarized light and measuring dispersion , including the anomalous dispersion near the absorption lines , at low temperatures . during wwii prikhot'ko worked in the city of ufa where a number of institutions of the ukrainian academy of sciences was evacuated . since 1944 prikhot'ko worked in kiev , in the institute of physics , where here husband , a prominent soviet nuclear physicist aleksandr leipunskii , was appointed as a director . there she established a division of the physics of crystals .
the principal discovery of prikhot'ko was published in her 1944 paper based on the experimental data collected still in kharkov , and in her 1948 follow-up paper . she reported the discovery in the absorption spectra of monocrystals of naphthalene two new bands that were polarized along the symmetry axes of the crystal , as distinct from the majority of bands that there present in both components of the spectrum at the same frequencies . because individual molecules in crystalline naphthalene are tilted with respect to the crystal axes , existence of strongly polarized absorption bands proved unambiguously that electronic excitation is not localized at individual molecules but propagates across the crystal . prikhot'ko ' discovery stimulated development of davydov ' theory of molecular excitons for crystals including several molecules in a unit cell . while existence of excitons was predicted previously by yakov frenkel and afterwards by gregory wannier and nevill mott , prikhot'ko ' was the first convincing experimental discovery of excitons . the follow-up experiments on low-temperature spectra of benzine crystals confirmed agreement between the theory and experiment .
during the following years prikhot'ko and her collaborators investigated spectra of a number of crystals , and her personal favorite has been crystalline oxygen where electronic excitations combine with magnetic ones .
since 1965 prikhot'ko served as a director of the institute of physics of the national academy of sciences of ukraine . she was awarded a lenin prize for her scientific achievements and a title of a hero of socialist labor .

pablo turpin ( august 7 , 1911 – march 20 , 2000 ) was an argentine physicist , important for his work on infrared spectroscopy , crystallography and color discrimination . he was also a pioneering rationalist and élite theorist .
turpin 's own father was a descendant of spanish conquerors of veracruz in the time of francisco de rojas and another ancestor of the banker manuel de castro y amerigo y almeida , who was a founding member of the new spain . turpin was born in isabela , who was called chegaju-gran , but used turpin as the last name of his surname . after graduating from the university of buenos aires , he enrolled in the faculty of physics in 1923 . turpin taught briefly at the pontifical military academy .
in 1938 , the berlin government enacted legislation which classified science from the academic fields of mechanics and metallurgy into two national zones . this restricted research and allowed only teachers to pursue their specialties . that year , the government finally abolished this law , but provided turpin with a special exemption allowing him to continue working in the buenos aires scientific community . after this he returned to argentina and took up the post of the director of the institute of physics of the university of buenos aires , later known as the universidad cervantes . at this time , he worked on pioneering spectral lines and wrote a series of important papers on the calibration of spectroscopic instruments . he developed color recognition tests for the color vision of children .
in 1949 he married valeria teoh , a native of ríocelo . the same year he was awarded an honorary degree from the university of buenos aires . his main contributions were to the self-model of spectroscopy and for the design of the radiometric spectrograph.turbin died in buenos aires , aged 86 , but left a small number of letters to his students . among these were a selection of letters in which he expressed his appreciation of the timely publications of the university and the argentine scientific community , particularly that of george gamow and alfred keacke , and their contributions to the promotion of international research .

= pietro maria gazzaniga =
pietro maria gazzaniga ( 3 march 1722 at bergamo , italy – 11 december 1799 at vicenza ) was an italian dominican theologian .


== life ==
at a very early age he entered the order of st. dominic , and studied the various branches of ecclesiastical sciences , especially philosophy and theology . he was then , despite his youth , appointed to teach philosophy and church history , first in the various houses of his order and later at the university of bologna .
the university of vienna had in 1760 a vacancy for the chair of dogmatic theology , which had been assigned exclusively to members of the dominican order . the empress maria theresa appealed to gazzaniga 's superiors to have him transferred . at his feet sat the empress herself , cardinal migazzi , and garampi ; and pope pius vi , during his sojourn in vienna , attended his lectures . after twenty years he returned to italy , where he continued to lecture in various places until his death .


== works ==
in theology gazzaniga was a leading defender and exponent of the thomistic school during the eighteenth century . by strict adherence to the traditional teaching of his school , he set himself against the spirit of his age , which sought to modernize and to conduct all theological schools of austria on plans designed to render them more independent of ecclesiastical and royal authority . he succeeded in winning over to his cause simon rock , till then an associate of gerard van swieten , the promoter of the jansenist spirit in austria , and with his assistance restored thomism in the schools . his fidelity to aquinas likewise rendered him very bitter against molinism ; so much so , in fact , that he succeeded in persuading gomarist calvinists , as against the arminians , to subscribe to the thomistic doctrine of predestination and reprobation ( ad sanam thomistarum de predestinations et reprobatione doctrinam descenderunt , proelect . , vol . ii , diss . 6 , n. 242 ) .
his principal work , the `` praelectiones theologicae habitae in vindobonensi universitate , nunc vero alio methodo dispositae , emendatae et auctae `` , went through many editions ( 9 vols . , bologna , 1788–1793 ; bassani , 1831 ) .

horace o . bell ( february 27 , 1926 – march 9 , 2002 ) was a cuban-american physicist . he died in washington , d.c. while working for the united states air force in miami , florida , during the cuban missile crisis.bell 's work investigated waves in radioactivity , studied radar , meteor showers , space weather , weather forecasting , black-box weather stations , ionosphere , communication satellites , jet aircraft , lightning , space debris , nuclear reactor water vapor absorption and photoelectric discharge , ultraviolet rays , and other topics in the sciences .


== early life and education ==
bell 's father , ernest , was a barber from caguas , mexico . he moved to fort lauderdale in 1946 and later to rio rancho , mexico , where he was a demonstrator of physics at fort lauderdale central high school and city college .
bell graduated from union college in brooklyn , new york in 1948 with a b.a . degree in physics . he then received his m.a . in physics from hunter college in 1948 . he then transferred to princeton university , where he earned a ph.d. in physics under hans bethe .


== career ==
after receiving his ph.d. , bell and a team of graduate students at princeton began experimenting with radar . in 1948 , bell and his co-workers discovered what they thought were anomalous interference patterns with increasing intensity . when they placed a heavy magnetic compass barbell in front of a computer designed to measure radio-activity at their laboratory , it reported anomalous effects.because the bahamas had just been hit by three separate jet explosions , bell figured that if the disruptions were cumulative , the probability of large explosions of either the ground or upper atmosphere was very high , and that once a larger event had occurred , the probability of the smaller one would be the same.bell went on to perform a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon and determined that the local weather was , in fact , shaping the weather , although the precise mechanism for this is not known . during the gulf of tonkin incident , which eventually led to the use of the now discredited helicopter spraying theory in south vietnam , he concluded that the main cause of the storm was probably high-velocity , high-altitude cumulus rainstorms.he worked for the office of scientific research and development during the 1950s and 1960s . from the late 1960s until his death , he helped to build up the manhattan project and is the author of `` s. t. mcconnell , `` radiation and deterrence `` , `` rays , `` `` radar , `` and `` space weather `` . he was a member of the american geophysical union 's executive committee for the bicentennial of the american geophysical union .
bell 's writings have been referenced in books and studies and he has been considered one of the most important figures in science in the last 20 years . after his death , `` astronomer v `` , published by the earth institute , reprinted several of bell 's research papers and was one of the preprints for his book `` the space weather of the world. ``


== awards and honors ==

american geophysical union , 1988
american mathematical society , 1991


== research ==
in 1956 , bell proposed the terminology `` propagation within the electromagnetic environment of certain intelligibles `` in a paper `` on the problem of frequency versus phase in radiative flux . `` he went on to work for the air force in the central intelligence agency during the korean war and traveled around the world researching space weather , meteor showers , solar activity , and space radiation.bell also wrote a number of books on science and have been cited by a wide variety of scientists , including physicists carl sagan , martin gardner , and david deming .

the second edition of the tale of harald hedin was published in norway in 1619 . the poem `` norske voyn to svenska østfold `` was published in a pamphlet written by her sister , the feminist nellmei dettsker . it was accompanied by a booklet ( entitled `` discorsi forma usu capitale latin `` ) , in which she described the procedure of surviving a plague . this pamphlet was subsequently published in the united states as the first volume of a large anthology by j. h. hudson and c. l. myers titled voynas ungdritt i hansen . this was eventually reprinted in two volumes , and continued to be popular after its founding in 1902 , reprinted by the american steamship company in 1943 . in the supplement to the first book , she appears to refer to `` the harp of my father , the smith of my mother 's , and the sweeper of the house , `` referring to herself and her family , whom she describes as `` good linenners `` . however , there is no record of her having spoken of their profession . they are presumably described in the tales of harald hedin , and the passage in the third book that gives her identity as a nun seems to have originated with hedin 's own narrative , which may have begun as a comment on the women 's right to accessie against persecution by the church .


== literary legacy ==

dorothea von heytinger has been listed as the author of more than 35 editions of the norwegian version of the tale of harald hedin . her uncle was henrik stanislaus von heytinger . a merlot from harald hedin 's collected travels has been called `` her jellied hazel , milk-beer , and chocolate `` .

robert fiske griggs ( 22 august 1881 in brooklyn , connecticut – 10 june 1962 ) , was a botanist who led a 1915 national geographic society expedition to observe the aftermath of the katmai volcanic eruption .
in june 1917 , griggs and the eager ngs explorers rushed to the katmai coast with the express goal of exploring the valley of ten thousand smokes . they quickly worked their way up through the ash-filled katmai river valley and over the pass . it was a month of terror and elation for the twelve adventurers . through the long alaska summer days , they took chemical and geologic samples , shot photographs , and made rough maps . mincing their way across the crumbling , treacherous surface of the hot ash , they studied the temperatures and temperaments of the roaring fumaroles and explored the perilous margins of the pyroclastic deposits . as they explored and documented the valley , they began to build a picture of the eruption . for five years , the american public had been entranced by the exciting volcanic discoveries in alaska . hungry for stories to push the horrors of world war i from their minds , thousands of national geographic subscribers were thrilled to read griggs ’ gripping articles about the adventures of his exploring parties .
as the discoveries unfolded , griggs became increasingly zealous in his advocacy of the site . his vivid descriptions of the wonders of the katmai country ignited the interest of what was then a budding conservation movement in the united states . the mysterious volcanic valley seemed an ideal candidate for protection . griggs and the chiefs of the national geographic society campaigned persistently to preserve the area , and in 1918 , president woodrow wilson declared 1,700 square miles ( 4,400 km2 ) of land as katmai national monument .
he holds degrees from ohio state university ( ba ) , university of minnesota ( ma ) , and harvard university ( ph.d ) and taught at fargo college , ohio state , george washington university , and university of pittsburgh .

== research ==
in his research , wrangham looked at the effects of ultraviolet ( u ) radiation on the kidneys . he then compared the rate of urination with that of air at different depths . the results showed that this radiation affected the entire urinary system more than other types of radiation . wrangham further demonstrated that urination was inhibited at a rate much greater than the rate at which a chemical reaction took place.wrangham 's experiments also showed that urination was the most sensitive part of the urinary tract , and that only the kidneys responded to this radiation , which meant that urination would not slow down as the brain became accustomed to the high level of urination.wrangham was recognized for his work at the rockefeller institute . he later became professor at the university of california , san diego . he was also dean of the biological sciences department at the university of wisconsin-madison . he was considered one of the greatest biologists of his time , and his laboratory is the subject of the biographical obituary `` alexander wrangham : biographer `` of the journal of medical photosynthesis.it was wrangham 's essay `` the amity for freedom `` , published in the new england journal of medicine , which laid the foundation for later controversies over the limits of animal rights . the essay encouraged a belief in freedom of speech and personal autonomy . this led some to believe that wrangham was a feminist , and the proponents of this interpretation disagreed with this , and that the results of the test he used were flawed . wrangham himself said of this work , `` it seemed to me that man , like every animal , is influenced by this instinctive instinct to seek the cheapest share of a total producer of animal products `` .a documentary film about wrangham , recently released , was produced by the wrangham institute for health and happiness , produced in collaboration with univision . it was directed by seth schoenfeld , who served as medical editor for dr. wrangham 's research .

adhémar jean claude barré de saint-venant ( 23 august 1797 , villiers-en-bière , seine-et-marne – 6 january 1886 , saint-ouen , loir-et-cher ) was a mechanician and mathematician who contributed to early stress analysis and also developed the unsteady open channel flow shallow water equations , also known as the saint-venant equations that are a fundamental set of equations used in modern hydraulic engineering . the one-dimensional saint-venant equation is a commonly used simplification of the shallow water equations . although his full surname was barré de saint-venant in mathematical literature other than french he is known as saint-venant . his name is also associated with saint-venant 's principle of statically equivalent systems of load , saint-venant 's theorem and for saint-venant 's compatibility condition , the integrability conditions for a symmetric tensor field to be a strain .
in 1843 he published the correct derivation of the navier–stokes equations for a viscous flow and was the first to `` properly identify the coefficient of viscosity and its role as a multiplying factor for the velocity gradients in the flow `` . even though he published before stokes , the equations do not bear his name .
barré de saint-venant developed a version of vector calculus similar to that of grassmann ( now understood as exterior differential forms ) which he published in 1845 . a dispute arose between saint-venant and grassmann over priority for this invention . grassmann had published his results in 1844 , but barré de saint-venant claimed he had developed the method in 1832 .
barré de saint-venant was born at the château de fortoiseau , villiers-en-bière , seine-et-marne , france .
his father was jean barré de saint-venant , ( 1737–1810 ) , a colonial officer of the isle of saint-domingue ( later haiti ) . his mother was marie-thérèse josèphe laborie ( born saint-domingue , 1769 ) . he entered the école polytechnique , in 1813 at sixteen years old . where he studied under gay-lussac . graduating in 1816 he worked for the next 27 years as an engineer , initially his passion for chemistry led him a post as a élève-commissaire ( student commissioner ) for the service des poudres et salpêtres ( powders and saltpeter service ) and then as a civil engineer at the corps des ponts et chaussées . he married in 1837 , rohaut fleury from paris . following a disagreement on an issue of road with the municipal administration of paris , he was suddenly retired as `` chief engineer , second class `` , on 1 april 1848 . in 1850 saint-venant won a contest to be appointed the chair of agricultural engineering at the agronomic institute of versailles , a post he occupied two years.he went on to teach mathematics at the école des ponts et chaussées ( national school of bridges and roads ) where he succeeded coriolis .
in 1868 , at 71 years old , he was elected to succeed poncelet in the mechanics section of the académie des sciences , and continued research work for a further 18 years . he died in january 1886 at saint-ouen , loir-et-cher . sources differ on his date of death : gives 6 january whereas 22 january . in 1869 he was given the title 'count ' ( comte ) by pope pius ix .

oskar m c3 a8ld c3 b6gel de groot ( 12 may 1888 – 9 may 1945 ) was a dutch mathematician who contributed to differential equations , topology and algebraic topology .


== life ==
de groot was born in linseenam , baden .
he was a member of `` die angewandte handelslehre `` ( the royal institute of technology , and from 1931 held the chair in algebraics ) . he became a member of `` theoretische lehre von den sud `` ( `` theoretical teaching school of the royal institute of technology `` ) in 1908 , and continued to hold that position until his death . he had four sons and one daughter .
in 1912 he published `` symmetry und numerical analysis `` , which paved the way for later authors , including cornelis van hyck and max merkle . he was a strong supporter of algebraic topology , both in his honor and of boager . he was one of the founders of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in 1931 , and its secretary until his death .
he received a ph.d. in 1936 , and his position at the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences at the time of his death was in mathematics .


== works ==
de groot 's major work was the book he is best known for , `` symmetry and numerical analysis . ( co-written with gert-jan huszel ) . `` in it , de groot developed the principle of homotopy groups . according to the principle , if two homotopy groups are now labeled with the same number of elements , then they have a common exterior . subtracting the number of elements in the group from the number of elements in the outer one produces the number of elements of the inner group ( or the number of primitives ) . this number ( which is now called the homotopy group dimension ) is known as the homotopy product dimension and is written hgg ( roughly `` homotopy group product `` ) .
he was also a pioneer in the field of integral geometry , which , according to quantum mechanics , also shows the existence of flat surfaces , for which they would be called n-adic .

= richard crawshay =
richard crawshay ( 1739 – 27 june 1810 ) was a london iron merchant and then south wales ironmaster .
richard crawshay was born in normanton in the west riding of yorkshire . initially starting work aged 16 , working for mr bicklewith of york yard , thames street , london ( to whom he was apprenticed ) in a bar iron warehouse in london , he became sole proprietor of the business on bicklewith 's retirement in 1763 .
he married mary bourne in 1763 and they had a son william and three daughters , anne , elizabeth and charlotte . charlotte married benjamin hall , and became the mother of benjamin hall , 1st baron llanover .
by the 1770s he was a leading london iron merchant , dealing mainly in swedish and russian iron . the firm was crawshay and moser in 1774 , but crawshay , cornwell and moser in 1784 . the business still existed as r & w crawshay in 1816 . by 1775 , he was acting as anthony bacon 's agent for supplying iron cannon to the board of ordnance and was from 1777 a partner in that business ( casting cannon at cyfarthfa ironworks at merthyr tydfil ) . this continued until bacon had to give up government contracts in 1782 , because he was a member of parliament .
in 1786 , following the death of anthony bacon , he took over the whole cyfarthfa ironworks , in partnership with william stevens ( a london merchant ) and james cockshutt , who had previously managed the forge and boring mill for david tanner . in may 1787 he took out a licence from henry cort for his puddling process , but the rolling mill needed was not completed until 1789 . he solved the problems of the puddling process by using an iron plate for the furnace ceiling and sea-washed sand for the floor . in 1791 he terminated the partnership , which had made little profit . he continued the business alone , and had two blast furnaces , 8 puddling furnaces , 3 melting fineries , 3 balling furnaces , and a rolling mill in 1794 . a blast furnace was built by 1796 , and a fourth in 1796 . there were 6 by 1810 . he thus developed cyfarthfa into one of the most important ironworks in south wales .
crawshay was very ambitious and imperious in manner , being called 'the tyrant ' by some , but was without social pretension . he was active in protecting the interests of the iron trade and was a major promoter of the glamorganshire canal which immensely improved transport of iron to cardiff docks . at his death in 1810 his estate was worth £1.5 million . in his will he left three-eighths of his ironworks to his son william crawshay i , three-eighths to his son-in-law , and two-eighths to his nephew joseph bailey .

uspensky 's doctoral thesis ( 1879 ) dealt with the foundation of the second bulgarian empire . although he specialized in the byzantine-bulgarian relations and investigated the slavic influence on the byzantine economy , uspensky also researched and wrote extensively on the crusades .
in 1894 uspensky , who shared slavophile ideals , decided to move to constantinople to study and protect the surviving monuments of byzantine antiquity , which had been neglected by the ottoman authorities for centuries . he founded the russian archaeological institute ( headquartered at studion ) and presided over its pioneering archaeological research in constantinople , asia minor , macedonia and bulgaria . in 1900 , he was elected into the russian academy of sciences . with the outbreak of world war i , uspensky was forced to abandon his work and flee turkey ..
back in petrograd , the 70-year-old professor was invited to edit the organ of byzantine studies , vizantiyskiy vremennik . after the october revolution , he delivered lectures at the leningrad university ( 1922–27 ) and , enduring criticism of the bolshevik authorities , prepared for publication the results of a lifelong study , a monumental three-volume account of the history of the byzantine empire .
uspensky died in leningrad in 1928 . the posthumous publication of his magnum opus , based on numerous unpublished sources and unprecedented in scope , demonstrated the wide range of his scholarship . his book about the trapezuntine empire also appeared posthumously . the taktikon uspensky is named after him .

johann gottlob carpzov ( 26 september 1679 , dresden – 7 april 1767 , lübeck ) was a german christian old testament scholar , a nephew of johann benedict carpzov ii and a son of samuel benedict carpzov . he was the most famous and most important biblical scholar of the carpzov family . he was titular professor of oriental languages at leipzig from 1719 to 1730 , and preacher and theologian until his death . like his uncle , he was an opponent of the pietists . his critical works are : introductio in libros vet . test . 1721 , 4th ed . 1757 ; critica sacra ( i . original text , ii . versions , iii . reply to whiston ) , 1728 ; apparatus historico-criticus antiquitatum et codicis sacri et gentis hebrææ , 1748 . the apparatus is in the form of annotations to thomas goodwin 's moses and aaron , and appended to it are dissertations on `` the synagogue treated with honor `` ( a statement of what the christian church has retained of ancient jewish customs ) , on `` the charity system of the ancient jews `` ( discussion of the question whether צדקה in the old testament ever means `` alms `` ) , and others .
according to the jewish encyclopedia ,

carpzov represents both an advance and a retrogression in biblical science — an advance in fullness of material and clearness of arrangement ( his introductio is the first work that deserves the name ) , and a retrogression in critical analysis , for he held fast to the literal inspiration of the hebrew text of the old testament and bitterly opposed the freer positions of simon , spinoza , and clericus . his antiquarian writings are still interesting and useful .

zatz was born in erlangen . he was educated at the university of erlangen and the technische hochschule ( technology institute ) of the university of freiburg , where he later earned his doctorate in 1945 . after graduation he worked for the ministry of economic affairs ( ministry of war production ) and again at the ministry of finance . after the second world war he was involved in anti-communist activities in his home city of berlin and in the great depression .
zatz 's ideas made him particularly unpopular among political conservatives , particularly those opposed to ludwig von mises'position that science should be carried on with empirical methods and objective decision making . social scientists were against the mainstream `` theory `` of the german state , since the german ideal of man was the individual . zatz 's work sparked the radicalization of germany 's political scientists . his theory of experimental sociology was the first to argue for the application of multiple focus to problems of organization . his research focused on industrial research , industrial social capital , and the american institute of industrial research , whose members included the economist reinhold niebuhr . zatz drew the leading marxist economists ’ attention to the importance of the relations between capitalist and proletariat in the economy .
he developed widely used statistics for agricultural production and the working class of germany . he then developed theoretical models of social conflict and decided how they would be justified . these theories , backed by empirical data from nazi germany and the 1960s experiments of the u.s. , had significant impact on the ideas of political science and the study of social science .
zatz died in berlin in 1983 .

adolfas jucys with his disciples developed the mathematical apparatus of many-electron atoms with open shells . the most known work in this field is the monograph , in which the original graphical method for the quantities of the angular momentum theory was presented . in particular , yutsis graphs ( connected simple graphs which can be partitioned into two vertex-induced trees ) are named after adolfas jucys .

youssef wahba was born in cairo , egypt in 1852 of a prominent coptic family . his father , wahba bey had been a founder of the first coptic charitable society that included muslim scholars such as abdallah nadim and sheikh muhammed abduh . he translated the code napoleon into arabic while at the ministry of justice between 1875 and 1882 and participated in setting the modern judicial system in egypt becoming one of the first egyptian judges in the mixed court of appeals in 1894.he later became minister of foreign affairs in 1912 then minister of finance from 15 april 1914 until 21 may 1920 . as minister of finance , he introduced the first bank notes in egypt backed by the full faith and credit of the egyptian sultanate which bore his signature as minister of finance . he became prime minister of egypt in 1919 during a difficult period in egypt 's political life . many members of the coptic christian community to which he belonged , objected to his accepting the premiership on the grounds that it would antagonize the relationship between muslims and christians when both were united under the wafd party to fight against the british occupation . youssef always maintained the view that it was critical that a government nominated by the sultan of egypt lead the country rather than have the british fully annex it ( especially as the victorious powers were carving up the old ottoman empire at the versailles conference ) . during his premiership , youssef wahba introduced several economic reforms including the removal of price controls on agricultural products , probably a first in the history of egypt , as well as the creation of the banque misr by talaat harb pasha , the first national bank .

he died in 1934 and was married to doudou , daughter of mikhail bey el nakkadi and had eight children . two of his sons mourad wahba pasha ( 1879-1972 ) and sadek wahba pasha ( 1885-1971 ) had prominent careers in the egyptian judicial system and the diplomatic service respectively . youssef wahba 's grandson , sadek wahba , is a notable new york city-based managing partner of a private equity firm i squared capital and member of the board of trustees of the american university in cairo .

jules louis gabriel violle ( 16 november 1841 , langres , haute-marne – 12 september 1923 , fixin , bourgogne-franche-comté ) was a french physicist and inventor .
he is notable for having determined the solar constant at mont blanc in 1875 , and , in 1881 , for proposing a standard for luminous intensity , called the violle , equal to the light emitted by 1 cm² of platinum at its melting point . ( it was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp , but it was made obsolete by the candela , the standard si unit . )
throughout his life , violle taught at several colleges including the university of lyon and the conservatoire des arts et métiers in paris . he was one of the founders of the institut d'optique théorique et appliquée and the école supérieure d'optique . he improved and invented a number of devices for measuring radiation , and determined the freezing and melting points of palladium .
violle is believed by some to be the secret identity of fulcanelli , a contemporary french alchemist whose true identity is still debated . his biography can be found in this book : `` a l'ombre des chênes , l'alchimiste de la république `` . [ 1 ]

dubois was the son of john dubois ( 1622-1684 ) and anne , daughter of charles herle . the wealthy huguenot family was in the cloth and silk trade and charles inherited his father 's home at mitcham , surrey , where he had a garden filled with the newest exotics at that time in course of introduction . john dubois was involved in the politics of london and represented the whigs . in 1681 he was in the committee of the east india company . a son who was also known as john dubois became cashier general to the east india company on 30 september 1697 . dubois became cashier-general to the east india company on 27 october 1702 after the death of his step-brother , john dubois the younger . in 1730 charles dubois and his nephew waldo dubois were implicated in a financial scandal involving some cargo shipments and false accounts . in 1734 he and a clerk named tullidge were implicated in monetary losses arising from accepting security notes instead of cash from traders . as regards botany , he seems to have been chiefly a patron rather than a worker ; thus he appears as one of twelve english subscribers to micheli 's ‘ nova genera , ’ 1728 . his name , however , occurs as having contributed observations to the third edition of ray 's ‘ synopsis , ’ 1724 . many of the plants in his collection was acquired by his step-brother daniel du bois while others came from correspondents such as edward bulkley in madras . his dried plants occupy seventy-four folio volumes , the entire number of specimens being about thirteen thousand , and are in excellent preservation ; they form part of the herbarium at the oxford botanic garden . dubois also collected shells , fossils and coins . he made notes on insects as well . dubois obtained rice seed from india which was introduced into british south carolina in 1766 through a thomas marsh.he died 21 october 1740 . it has been claimed brown established his genus duboisia in honour of charles dubois but it was actually named in honour of a louis dubois .

== life and career ==
scammon was born in minneapolis , minnesota , and earned a bachelor 's degree in political science from the university of minnesota in 1935 . he later earned a master 's degree from the university of michigan , also in political science.scammon enlisted in the army during world war ii , attaining the rank of captain . he served in occupied germany after the war , rising to head the military government 's office of elections and political parties . after his discharge , he served as chief of the research division in western europe for the u.s. department of state from 1948 to 1955.after leaving government service , scammon founded the elections research center in 1955 . its enduring contribution was the long-running series of volumes , america votes , which for the first time provided standard and reliable statistics for the results of major elections in all 50 states . ( the biennial compilations , published by congressional quarterly 's imprint , cq books , were later co-produced with scammon associate alice mcgillivray . after scammon closed the center in 1995 , rhodes cook has continued to oversee production of america votes . scammon also served as a consultant to nbc news in the 1960 general election , working with the rca computers and methods to call state-by-state totals for the presidential race . he was briefly introduced to the audience on the air on election night .
in 1961 , president john f. kennedy appointed scammon as census director , which he continued until 1965 , during the administration of lyndon b. johnson . indeed , on november 13 , 1963 , scammon was at the table for the 1st planning meeting of jfk 's 1964 campaign to re-elect the president ; a campaign which never occurred . according to the washington post , while serving as director of the census , scammon was `` a personal adviser to presidents kennedy and johnson on public opinion and political trends . `` returning to his voting research , scammon was hired by nbc news to direct its extensive election-night coverage in november 1968 . he continued his work as a consultant for nbc until 1988 . in 1976 he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association.as an author , scammon 's most famous work was the real majority : an extraordinary examination of the american electorate ( 1970 ) , co-authored with ben j. wattenberg . the new york times described it as `` arguing that , for the democratic party to survive , it needed to look beyond the economic issues that dominated the american electoral scene in the first half of the 20th century , [ and ] toward social issues that deeply disturbed voters in middle america . `` in scammon 's words , the typical voter was `` unyoung , unpoor and unblack . `` his blunt phrasing `` shocked many democrats , but resonated true with others . `` in some ways , the real majority served as an answer to kevin phillips 's 1969 volume , the emerging republican majority . and it presaged a shift away from the politics of the new deal , and towards a more ideological politics , especially at the presidential level , that largely benefited republicans in 1972 , 1980 , 1984 and 1988.scammon was married to mary allen scammon and lived in chevy chase , maryland for five decades . he died of alzheimer 's disease at a rest home in gaithersburg .

charles émile blanchard ( 6 march 1819 – 11 february 1900 ) was a french zoologist and entomologist .


== career ==
blanchard was born in paris . his father was an artist and naturalist and émile began natural history very early in life . when he was 14 years old , jean victoire audouin ( 1797—1841 ) , allowed him access to the laboratory of the muséum national d'histoire naturelle . in 1838 , he became a technician or préparateur in this then , as now , famous institution . in 1841 , he became assistant-naturalist .
he accompanied henri milne-edwards ( 1800—1885 ) and jean louis armand de quatrefages de breau ( 1810—1892 ) to sicily on a marine zoology expedition . he published , in 1845 a histoire des insectes , or history of the insects and , in 1854—1856 zoologie agricole or agricultural zoology . this last work is remarkable : it presents in a precise way the harmful or pest species and the damage they cause to various crop plants . this work was illustrated by his father . blanchard was critical of darwinism . he argued that charles darwin 's pigeon studies were unscientific and that his ideas about evolution were false and unoriginal.in 1870 , blanchard and charles-philippe robin opposed the election of darwin as a corresponding member of the french academy of sciences.he published an atlas of the anatomy of the vertebrates which appeared between 1852 and 1864 . this publication raised his hopes to obtain the chair of reptiles and fish at the natural history museum left vacant by the death of auguste duméril ( 1812—1870 ) but it was finally léon vaillant ( 1834—1914 ) who was selected . however , in 1862 , he was given the chair of natural history of crustacea , arachnida and insects . he left this in 1894 following his infirmity . he was elected , in 1862 into the academy of science . he began to lose his sight after 1860 and became blind in 1890 . he died in paris .

== life and career ==
wolfowitz was born in 1910 in warsaw , poland , the son of helen ( pearlman ) and samuel wolfowitz . he emigrated with his parents to the united states in 1920 . in the mid-1930s , wolfowitz began his career as high school mathematics teacher and continued teaching until 1942 when he received his ph.d. degree in mathematics from new york university . while a part-time graduate student , wolfowitz met abraham wald , with whom he collaborated in numerous joint papers in the field of mathematical statistics . this collaboration continued until wald 's death in an airplane crash in 1950 . in 1951 , wolfowitz became a professor of mathematics at cornell university , where he stayed until 1970 . from 1970 to 1978 he was at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign . he died of a heart attack in tampa , florida , where he had become a professor at the university of south florida after retiring from illinois .
wolfowitz 's main contributions were in the fields of statistical decision theory , non-parametric statistics , sequential analysis , and information theory .
one of his results is the strong converse to claude shannon 's coding theorem . while shannon could prove only that the block error probability can not become arbitrarily small if the transmission rate is above the channel capacity , wolfowitz proved that the block error rate actually converges to one . as a consequence , shannon 's original result is today termed `` the weak theorem `` ( sometimes also shannon 's `` conjecture `` by some authors ) .

== research ==
edwards published more than one hundred journal articles and books including decision analysis and behavioral research and utility theories : measurement and applications . in the introduction to a festschrift for edwards , barbara mellers states [ 1 ]

decision science and technology is a compilation of chapters written in honor of a remarkable man , ward edwards . among ward 's many contributions are two significant accomplishments , either of which would have been enough for a very distinguished career . first , ward is the founder of behavioral decision theory . this interdisciplinary discipline addresses the question of how people actually confront decisions , as opposed to the question of how they should make decisions . second , ward laid the groundwork for sound normative systems by noticing which tasks humans can do well and which tasks computers should perform.in 1962 , edwards founded the bayesian research conference with the aim to incorporate and apply bayesian statistical methods and ideas to decision theory . in statistics he is well-known as lead author of edwards , lindman , and savage ( 1963 ) , bayesian statistical inference for psychological research , psychological review , 70 ( 3 ) , 193-242 . this article introduced the notion of 'stable estimation ' , and was the first to note that a p-value of 0.05 in the normal model corresponded to a lower bound on the bayes factor of 0.26 .

jacques philippe marie binet ( french : [ binɛ ] ; 2 february 1786 – 12 may 1856 ) was a french mathematician , physicist and astronomer born in rennes ; he died in paris , france , in 1856 . he made significant contributions to number theory , and the mathematical foundations of matrix algebra which would later lead to important contributions by cayley and others . in his memoir on the theory of the conjugate axis and of the moment of inertia of bodies he enumerated the principle now known as binet 's theorem . he is also recognized as the first to describe the rule for multiplying matrices in 1812 , and binet 's formula expressing fibonacci numbers in closed form is named in his honour , although the same result was known to abraham de moivre a century earlier .


== career ==
binet graduated from l'école polytechnique in 1806 , and returned as a teacher in 1807 . he advanced in position until 1816 when he became an inspector of studies at l'école . he held this post until 13 november 1830 , when he was dismissed by the recently crowned king louis-philippe of france , probably because of binet 's strong support of the previous king , charles x . in 1823 binet succeeded delambre in the chair of astronomy at the collège de france . he was made a chevalier in the légion d'honneur in 1821 , and was elected to the académie des sciences in 1843 .

robert v. simeon ( december 4 , 1858 , new york city - january 28 , 1947 ) was a psychologist . simeon was noted for his research on association learning in animals and in humans . he studied the effect of early and intense exposure to an unfamiliar and threatening sound . his findings were published in two papers published in the proceedings of the royal society of london ( the most comprehensive english journal on psychology ) .
simeon also studied color vision , as revealed by polarized light . he developed a chromatic scale of color vision based on segmented images of pure hue . the scale provides a visual representation of the range of colors in the human visual system and also serves as an effective index of stimulus values , ranging from normal color vision to a first-order hyperpolarization .
his studies in color vision and associative learning were also important for scientists who studied art , and particularly painting , and both theorie der klasse und handelungen ( theorie of color and handwriting , 1887 ) and gedichte der art ( illustrated art and handcraft ) were translations of russian publications and a critique of contemporary art , especially european art in general.simeon 's work was awarded the rudolf flahns prize in 1896 for work `` illustrative of the origin of painting , and of its relation to that of another branch of art : sculpture `` .

== biography ==
borne in heide , he was attracted early to plant sciences early and as a young man attracted the attention of director ernst ferdinand nolte while a volunteer at the botanischer garten der christian-albrechts-universität zu kiel . after an interlude caused by the second schleswig war , and during which he worked in the postal services . this job , which he abhorred , forced to move a number of times until he could settle in 1867 in hohenwestedt , where he remained until 1874 . there he began lecturing at the agricultural school ( german : landwirtschaftsschule ) . he also began issuing exsiccatae and seed collections until nolte 's successor , august w. eichler , appointed him as an assistant . when eichler went to work at the university of berlin herbarium , he soon invited the younger man to join him . a complete autodidact , hennings rose to become one of the foremost mycologists of his time , and particularly a specialist of tropical fungi thanks to the innumerable collections sent to berlin from the german colonies and south america . he had two sons from his wife mathilde , which he had married in 1876 , but lost one to illness in 1907 , which , in the words of his obituarist , `` paralyzed his energies and stole the pen from [ his ] busy hand `` . he died within a year .

== early life ==
daniel becker was born on january 6 , 1881 , in vienna . his family immigrated to vienna in 1885 , then followed it to germany .
becker studied philosophy and german at the university of würzburg , and wrote on political economy . becker finished his studies in leipzig in 1907 .


== career ==

in 1928 becker published a book in german entitled rhetoric of capitalistic production : die statistik der erscheinungen der gegenwartlichen preussischen und insel ( the economy of a state , the state as an instrument of capitalist production ) . becker concluded that the german state , through its policies and economic institutions , is essentially a measure of the meritocracy of capitalism and racial supremacism.from 1928 to 1931 , becker chaired the technical commission for the economic affairs of poland . from 1933 to 1939 , becker served as director of the economics ministry 's european development department .
becker died in stuttgart on october 11 , 1965 .


== work ==
becker was one of the first german scholars to develop a comparative perspective on economics . he emphasized the comparative values of the western democracies , their methods of social and economic development , and their historical development . he developed the notion of the equalizer concept in economics as an analytical way to distinguish between higher economic development within a country and slower economic development in a country without such a development .
becker 's account of the effects of political , social , economic , and geographic factors on economic growth deals with many different people and institutions , ranging from individual and family life and political life to the development of bureaucracies and diplomacy . becker writes that while others `` tended to diminish the significance of differences and insignificance `` of individual differences as to economic development , the main factors are those with `` major social and political consequences `` .
becker wrote that as history unfolds , the ability to develop some countries , the ability to develop others , and the ability to recover the rest will depend on the development of democratic capitalism . becker thought that inter-national competition among nations should lead to `` progressive social development `` , but that further development is always and necessarily directed toward strengthening democratic capitalism and diminishing the privileges of the privileged .


== students ==
becker was well known as a teacher , both in germany and in switzerland . a student named hans gross commented that becker was the first person to use the term reformist and productive . hans gross was a particularly important influence on becker , as gross had developed economic theories based on various aspects of the post-industrial development .

tupper was born on 4 august 1814 at aylesbury . he was educated at maidstone grammar school , then attended westminster school . in the evenings he attended rugby matches , and also frequented the countryside . tupper 's father was an irish republican who was active in the red cross . tupper became an active political activist in the league of nations in 1872 , when he worked on the committee on claims to the west indies .
tupper is most notable for his `` standing stone of scientific and cultural values `` and for the tupper prize , given for `` excellence in the past , present and future. `` his political activity was cut short when he was elected member of parliament for varick , county dublin , in 1872 . the party lost the seat , but he was re-elected to the irish parliament in 1879 .


== political career ==
tupper made his political capital through his connection with the league of nations , with whom he had worked previously in the drafting of its rules . the league had formally dissolved after the civil war in ireland in 1867 . tupper ran unsuccessfully in the elections of 1868 and 1870 for the seat of varick in east tyrone , on the isle of mull . he retained this seat from 1870 until 1876 when he retired , but was re-elected in the election of 1876 .
he returned to his village of aylesbury in 1878 , where he built a large house on his property , designed by architect william bessemer . tupper , who was greatly interested in the natural history of the district , invited the prominent irish photographer and naturalist john victor clarke to begin work on a survey of the area . the resulting report , ' a natural history of an irish rural area ' , was published in 1879 . the resulting discoveries resulted in an irish antiquarian-naturalist 's house , erected in 1882 .

when david lloyd george , who was negotiating a peace treaty between britain and ireland , secured support for breaking off the process in may 1885 , it was in part tupper who spoke out against the recent peace . in a series of letters , tupper revealed the extent to which the `` split `` between the british and irish public was being worked out . he wrote :

for the past half-century the english public have never acknowledged the essential significance of the alliance with the irish . the facts , indeed the whole pattern of british action since the war of independence have been obscure , the minds of many observers have been split , and , because of the approach of the government , when it began in the new year the result was something like a world-wide shock .
in later life tupper worked in kildare on behalf of irish interests in the irish community . he was also a member of the board of trade of ireland , the irish committee of war , the irish labour party , the post office and many others.tupper died at his home in a cemetery on 22 april 1885 . his health had improved , and his papers are now lost . the grave lies near to a collection of tuberculosis notes .

= dimitri navachine =
dimitri navachine ( дмитрий сергеевич навашин , 30 august 1889 – 25 january 1937 ) was a russian politician and economist . he governed the bcen-eurobank in france from 1927 to 1929 . in addition , he served as a consultant to the french popular front to offer advice on combating the economic crisis in france . ideologically , navachine was a socialist but his politics and theories were more closely associated with the popular front , not marxism–leninism . although well-respected for his economic views in france , navachine nonetheless created many enemies both there and in the soviet union . he was assassinated in 1937 but his case still remains unsolved .


== biography ==
dimitri navachine was born in moscow on 30 august 1889 . after the february revolution in 1917 , he was assigned to the vice presidency of the red cross under alexander kerensky 's newly formed russian provisional government to oversee the treatment of german prisoners during world war i . perhaps due to his experience with economics and his invaluable connections in the west , navachine managed to stay in good favor with the communist party when it seized power late in 1917 , despite being a kerensky supporter . at first critical of the new government , navachine nonetheless assisted with restoring the country 's economy , devastated by war and revolution . the soviets ' first important assignment for navachine was to send him to spain in 1921 ; as a diplomat , navachine negotiated with spain to exchange its petroleum reserves with the soviet union rather than royal dutch shell.in 1927 , navachine was assigned to paris to assume the directorship of bcen eurobank which was responsible for the soviet union 's financial matters in france . he resigned from the position in 1929 and either worked for or with a group of right-wing bankers connected to the banque worms . after joseph stalin 's rise to power , navachine elected to remain in france , advising the french popular front , a political party that shared his ideological views , during france 's economic crisis in the 1930s . léon blum 's economic minister charles spinasse collaborated closely with navachine who also published a two-volume study on the issue . well-respected for his input , navachine counseled spinasse to disband the industrial cartels in france .

some historians insist , despite claims by navachine that he cut ties with the soviet union in 1929 , he engaged in espionage on behalf of the soviet government . french detectives , however , could find no evidence of him engaging in acts of espionage beyond the early 1930s . by 1937 , having already declined a summons to return to moscow , navachine was faced with open hostility from soviet agents . worse still , he created enemies with anti-semitic groups who were aware of his counsel in final political parties.on the morning of 25 january 1937 , while walking his fox terrier dog in bois de boulogne , navachine was assassinated , stabbed to death in an incident still unsolved by french police ; he was 47 years of age . his assassination has been connected to at least three other murders carried out during a state of ongoing violence in france : italian anti-fascist dissidents carlo and nello rosselli , and undercover agent laetitia nourrissat toureaux . panteleimon takhchiyanov , an officer of the nkvd , is suspected to have carried out navachine 's assassination , possibly to silence him before he released evidence proving the innocence of soviet political prisoners . another theory argues his attack was coordinated by the fascist extremist group la cagoule to create fears of communist conspirators in france.his remains are interred at montrouge cemetery .

in 1942 , tabachenko was dismissed from the university and expelled from the soviet union.in march 1943 , the soviet government denied him his permanent position at the university . but , in a letter to trotsky , the soviet premier nikita khrushchev appealed for a civilian position for tabachenko and gave priority to all other candidates . after a period of over three years , tabachenko was finally offered a professorship at the kharkiv academic center of musicology in march 1946 . as an academician , he taught at the theoretical institute , and also at the kharkiv state university .
his former pupil karel bogdanov recalled to the moscow times his first meeting with tabachenko at kharkiv . `` he was clearly in charge of the school of music , the concert hall , and orchestra . he had complete authority over everything in the building , and the administrators were afraid to screw him. `` he also recounted the experience of ernest bechdel , who met tabachenko while he was studying at the institute . `` i was in a familiar atmosphere , and we were able to watch television together , and that one would bring something out .... i think he introduced me to modern music , and i became a fan of its knowledge. `` in 1956 , he was honored by virtue of the designation `` the professor of the administration of the kharkiv university `` . in 1953 , he was made a corresponding member of the academy of arts and sciences of the soviet union.the kharkiv state university named in his honor the mikhailovsky-tabachenko building , which serves as the headquarters of the faculty of musicology .


== postwar years ==
tabachenko wrote several books and many articles on the history of russian poetry , later collecting them into volume 19 of his dialogues with the poets , published in 1957 . he died on 1 june 1989 . his son vladimir issikovich tabachenko became a prominent pedagogue in slavic languages .

= isaac scholz =
isaac scholz ( german : [ ssəɐŋks ] ; 1781 – 4 june 1822 ) was a german neuroanatomist and physiologist . scholz discovered in 1781 that the placement of the brain on the cornea creates a sort of surface 's membrane that surrounds the brain and allows colour information from different parts of the brain to be projected onto a separate 'vasculature ' ( der veschleit ) . he also discovered that the number of filaments that carry visual information from the eye to the retina can be increased by decreasing the number of connected sensory fibres .
scholz'discovery was praised by carl ludwig van dusen , the founder of modern vertebrate physiology , who wrote :

dr. scholz 's single discovery , in the sense in which it is now recognized , was with force and beauty as extraordinary as that of blaise pascal : for it seemed to awaken a desire in all thinkers , and to elevate the sublime against mere poetry . its importance is not in quantity , but in its value .
scholz'discoveries subsequently spread through europe , and are now known as `` scholz 's law `` , although he actually proposed it as a method for testing the physiology of animals . his work is still used today , for example in phycology.scholz 's reputation as a neuroanatomist did not last , however . in 1820 , shortly before his death from tuberculosis , scholz 's son , johann georg scholz , married a woman , the first cousin of his nephew , benjamin scholz . historians believe that the war-time laws and superstitions that scholz brought back from his exile in china , introduced by his son , reinforced the father 's image as the ideal ancestor of modern neurology.another nephew , gottlieb von schmidt ( 1796-1850 ) , became a neuroanatomist . he proposed that a distinction was made between parts of the human brain as innate and acquired as a byproduct of physiological development , rather than created in an evolutionary process . schmidt 's experimental method of removing damaged parts of the brain led to a great growth in both understanding of brain function and in this area of neurobiology . the possibility that different parts of the brain are related to one another or the environment was one of the central ideas of his philosophy . he took his ideas further by showing that the subdivisions of the human brain were products of accidental circumstance in combination with structural causes .

= alvaro alonso barba =
alvaro alonso barba was a secular catholic priest and metallurgist .
antonio ( 1786 ) says , `` baeticus ex oppido lepe , apud potosi `` ; hence barba is assumed to be of andalusian origin , from the ancient roman province of baetica . from the words lepe and potosi , lipes in western bolivia might be indicated .
he lived at potosi during the period when its silver mines were most productive and luxury among the spanish residents and mine owners had nearly reached its height . father barba divided his time between his priestly duties and a close study of the ores of this region and their treatment . there had been , since 1570 , a complete revolution in the treatment of silver ores , through the application of mercury , and a number of improvements followed , of which barba had knowledge .
in 1609 , he invented the pan amalgamation process ( in spanish the cazo or fondo process ) for extracting silver from ore by mixing it with salt and mercury and heating it in shallow copper vessels . in 1640 he published in madrid a book entitled arte de los metales , the earliest work on south american ores and minerals . it includes information on mineral localities in bolivia . the book has been republished in spanish , french , english and german .

jerzy zachary fick ( 27 march 1875 – 8 may 1967 ) was a polish-born american industrialist , lawyer , and political activist , the nephew of polish-american mathematician joseph szilard . fick is regarded as a pioneer of mathematical economics in the united states .


== life ==
fick was born to polish parents in naskowiec , belarus , the son of a judge of the local council , named jerzy zachary , and his wife , gertrude . his father was an attorney . after finishing high school , fick went to petersburg to study law . he then attended lemberg university where he was elected to a physics physics faculty and pursued a long career in physics research . in 1912 he was made director of a university near kraków , where he remained for the rest of his life . he then went to paris for further study and returned to poland to practice law .
he had to wait a year in paris before returning to kraków . from 1908 to 1915 he worked in the bar in the city of korczak , working for a bank and negotiating labor contracts for jewish peasants and workers . he later worked as a private practice lawyer in oplitch , and finally became the head of the office of labor relations .
in 1918 he was arrested at his home by police and taken to pernikowska prison in smolensk , where he stayed for three months before being released . at the end of the war he resumed his legal practice at magyar sokolovka and defended the interests of the `` the order of mac caspian `` , a group of polish and soviet jews , against attacks from anti-jewish sentiments . he died in 1937 from esophageal cancer , aged 81 .
fick 's greatest contribution to mathematical economics was the ponzi scheme ( as much as a play on the spelling of `` pyeat `` , which was compulsory for university enrollment ) that the jewish-american václav havel believed he was able to deploy against the people who had built up the property market following the defeat of the polish provisional government . however , this scheme made the impact of its success more immediate than the ponzi scheme . during the first world war , ramiro menéndez described fick as `` an economist of the highest quality ... and on the boundary between jew and capitalist . ``


== positions ==
fick spent much of his career in the united states . in 1920 he became a research fellow at the university of chicago , then transferred to princeton , new jersey in 1930 , where he worked with economist j. e. b. keller , and of course with the distinguished theoretical economists peter hassler and john kenneth galbraith . he also joined the board of trustees of case western reserve university in 1932 and became director of its industrial research center . the faculty member and emeritus professor of law at columbia university from 1938 to 1942 , fick lectured on the theory of real estate at the harvard graduate school of business and at the columbia school of forestry and environmental studies in the united states from 1948 to 1967 . he also advised president harry truman on trade and war issues , and he was an adviser to president lyndon johnson.in 1921 fick obtained for himself a membership of the académie des sciences et métiers in paris . in 1926 he became a foreign member of the société mathématique de france.fick retired in 1956 , after which he lived in greenwich village , connecticut , with his wife and his seven children . in 1962 he moved to chicago , where he was a professor emeritus at the depaul university law school . during the 1960s he worked on a joint labor settlement between the united auto workers and the united mine workers of america .


== personal life ==
born to a wealthy jewish family in naskowiec , belarus , fick married julia peyman in the united states in 1895 , in the year of the founding of the nazi party . he died in 1963 , and in 1967 his papers and those of his family were transferred to the national archives in washington d.c. , where he was buried in an unmarked grave .
